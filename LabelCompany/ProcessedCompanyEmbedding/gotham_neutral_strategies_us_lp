car loans and nonindex unicorns by matt levine mattlevine more stories by matt levine february    am est fannie and freddieyesterday the us court of appeals for the dc circuit handed down an odd decision in a lawsuit over the governments nationalization of fannie mae and freddie mac the key issue is whats called the third amendment the  transaction by which the government converted its previous bailout of fannie and freddie  which paid a  percent dividend that in practice ate up more than all of their profits  into an effective nationalization by which all of their profits were automatically swept to the government this amendment was controversial and for good reason it seemed like an unfair retrading of the deal that fannie and freddie had made with the government people who had invested in the companies preferred shares hoping theyd be worth something when the companies returned to profitability were understandably aggrieved and suedthey faced an uphill battle though because the statute that authorized the bailout the housing and economic recovery act of  says that no court may take any action to restrain or affect the exercise of powers or functions of the government as a conservator or a receiver for fannie or freddie the bulk of the dc circuit opinion is devoted to finding that this means what it says and that therefore the court cant undo the profit sweep in the third amendment the shareholders and the very strange dissenting opinion argue that this provision doesnt apply because the government wasnt really acting as a conservator a conservator is supposed to conserve the business not liquidate it and by giving all of the profits to the treasury the government was engaged in a de facto liquidation of the entities this strikes me as a confusion about what an entity is fannie and freddie havent been liquidated theyve been conserved quite nicely too nicely lots of people wish they would have been wound up by now but here they areof course the shareholders have been zeroed but no one thought that the government was supposed to conserve fannie and freddie on behalf of the shareholders if you think of a corporation as essentially a relationship between a business and its shareholders then the actions of the government seem like an obvious failure of conservatorship but theres no particular reason to think of fannie and freddie that way and as enterprises as businesses as functioning mortgagemarket entities theyve been conserved just finebut then theres a second part of the opinion sending the case back to the district court to consider whether fannie and freddie in signing the third amendment violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by throwing their preferred shareholders under the bus the preferred shareholders sort of had a right to dividends the decision to pay dividends or not was in the sole discretion of fannies or freddies board but the dividends were expected in the ordinary course if the enterprises were profitable and well capitalized and theres a background obligation for companies like fannie and freddie to in essence treat their shareholders fairly with respect to those dividends and if they dont the shareholders can sue for damages which unlike undoing the third amendment is not prohibited by hera  although damages in lieu of dividends might come to much the same thing so the court sent the case back for the district court to evaluate it under the correct legal standard namely whether the third amendment violated the reasonable expectations of the parties at the various times the class plaintiffs purchased their shares that seems awfully squishy and open to interpretation based on your prior preferences if you think the third amendment was a lawless seizure of private property for the government then this decision offers a lot of hope that the shareholders will get their money back if you think the governments dealings with fannie and freddie were a juddering but basically reasonable effort to respond to a massive crisis at governmentbacked enterprises then you probably dont think that the government violated any obligation of good faith and fair dealing the fact that the district judge dismissed this case once suggests that hes more in the latter camp but who knows in any case the common and preferred shares of fannie and freddie fell yesterday suggesting that shareholders were hoping for better from this decisionone of the strangest parts of the decision is the caption its perry capital llc v mnuchin because steven mnuchin the new treasury secretary is now the government official responsible for the fannie and freddie mess but he had nothing to do with the third amendment or the initial bailout or with any of the enterprises long bitter history he was also at last disclosure an investor in a hedge fund that owns fannie and freddie shares though he planned to divest he has been a little coy about the administrations plans for fannie and freddie but my suspicion is that the shareholders best chance to recover will come from negotiating with mnuchin not suing him kraftileverthe financial times has a fascinating recap of this past weekends failed kraft heinz co bid for unilever which has a little something for everyone for instance if you are interested in shorttermism and longtermism unilever chief executive officer paul polman and kraft heinzs backers at g capital offer a nice contrastby investing in its brands and promoting initiatives such as environmental sustainability mr polman has sacrificed shortterm profits for longevity in contrast g has rapidly transformed the consumer industry by slashing costs cutting jobs and raising profit marginsthere is the tactical chess game between bidder and target that when written down sounds a little thinthe group studied gbacked takeovers and concluded kraft heinz would try to seem as friendly as possible and then increase its bid in increments until there was sufficient pressure from unilever investors this was g’s modus operandi “we didn’t want to get in that situation so we needed to hit them early our best chance was to get them off the pitch early” said another person involved in the company’s defencethat is kraft heinz would be polite and try to bid enough to buy unilever without overpaying and unilevers best bet to get rid of them was to say no those tactics  do not seem  like  rocket science and yet unilever engaged an army of advisers some of this is just if you are fighting an existential battle for survival more advice cant hurt but some of it is also you cant run a multinational corporation on your ceos kneejerk aversion to selling to a rival the more banks you can get to analyze kraft heinzs bid and opine that its unfair the firmer ground youre on when you say no there is a fiduciaryprocess focus that probably protects shareholders here unilevers bankers came to understand what the us company was attempting to pull off synergies on the packagedfood business were enough to justify a big premium for the whole company giving kraft heinz the rest of unilever effectively for no premium though theres always a suspicion that the bankers are just telling the ceo what he wants to hear to confirm his initial kneejerk reactionspeaking of advisers being a consumergoods giant has some advantages in maback in london on saturday as mr polman tapped into his network of contacts he was informed that finsbury was working with kraft heinz on pr within seconds mr polman blasted off an email to sir martin sorrell the founder and chief executive of wpp the advertising company that counts unilever as one of its most important clients finsbury which is majority owned by wpp was removed from the kraft heinz side by the end of the daythe story of how the news broke even implicates the second law of insider tradingbut by last wednesday some investors and journalists had been notified about unusually high options trading in unilever’s uslisted sharesthat law is of course if you have inside information about an upcoming merger dont buy shortdated outofthemoney call options on the target but breaking it is apparently irresistibleorit seems to be a real thing including at gotham asset managementthe firm is in talks with some investors for its gotham neutral strategies hedge fund about charging one fee the greater of a  percent management fee or  percent of returns that exceed the fund’s benchmark according to two people familiar with the matter the equity fund currently charges  percent of assets in management fees and  percent of profits one of the people saidand its catching onas of midfebruary at least  multibilliondollar hedge funds worldwide are either in the process of implementing or have implemented the or fee structure that was introduced to the industry in the fourth quarter of  jonathan koerner of albourne partners said in a telephone interview on feb one basic point to make here is that those fees are just lower if you consistently return double your benchmark a performance fee of  percent of profits will be higher than a performance fee of  percent of profits in excess of the benchmark the breakeven is when you return triple your benchmark and of course a management fee of  percent of assets will be higher than a management fee of zero because you just get the performance fee this structure isnt cheaper in all scenarios and if youre a consistently amazing hedge fund manager you might prefer it to  and  but if youre really that consistently amazing you can just go ahead and charge  and  in most cases the or is not so much a reshuffling of fees to better align incentives as it is a fee cutthis of course makes sense the main complaint about hedge fund fees is just that theyre too high cutting from  and  to  and  would lower them but it would also be a little embarrassing and set a bad precedent the name of the game in so much of financial services is fee discipline raising one of the numbers in a way that likely lowers the overall fees lets the managers save some facenumeraireah this is cutenumerai has distributed numeraire— tokens in all—to  participating scientists the higher the scientists sit on the leaderboard the more numeraire they receive but it’s not really a currency they can use to pay for stuff it’s a way of betting that their machine learning models will do well on the live market if their trades succeed they get their numeraire back as well as a payment in bitcoin—a kind of dividend if their trades go bust the company destroys their numeraire and they don’t get paidthe new system encourages the data scientists to build models that work on live trades not just test data the value of numeraire also grows in proportion to the overall success of the hedge fund because numerai will pay out more bitcoin to data scientists betting numeraire as the fund growsnumerai is one of several quantcrowdsourcing firms a hedge fund in which an artificially intelligent system chooses all the trades and several thousand anonymous data scientists compete to create the best trading algorithms to populate that ai system like lots of hedge funds it has an incentivebased compensation system for its analystsportfolio managersscientistswhatever and like lots of incentivebased compensation systems this one has components both for individual performance you get more compensation the better you do and firm performance the value of your compensation grows in proportion to the overall success of the hedge fund and can be clawed back if your trades go bust again this is pretty standard hedge funds can pay analysts in the form of a share in the hedge fund itself the better they do the bigger share they get the better the fund does the more their share is worth if they go bust they forfeit their share there are nuances but this is essentially a solved problem in hedgefund compensationbut you can always just call it a cryptocurrency and have it pay dividends in bitcoin and set it up on the ethereum blockchain because blockchain blockchain blockchain blockchain blockchain in the future all equity will be renamed

group incs proprietary trade databasepricing modelgeneral repository of knowledge is actually a little on the antiquated side“you have to understand that secdb is an amazing platform with tons of genius ideas but that it’s  or  years old” says one former goldman insider “there were a lot of technology choices that were great for the business in the s and s but things are different now back then for example you might have had a couple of hundreds of thousands of trades a day but now – in electronic fx trading – you might have a million trades a day how do you scale a system that was built to work with s of thousand of trades to millions this is the problem for gs”one particular problem is that secdb was built before the rise of the python programming language and is mostly written in slang goldmans proprietary language this makes it more difficult for goldman to use opensource software for things like machine learning and also makes it harder to hire and train programmers i mention this mostly because i like the fact that goldman has a proprietary language called slang disclosure i used to work at goldman and i liked that fact then too though i cannot claim to be much of a slang programmerauto lendingwill the next financial crisis come from a bubble in auto lending ehh i dont know i think it would be a little too cute to have two us financial crises in a row that are both precipitated by securitized loans to consumers to finance durablegoods purchases financial crises usually show more creativity than that the next crisis will probably be in something weird like clearinghouse collateral or bond market illiquidity but the country’s auto debt hit a record in the fourth quarter of  according to the federal reserve bank of new york when a rush of yearend car shopping pushed vehicle loans to a dubious peak of  trillion and delinquencies among lowerrated borrowers have risen to the highest level since  so if you want to worry about it go

because it has echoes of the activepassive debate in investing i mean he uses those terms snap is a swing from passive consumption im bored  whats in the newsfeed to creation hence opening the app into the camera but more fundamentally evans talks about the big internet companies as being indexes of human behavior reflecting their users preferences rather than shaping them he says that instagram is following facebook and google and becoming another index or mirror  moving towards the behaviour of billions of people instead of the behaviour of millions of people and to surfing users rather than prescribing for them snapchat on the other hand is not an index instead of asking where metrics data and algorithms take us evans writes snap is looking for creationso one question for snapchat is whether you can get to a billion users without being an index no matter how many new things you create is the risk not that it gets overtaken by facebook but that it cant generalise enough thats obviously a specific concern with the specific character of the user experience today too hard for anyone over  but its also a much more basic question with the character of the product vision  can you scale from having insight and product vision around m people to having them for everyone meanwhile snap inc seems to be having a tough time on the roadshow for its initial public offering they
