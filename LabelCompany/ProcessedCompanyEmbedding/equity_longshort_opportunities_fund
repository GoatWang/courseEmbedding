longshort equity  wikipedia longshort equity from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search longshort equity is an investment strategy generally associated with hedge funds and more recently certain progressive traditional asset managers it involves buying long equities that are expected to increase in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in value this is different from the risk reversal strategies where investors will simultaneously buy a call option and sell a put option to simulate being long in a stock contents  overview  equitized strategy  hedging example  market neutral strategies  problems  references  external links overviewedit typically equity longshort investing is based on bottom up fundamental analysis of the individual companies in which investments are made there may also be top down analysis of the risks and opportunities offered by industries sectors countries and the macroeconomic situation longshort covers a wide variety of strategies there are generalists and managers who focus on certain industries and sectors or certain regions managers may specialize in a category — for example large cap or small cap value or growth there are many trading styles with frequent or dynamic traders and some longerterm investors a fund manager typically attempts to reduce volatility by either diversifying or hedging positions across individual regions industries sectors and market capitalization bands and hedging against undiversifiable risk such as market risk in addition to being required of the portfolio as a whole neutrality may in addition be required for individual regions industries sectors and market capitalization bands there is wide variation in the degree to which managers prioritize seeking high returns which may involve concentrated and leveraged portfolios and seeking low volatility which involves more diversification and hedging equitized strategyedit this is in addition to market neutral strategy as it adds a permanent stock index futures overlay which makes profit or losses depending on the movement of the market your portfolio then has a full equity market exposure hedging exampleedit a hedge fund might sell short one automobile industry stock while buying another—for example short  million of daimlerchrysler long  million of ford with this position any event that causes all auto industry stocks to fall will cause a profit on the daimlerchrysler position and a matching loss on the ford position similarly events that cause both stocks to rise—for example a rise in the market as a whole—will have little or no effect on the position presumably the hedge fund has sold daimlerchrysler and bought ford because the manager expects ford to perform better if the manager is correct the fund should profit irrespective of market and sector moves market neutral strategiesedit market neutral strategies can be seen as the limiting case of equity longshort in which the long and short portfolios of the fund are balanced with great care so that a very high degree of hedging is achieved some advantages of market neutral strategies include being able to generate positive returns in a down market and generating returns with a lower volatility profile market neutrality refers to hedging out market risk which can be managed through the use of derivatives such as

longshort an equity longshort strategy is an investing strategy used primarily by hedge funds that involves taking long positions in stocks that are expected to increase in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decrease in value you may know that taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it if the stock increases in value you will make money on the other hand taking a short position in a stock means borrowing a stock you don’t own usually from your broker selling it then hoping it declines in value at which time you can buy it back at a lower price than you paid for it and return the borrowed shares hedge funds using equity longshort strategies simply do this on a grander scale at its most basic level an equity longshort strategy consists of buying an undervalued stock and shorting an overvalued stock ideally the long position will increase in value and the short position will decline in value if this happens and the positions are of equal size the hedge fund will benefit that said the strategy will work even if the long position declines in value provided that the long position outperforms the short position thus the goal of any equity longshort strategy is to minimize exposure to the market in general and profit from a change in the difference or spread between two stocks that may sound complicated so let’s look at a hypothetical example let’s say a hedge fund takes a  million long position in pfizer and a  million short position in wyeth both large pharmaceutical companies with these positions any event that causes all pharmaceutical stocks to fall will lead to a loss on the pfizer position and a profit on the wyeth position similarly an event that causes both stocks to rise will have little effect since the positions balance each other out so the market risk is minimal why then would a portfolio manager take such a position because he or she thinks pfizer will perform better than wyeth equity longshort strategies such as the one described which hold equal dollar amounts of long and short positions are called market neutral strategies but not all equity longshort strategies are market neutral some hedge fund managers will maintain a long bias as is the case with socalled “” strategies with these strategies hedge funds have  exposure to long positions and  exposure to short positions other structures are also used such as  long and  short few hedge funds have a longterm short bias since the equity markets tend to move up over time equity longshort managers can also be distinguished by the geographic market in which they invest the sector in which they invest financial health care or technology for example or their investment style value or quantitative for example buying and selling two related stocks—for example two stocks in the same region or industry—is called a “paired trade” model it may limit risk to a specific subset of the market instead of the market in general equity longshort strategies have been used by sophisticated investors such as institutions for years they became increasingly popular among individual investors as traditional strategies struggled in the most recent bear market highlighting the need for investors to consider expanding their portfolios into innovative financial solutions   equity longshort strategies are not without risks these strategies have all the generic hedge fund risks for example hedge funds are typically not as liquid as mutual funds meaning it is more difficult to sell shares the strategies they use could lead to significant losses and they can have high fees additionally equity longshort strategies have some unique risks the main one is that the portfolio manager must correctly predict the relative performance of two stocks which can be difficult another risk results from what is referred to in the industry as “beta mismatch” while this is more complicated that we can explain in detail here essentially it means that when the stock market declines sharply long positions could lose more than short positions in summary equity longshort strategies may help increase returns in difficult market environments but also involve some risk as a result investors considering these strategies may want to ensure that their hedge funds follow strict rules to evaluate market risks and find good

strategies long short hedge fund strategies merger arbitrage next tutorialinvestment and consumptionvideo transcriptlets say ive been researching some stocks to potentially invest in and i feel pretty good at my ability to predict how good a companys going to do relative to peoples expectations or the markets expectations and in particular i focus on companies a and b and in the case of company a i think its going to do a lot worse than the market expects it to do so im tempted to short it and in the case of company b i think its going to do much better than the market expects so im tempted to buy it or go long but theres one thing about this process that gets me a little bit uncomfortable i have confidence in my ability to pick out companies that are going to outperform the market or are going to underperform the market but i have no confidence in my ability to predict to the market so in general let me draw a little chart of the market this is the market price maybe this is the sp  or the nasdaq and ive just found that its as good as random as opposed to me trying to pick out bottoms of the markets or tops of the markets and all the rest and so my fear is what happens if i buy company b based on my sound research and then the market goes down then company b will probably still go down maybe it wont go down as much as the market but it will still go down and ill lose money or what if i short company a and the market goes up maybe company a wont go a wont go up as much as the market but ill still lose money on my short position which is essentially a bet that the stock is going to go down so is there some arrangement i can do some combination of buying company b and selling or shorting company a that will essentially hedge out a lot of this market risk and as you can imagine there is and i wont go into all of the statistics of it and beta and you can really try to statistically hedge out the market risk but the general idea is if you really think this is going to outperform the market or definitely outperform company a and if you think a going to underperform the market or definitely underperform relative to company b you can buy a similar amount of b as you will short company a so in this case lets just do one share you can obviously do multiples of this you buy one let me write it over here so you buy one share of company b and you sell or you short one share of company a you borrow the share you sell it youll have to buy it at a future date so you short i shouldnt say one share you short two shares of company a and the reason why im saying two shares of company a instead of one share is because a is only  per share and b is  per share so i want to do roughly the same amount and once again you can do fancier statistics on it to tweak it so you can see how much they actually move with the market but were not going to worry about that right here so for simplicity what weve done here is weve taken a long position let me write it over here weve taken a long position in b and we have a  long position and weve taken a short position in a and it is also a  short position once again because a is  per share so we took two shares of a it makes the same dollar amount now and maybe ill save this for the next video i want you to think about what happens if the market moves up or down but b outperforms a or a outperforms bhedge funds

have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem

in the strategies they manage on behalf of fund investorsphilosophy  disciplinewe are looking for managers that do not follow the herd mentality and try to provide a unique edge and alpha to their strategies  we believe unique investment managers are defined by several distinguishing traitsthe manager has successfully implemented an investment strategy over at least one full market cycle  there are periods between cycles when managers can generate high returns and low volatility by either explicitly or indirectly latching onto a specific high performing factor exposure  it is not until the end of a market cycle after the prior excesses have been unwound when we can then sufficiently evaluate the true sources of performance the sustainability of the investment strategy and the manager’s attitude towards risk managementwe strongly prefer small and medium sized investment management firms as subadvisors for our funds  we believe there is an inflection point in the lifecycle of an investment firm where the distractions associated with managing a growing business become an impediment to investment performance  our subadvisors eat their own cooking and have great passion for the investment process  they hire world class middle and backoffice professionals to minimize the time they spend away from managing the portfolioas a corollary to our feelings on business structure we partner with investment professionals who have clearly defined the capacity constraints associated with their strategies we know that in most cases a portfolio manager’s ability to implement the strategy upon which the firm’s successful track record has been built is directly compromised at specific aum thresholds  our subadvisors will not compromise performance in pursuit of value destroying objectiveswe require strong alignment of interests between our subadvisors and investors in our mutual fund products  our subadvisors have significant investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of fund investors  they also have a strong focus on our strategies with limited external business diversionswe believe our subadvisors possess skills attributes and proficiencies that provide a clear competitive advantage distinguishing their strategies as unique  we have collectively evaluated thousands of managers including who we believe are some of the best and brightest from a broad

periods past performance is no guarantee of future results since it purchases equity securities including common stocks the fund is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time  these factors contribute to price volatility which is the principal risk of investing in the fund    the fund may focus its investments from time to time on one or more economic sectors  to the extent that it does so developments affecting companies in that sector or sectors will likely have a magnified effect on the fund’s net asset value and total return the fund is subject to the risks associated with selling securities short a short sale involves a finite opportunity for appreciation but a theoretically unlimited risk of loss  the smaller capitalization companies the fund invests in may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies therefore small cap stock prices may be more volatile than those of larger companies the fund is subject to risks due to its foreign investments  foreign investments may be riskier than us investments because of factors such as foreign government restrictions changes in currency exchange rates incomplete financial information about the issuers of securities and political or economic instability  foreign stocks may be more volatile and less liquid than us stocks the risks associated with foreign investments are heightened when investing in emerging markets such investments tend to fluctuate in price more widely and to be less liquid than other foreign investment the fund is subject to risks associated with the use of options including  the success of a hedging strategy may depend on an ability to predict movements in the prices of individual securities fluctuations in markets and movements in interest rates  there may be an imperfect correlation between the movement in prices of options and the securities underlying them  there may not be a liquid secondary market for options and  while the fund will receive a premium when it writes call options it may not participate fully in a rise in the market value of the underlying security
