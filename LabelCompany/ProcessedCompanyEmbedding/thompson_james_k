sunbeam mixer thompson dep pp  she removed the mixer from the box to test it to make sure it worked thompson dep p  the box included an instruction booklet which included the language important safeguards in enlarged capital letters at the top of the page and the language read all instructions before use in slightly smaller capital letters under the important safeguards section was a bullet point stating unplug from outlet while not in use before putting on or taking off parts and before cleaning another bullet point in that section stated avoid contact with moving parts keep hands hair clothing as well as spatulas and other utensils away from beaters during operation to reduce the risk of injury to persons andor damage to the hand mixer the next page of the instruction booklet included a section in enlarged capital letters on installing attachments under this heading the manual stated make sure the speed control is in the off position and unplugged from an electrical outlet insert attachments one at a time by placing stem end into the opening on the bottom of the mixer turn attachment slightly and push in until it clicks into position see figure a plug into the appropriate outlet turn mixer on and adjust speed setting using the control on the top of the unit the manual also contained a section in enlarged capital letters entitled ejecting beaters this

been employed by sunbeam since  prins dep p  the mixer purchased by mrs thompson has a ul listing mark on it that indicated that the product was ul approved prins dep p  prins was previously employed by underwriters laboratories ul a business which generates safety standards for products and tests products for compliance with those standards prins dep p  products bearing the ul mark must submit the product to ul for testing and the product must be manufactured in accordance with the submitted product specifications prins dep p  ul also conducts four unannounced inspections of the manufacturing facility to make sure that the product is still in compliance and completes additional testing of samples of the product once a year prins dep p  the mixer purchased by mrs thompson was the sunbeam mixmaster model  which was manufactured and designed by simatelex a chinese corporation prins dep pp  after a mixer design is submitted to sunbeam and approved by sunbeams marketing department the design is submitted to the engineering department to start a product specification prins dep pp   the design goes through a qualification process which includes a thirdparty testing by ul prins dep p  ul tests the design to its standards the design goes through an engineering build in a prepilot manufacturing and production area and must meet certain quality criteria established by the engineering department prins dep pp  the mixer is also subjected to life testing long continuous operation and heavy load testing prins dep pp  when the mixer is in production at simatelex sunbeams quality organization in hong kong goes to the plant verifies that the manufacturer performed required tests and randomly picks samples to make sure that the mixers are properly packaged and operate properly prins dep pp  the mixers usually have their switches in the off position when packaged but the user could inadvertently hit the switch while using the handle to remove the mixer from the package prins dep p  prins had received no reports from quality assurance that the user manual was not found in the sample boxes prins dep p  sunbeams engineering marketing and legal departments were involved in authoring the instruction manual for the mixer the important safeguards section of the manual in black text was written to comply with the ul  standard for electric household food preparing equipment prins dep p  dubois dep p  a manufacturer is permitted to add language to the ul minimum required language but the additional language must be approved by ul prins dep pp   the warnings included with the sunbeam mixmaster met industry standards prins dep p  prins had seen no reports on the mixer from the consumer product safety commission which investigates reports of injury prins dep p  he was unaware of any other cases of injuries from the use of this particular hand mixer and was aware of one other report of a finger injury from the use of another mixer with a broken part prins dep pp   prins stated that he did not believe that there was an increased risk of wearing jewelry or rings while operating the mixer because the warnings instructed the user to avoid contact with moving parts and to keep hands hair clothing and utensils away from the beaters prins dep p  prins was unaware of any safety standards for kitchen equipment which advised against wearing jewelry during operation although he had seen it in the industrial or manufacturing context where jewelry could accidently catch on operator buttons thereby inadvertently actuating the manufacturing machine prins dep pp  prins had seen no technical bulletins or recall notices regarding the mixer prins dep pp  he testified that placing a guard around the outside of the beaters to protect against injury would also prevent food mixing prins dep p  he was unaware of any mechanical device which would reduce the risk of injury without compromising the utility of the mixer prins dep p  lawrence dubois an engineer and manager of the materials and product testing department at ctl engineering for thirty years was retained by sunbeam to examine the hand mixer involved in this case in his report dated november   doc  dubois stated that the mixer operated properly and functioned as designed the onoff switch operated normally no damage to the mixer was noted the motor and beaters operated as expected the eject button operated properly and the engagement of the beaters was secure when they were properly installed as evidenced by a clicking sound he found no evidence of any malfunctions or manufacturing or design defects in the mixer he could not say whether there was a pinch point on the mixer since he did not evaluate the mixer to determine if there was a pinch point dubois dep pp  a pinch point occurs where at least one movable component in the machinery comes into close proximity or direct contact with another component of the machinery dubois dep p  dubois saw no evidence on the beaters that they had come into contact with a hard object such as a ring since the photograph of the rings did not show any damage to the ring dubois had trouble understanding how the beaters would catch a ring and pull the ring finger into the beaters dubois dep p  he was also unaware of any injuries to the ring side of the hand which would be consistent with the ring pulling the hand into the beaters and causing injury to the area around the ring dubois dep p  dubois also reviewed the users manual noting the instruction to avoid contact with moving parts to keep hands hair clothing and utensils away from the beaters during operation and to unplug the mixer before putting on or taking off parts he concluded from mrs thompsons deposition testimony that she violated these warnings when she attempted to push a loose beater back into the mixer with her hand while it was operating and that she failed to properly insert the beaters dubois stated that additional warnings concerning wearing jewelry would not have prevented mrs thompsons injury because she testified that placing her hand against the moving beaters was reactionary dubois stated in his report warnings do not protect against such reactions dubois also noted that it would be unrealistic to construct the mixer so as not to expose moving parts because exposed moving parts are an inherent necessity in the operation of a hand mixer for its intended use and are permitted by ul  he stated that he was only aware of a prohibition against wearing jewelry around machinery in one instance involving a piece of manufacturing equipment dubois dep pp  plaintiffs retained lewis barbe a safety engineer with occupational safety and health services as an expert witness in his report doc  barbe concluded that the instructions provided with the mixer were inadequate in that they did not specifically warn against wearing jewelry around the moving parts barbe also concluded in his report that the mixer was defective because sunbeam failed to construct a mixer without exposed moving parts however he stated in his deposition that he was not criticizing the mixer for having exposed moving parts and that he was not offering an opinion concerning whether the mixer had a manufacturing or design defect barbe dep pp   barbe concluded that the defects in the warnings were the proximate cause of mrs thompsons injuries mr barbe testified at his deposition that he did not examine the actual mixer at issue in this case and did not test the mixer barbe dep pp  he did not know which beater fell out and did not know in which direction the beaters rotated barbe dep p  mr barbe was unaware of any other cases where a person was injured wearing jewelry while operating a sunbeam mixer barbe dep p  he opined that the statements in the instruction manual were not warnings because they did not include some signal such as the word danger lettering in a different color or an exclamation point barbe dep pp   ii

accompanied the mixer which specifically warned users to avoid contact with moving parts keep hands hair clothing as well as spatulas and other utensils away from beaters during operation to reduce the risk of injury to persons andor damage to the hand mixer if this cautionary instruction is heeded the mixer is safe to use for its intended function witness the fact that neither party has cited

that is not safe this word is the literal equivalent of danger in addition the user is instructed to keep body parts and clothing away from the beaters during operation to reduce the risk of injury to persons barbe also objected to the warnings on the ground that they did not specifically advise the user to remove jewelry such as rings prior to operating the mixer the court notes that although plaintiffs allege that the injury was the result of mrs thompsons ring being caught in the beaters mrs thompson never testified that the moving beater hit her ring the record includes what purports to be an unauthenticated emergency room report in which it is stated that mrs thompson caught her ring finger in some sort of blender mechanism and that it looks like it caught her rings and created an

specifically mention clothing and a ring is worn on the body as are articles of clothing defendants were not required to include in the warnings an exhaustive list of the specific types of clothing jewelry or other articles which might come into contact with the beaters the language instructed users to keep their hands away from the moving parts plaintiffs expert lewis barbe did not explain why the warning about keeping ones hands away from the beater was not adequate to prevent injury from wearing a ring even barbe agreed that if the user followed the instruction to keep his or her hands away from the beaters during operation the users hand would not be caught in the beaters and the user would not be injured barbe dep pp  he also agreed that the beaters would never take a persons

there is no evidence that any of these circumstances were present in the instant case there is also no evidence that walmart or any of its employees made any representations to mrs thompson when she purchased the hand mixer which would establish liability under § a  mrs thompson testified at her deposition that she did not speak to any walmart employee about the mixer when she purchased it and that no one at walmart made any representations to her concerning how the product would function thompson dep pp  walmart is entitled to summary judgment on the fifth cause of action g claims under the cspa in the tenth cause of action plaintiffs have alleged claims against the defendants under the cspa the cspa prohibits suppliers from committing either unfair or deceptive consumer sales practices as listed in § or unconscionable acts or practices as described in § in general the cspa defines unfair or deceptive consumer sales practices as those that mislead consumers about the nature of the product they are receiving while unconscionable acts or practices relate to a supplier manipulating a consumers understanding of the nature of the transaction at issue johnson v microsoft corp  ohio std    ned   the cspa applies to consumer transactions including the sale of an item of goods to an individual for purposes that are primarily personal family or household see ohio rev code § a plaintiffs do not address defendants arguments concerning the cspa claims in their memorandum contra defendants motion for summary judgment on these claims there is no evidence in the record that defendants engaged in any unfair or deceptive act or practice as described in section  a or any unconscionable act or practice as described in section  adefendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs claims under the cspa h common law product liability claims defendants argue that the common law product liability claims asserted in causes of action six through nine thirteen and fourteen are product liability claims within the meaning of ohio rev code §  and are preempted by the opla the opla was amended effective april   to state that §§ to  are intended to abrogate all common law product liability claims or causes of action ohio rev code § b in uncodified commentary contained in  sb  the general assembly stated in regard to § b that it was intended to supersede the holding of the ohio supreme court in carrel v allied prods corp   ohio std  that the commonlaw product liability cause of action of negligent design survives the enactment of the ohio product liability act sections  to  of the revised code and to abrogate all common law product liability causes of action courts which have addressed the issue have concluded that the opla preempts common law product liability claims see hale v enerco group inc no cvdap  wl  at  nd ohio  mitchell v proctor  gamble no cv  wl  at  sdohio march   moeller v auglaize erie machine co no  rd dist  wl  at  ohio app jan   miles  fsuppd at  stratford v smithkline beecham corp no cv  wl  at  sd ohio june   routzahn v garrison no  nd dist  wl  at  ohio app july   plaintiffs sixth cause of action breach of implied warranties and plaintiffs seventh cause of action breach of express warranties fall within the definition of a product liability claim which expressly includes any failure of the product to conform to any relevant representation or warranty §  c these warranty claims are preempted by the opla miles  fsuppd at  plaintiffs claim for common law product liability their eighth cause of action also alleges acts which are addressed under the opla defective manufacture and construction are included under § defects in design and formulation are included under § defects due to inadequate warning or instruction are contained in § defects due to nonconformance with a manufacturers representations are addressed in § the eighth cause of action is therefore preempted as is plaintiffs ninth cause of action for strict product liability in their thirteenth cause of action plaintiffs allege a claim for breach of express or implied contract against walmart plaintiffs allege that walmart represented that the hand mixer was not unreasonably dangerous inherently dangerous or defective the fact that this claim is pleaded as a breach of contract claim is not controlling as under ohio law it is the substance of the claim not the manner in which it is pleaded that determines how it is treated see lawyers coop publg co v meuthing  ohio std    ned   the claim asserted in the thirteenth cause of action is encompassed within the opla which states that a supplier is liable if the plaintiff establishes that the product did not conform when it left the control of the supplier in question to a representation made by the supplier and that representation and the failure to conform to it were a proximate cause of harm for which the claimant seeks to recover compensatory damages ohio rev code § a  therefore the thirteenth cause of action is preempted by the opla finally plaintiffs fourteenth cause of action asserts a claim of negligence stating that the defendants had a duty to provide a product to consumers that was not unreasonably or inherently dangerous or defective and that defendants breached this duty this cause of action falls within the scope of the opla and is preempted even if plaintiffs common law causes of action are addressed on the merits defendants are entitled to summary judgment on those claims for the reasons stated above in addressing those same claims under the opla defendants are entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs causes of action six through nine thirteen and fourteen i loss of consortium a loss of consortium claim is a derivative claim that can be maintained only if the primary cause of action is proven vinicky v pristas  ohio appd    ned   citing bowen v kilkare inc  ohio std    ned   since this court has determined that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on all of mrs thompsons substantive claims defendants are also entitled to summary judgment on the twelfth cause of action mr thompsons loss of consortium claim iii motion to exclude expert testimony in light of the courts ruling on the motion for summary judgment this court need not address defendants motion in limine and it is denied as moot iv conclusion in accordance with the foregoing defendants motion in limine doc  is denied as moot defendants motion for summary judgment doc no  is granted the clerk is instructed to enter final judgment in favor of the defendants on all of plaintiffs claims footnotes  although the claim for punitive damages is denominated as a cause of action in the complaint it is not in fact a cause of action see hitchings v weese  ohio std    ned   in ohio no civil cause of action may be maintained simply for punitive damages rather punitive damages are awarded as an incident of the cause of action in which they are sought and are simply a remedy for other claims moskovitz v mt sinai med ctr  ohio std    ned   thus if plaintiffs substantive claims do not survive the remedy of punitive damages is unavailable as well  this courts computer research through the federal and state directories likewise disclosed only one reported product liability case involving a kitchen mixer see burke v hamilton beach div scovill mfg co  ad  me  in that case a safety mechanism on a twentyyearold mixer failed and allowed the beaters to turn while the plaintiff was inserting them comment your name your email comments
