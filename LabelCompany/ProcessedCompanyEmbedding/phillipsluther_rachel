chief marketing officer of jamba juice nasdaq jmba rachel phillipsluther will lead the company’s brand marketing team and oversee new product innovation phillipsluther joined jamba which will relocate from emeryville california to frisco later this year on aug  she previously held the same position with planobased restaurant chain zoës kitchen nyse zoes where she contributed to the company’s initial public offering and led a brand repositioning enlarge rachel phillipsluther jamba juices chief marketing officer kelly williams kelly williams photography she said she made the leap to the juice and smoothie brand to continue working with healthy hospitality companies “hospitality has been my focus and there’s a lot of companies in that vertical but not many are focusing on food and beverage with healthy living” phillipsluther said “jamba has the same feel as zoës focusing on healthful living so i felt it embodied my mission as a marketer” the dallas business journal broke in may the news that jamba juice is relocating its headquarters to frisco’s hall office park where it will occupy roughly  square feet including a squarefoot test kitchen and retail store front the move will also bring more than  corporate jobs to north texas phillipsluther told the dbj more about her new role and how she will be a part of the company’s move what is your first task as you start in this role any time i walk into a new opportunity the first thing i aim to do is understand the current state of the brand and partnerships that exist today i’m putting my arms around our franchise partnerships and understanding the brand from the inside out the brand is built by the teams that deliver the experience so i’ll be working with the team in california and visiting stores over the next few weeks so i can assess how i can help amplify what makes jamba juice special how is the role different from your previous position with zoes in many ways the role is parallel at zoës i had the opportunity to build the brand from the ground up at jamba that opportunity presented itself as jamba moves from california and rebuilds a team the most specific difference is that at zoës we were primarily companyowned at jamba i’ll be working more with franchise partners and at zoës i didn’t have primary responsibility over rd and menu innovation what strategies do you have to help jamba differentiate from other juice and smoothie concepts those are some of the things we’ll be working through in the coming months the real opportunity is to understand the intrinsic benefits of the brand from a functional perspective jamba has a superior product when we talk about what goes into the cup there’s no sugar added it’s whole fruit beyond that jamba has been at the intersection of fit and fun so we’ll be looking at how to amplify that in a way that consumers get what do you hope to achieve within your first year at jamba we definitely believe there’s enormous opportunity to grow samestore sales growth the goal would be to better understand any new or lapsed users through consumer insights and then build a plan to attract them to the brand how will you be part of the company’s move to north texas our ceo dave pace our leaderships team and myself share a common vision that the people who support the business every day will make or break the business so we’re making sure there’s a knowledge transfer and culture transfer and there are a group of jamba employees that are going to be making the move with us on the flip side we’re in the midst of hiring team members that can help drive the brand the team members here will be going not only through store training but they’ll be spending time with me and our marketing team to understand the brand and culture related
