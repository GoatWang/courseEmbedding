were named runners up for april  what is the frontrunners quadrant a graphic of the topperforming accounting products frontrunners quadrants highlight the top software products for north american small businesses all products in the quadrant are top performers small businesses can use frontrunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them to create this quadrant we evaluated over  accounting products those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant scores are based largely on reviews from real software users along with other product performance details eg what features they offer how many customers they have is one quadrant better than the others nope products in any quadrant may fit your needs every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability how much the products can do and value whether they’re worth their pricecost that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success frontrunners has four subquadrants upper right  leaders leaders are allaround strong products they offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers these products are considered highly valuable by customers   upper left  masters masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than leaders do if you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles then a product in the masters quadrant might be right for you   lower right  pacesetters pacesetters may offer a strong set of features but are not rated as highly on value for example a pacesetter might offer greater functionality but cost more   lower left  contenders contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point this makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs depending on the specific needs of a software buyer a product in any of these subquadrants could be a good fit why to even be considered for this frontrunners a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of  for capability and  for value this means that all products that qualify as frontrunners are topperforming products in their market they appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed for some buyers a specific frontrunners subquadrant might be best this is because products in the pacesetters and leaders subquadrants are going to have a more extensive feature set than products in the contenders or masters what this means is that while all the products on the quadrant meet our minimum market criteria in this case core accounting and financial reporting and at least one of the following fixed asset management and expense management products in the pacesetters and leaders are going to offer additional features as well such as budgeting and forecasting inventory or payroll conversely products in the contenders and masters subquadrants are going to focus more exclusively on the core functionality you can download the full frontrunners for accounting report here it contains individual scorecards for each product on the frontrunners quadrant how are frontrunners products selected products are scored based on user reviews and other data you can find the full frontrunners methodology here but the gist is that products are scored in two areas capability and value to be considered at all products must have at least  reviews and meet minimum user rating scores they also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example core accounting and financial reporting as well as at least one of the following fixed asset management and expense management from there user reviews and other product performance details such as the products customer base and the features it offers dictate the capability and value scores capability is plotted on the xaxis and value is plotted on the yaxis got it but what if i have more questions check out our additional resources for more

business books including general ledger functionality the ability to track accounts payable ap and accounts receivable ar fixed assets and bank reconciliation every business requires these core functions to manage its finances project accounting this type of system helps projectoriented businesses maximize job profitability and efficiency by tracking detailed project costs businesses can

systems designed to support the wide range of industries business models payment methods and operational scales budgeting  forecasting users can leverage budgeting and forecasting solutions to project a companys financial outlook from historical data and estimate future conditions these systems are typically used in businesses that must consolidate multiple departmental forecasts and budgets and

reports on a regular basis automated reminders to pay required fees help businesses avoid legal penalties what type of buyer are you before evaluating your options you must determine what type of buyer you are over  percent of buyers fall into one of these three categories growing smallbusiness buyers these businesses are on the verge of upgrading basic systems such as quickbooks to more robust smallbusiness accounting systems that will support sophisticated functions such as demand forecasting intercompany accounts increased data storage and others growing businesses upgrade their systems for a range of reasons industryspecific functionality will become important when a small company reaches a certain size threshold enterprise buyers these buyers represent businesses and organizations that need the functionality of a full enterprise resource planning erp suite usually these systems will include functionality for multicompany consolidation international operations and foreign currency and other concerns relevant to large entities seamless integration is usually more important than specific features however there is considerable differentiation in both of these areas and buyers should examine both sap and oracle two of the largest vendors have some of the most featurerich systems on the market bestofbreed buyers these buyers are focused on specific functions for example nonprofit organizations need to look specifically for accounting software for business that can perform fund accounting this method tracks funds in such a way that different grant providers can see the right report on how each fund amount has been used meanwhile in education universities and colleges often need software specific to higher ed for example to track the disbursement of financial aid construction companies or engineering firms on the other hand usually need a system that can break down costs by each project location and other characteristics for bestofbreed buyers like these functionality is often more important than integration benefits  potential issues the key benefits of financial management systems are clear better visibility of costs and expenditures which leads to more financially responsible decisionmaking in addition systems can generate reports in a variety of ways to summarize this information cleanly for the right audience for example nonprofits can generate reports specific to a particular grant provider detailing exactly where every cent of the funding ended up this allows an organization to be accountable to investors donors and lenders maintaining trust and avoiding financial damage these systems also allow companies to ensure compliance with reporting standards and federal requirements there are a number of issues that should be avoided when selecting a solution buyers in certain vertical industries must make sure the appropriate modules are included in the system they purchase for example engineering firms and construction companies should choose a system with a project accounting module another issue is a companys rate of growth the buyer should consider how fast the company is growing at the time of purchase this way the company will not grow out of a system immediately after investing considerable time and funds in the selection and implementation processes market trends you should understand as you evaluate accounting software packages consider these current market trends softwareasaservice saas saas is picking up speed as buyers realize the advantages of lower upfront costs and quicker implementation time netsuite is a prominent example of a saas system in fact it is available only as a saas offering mobile apps mobile applications are gaining popularity across the board and accounting is no exception check to see how each vendor is innovating on this front increased specialization by industry increasingly consumers are demanding more industryspecific features and vendors are listening products that were once “horizontal”—such as sage mas  quickbooks and microsoft dynamics—are increasingly adding new vertical features to cater to buyers’ specific industries make sure to keep a lookout for features that fit your particular industry when investigating tools and solutions business intelligence interest in business intelligence is on the rise
