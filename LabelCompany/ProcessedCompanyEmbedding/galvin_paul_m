corporation the company had officially incorporated the day before in  galvin would introduce the motorola radio the first massproduced commercial car radio the name had two parts “motor” evoked cars and motion while “ola” derived from “victrola” and was supposed to make people think of music in  engineer paul galvin and his friend edward stewart started a storagebattery factory in marshfield wisconsin it went out of business two years later in  galvin and stewart restarted their batterymanufacturing company this time in chicago that one went out of business too but not before the partners figured out a way for home radios to draw power from an electrical wall outlet they called it the drybattery eliminator galvin bought back the eliminator part of his bankrupt company at auction for  and went right back into business building and repairing eliminators and ac radio sets for customers like sears roebuck soon however galvin’s attention turned to the carradio business the first car radios–portable “travel radios” powered by batteries followed by custominstalled builtin radios that cost  apiece about  in today’s dollars–had appeared in  but they were way too expensive for the average driver if he could find a way to massproduce affordable car radios galvin thought he’d be rich in june  he enlisted inventors elmer wavering and william lear to retrofit his old studebaker with a radio and drove  miles to the radio manufacturers association’s annual meeting in atlantic city he parked outside the convention turned up the music for this purpose wavering had installed a special speaker under the studebaker’s hood and waited for the rmaers’ orders to come rolling in a few did and galvin sold enough of his  t car radios to come close to breaking even for the year he changed his company’s name to motorola and changed the way we drive–and ride in–cars forever for his part william lear went on to invent the eighttrack cartridgetape system which came standard in every ford car starting in  meanwhile carmakers developed their own radiomanufacturing divisions gradually squeezing motorola out of the market it had built the company stopped making car radios in

senior winners medal in hurling after backtoback county final defeats in  and  lixnaw were back in  and faced abbeydorney a third defeat in four years looked extremely likely however galvin was the

the opposition off the pitch an enormous – to – victory gave galvin a second county winners medal after surrendering the hurling title the following year lixnaw were back to reclaim it in  kilmoyley

january  media reports suggested that galvin was poised for a club transfer from finuge to st vincents in dublin but his club teammate and former member of the kerry management team éamonn fitzmaurice rubbished those reports via twitter minor and underedit galvin first came to prominence on the intercounty scene as a member of the kerry minor football team in the late s he lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in  with limerick providing the opposition the game was a huge triumph for the kingdom as galvins side won by – to – it was his first munster winners medal at minor level kerry were later defeated in the subsequent allireland semifinal the same year he won an allireland vocational schools championship with the kerry vocational schools team following victory over tyrone in the final galvins performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the kerry under team in  the provincial decider that year pitted kerry against archrivals cork a close game developed however after the sixty minutes kerry were the champions by – to – it was galvins only munster under winners medal an allireland final appearance followed for galvin with westmeath providing the opposition kerry were the favourites going into the game however the leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers a narrow – to – score line resulted in defeat for galvins side galvin continued to play for the kerry under team for another two seasons however he enjoyed little further success senioredit galvin first played at intercounty senior level for kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late s he made a number of appearances with the team during the nhl during this time galvin joined the kerry senior football team in the early s however he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen in  he renewed his rivalry with limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider a – to – victory gave galvin a first munster winners medal in the senior grade after an exciting game with roscommon kerry advanced to an allireland semifinal meeting with tyrone after being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match the whole team struggled and kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new blanket defence that was introduced by teams like armagh and perfected by tyrone many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like ó sé and colm cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness a humiliating – to – defeat saw tyrone advance to the allireland final while kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship  saw galvin become an integral part of the kerry team the year began well with kerry reaching the final of the national league an exciting – to – victory saw kerry claim the title and galvin picked up a first national football league winners medal kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and for the second year in succession limerick were the opponents surprisingly that game ended in a – apiece draw the replay was also a closerun affair however kerry never really looked in danger of losing a – to – victory gave galvin a second munster winners medal the allireland series proved no difficulty for kerry and the kingdom booked their place in the allireland final against mayo an early goal from alan dillon gave the connacht men some hope however the game was effectively over after twentyfive minutes when colm cooper scored kerrys only goal of the day the points kept coming from galvins team and an injurytime michael conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for mayo a – to – victory gave galvin an allireland winners medal galvin was later presented with his first allstar the th award since the scheme began in  in  kerry were hot favourites to retain their allireland title all was going to plan as galvins side reached yet another provincial final in a return to tradition cork were the opponents a close game developed however in the end kerry were the narrow winners by – to – it was galvins third consecutive munster winners medal following this win kerry cruised through the allireland series to reach another championship decider with tyrone providing the opposition in one of the great finals of the decade the result remained in doubt until the final whistle dara ó cinnéide powered kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes tyrone responded in kind with a peter canavan goal just before halftime tomás ó sé launched the kerry comeback in the th minute with kerrys second goal however it was too later tyrone hung on to win by – to – it was galvins first defeat in an allireland final in  kerry reached the final of the national league and played galway galvins side could only manage three points in the opening half however the introduction of eoin brosnan transformed the team at the end of the seventy minutes a – to – score line gave kerry their th national league title and a second for galvin the league win was a false dawn as kerry went out tamely to cork in a replay of the munster final the team however bounced back against longford to set up a meeting with armagh in the allireland quarterfinal at halftime it looked as though the ulser hoodoo would strike again but kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of – to – the game was not without incident as galvin was redcarded for an altercation with the armagh water carrier kerry again beat cork in the subsequent semifinal before lining out against mayo in the allireland final an unbelievable opening firsthalf saw kerry go – to no score ahead after just ten minutes courtesy of goals by declan osullivan and kieran donaghy colm cooper slotted a third kerry goal however mayo settled and reduced the deficit to – to – at halftime the second thirtyfive minutes saw kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points a final score of – to – gave kerry another allireland title and gave galvin a second allireland winners medal galvin finished off the year with a second allstar award  saw kerry face cork in the provincial decider once again a close game developed however at the fulltime whsitle kerry were the champions by – to – it was ó galvins fourth munster winners medal kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their allireland quarterfinal against monaghan setting up a glamour allireland semifinal tie with dublin kerry saw off a great dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points the subsequent allireland final was an historic occasion as kerry faced cork in the very first allmunster championship decider while the first half was played on an even keel the kingdom ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued cork goalkeeper alan quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals at the fulltime whistle cork were trounced by – to – it was a third allireland medal for galvin and the first completion of backtoback allireland titles since cork in  and  in  galvin was appointed captain of the kerry team it was a great honour  what should have been a dream season for the finuge man particularly since kerry were attempting to capture a first threeinarow of allireland titles since  the kingdoms championship opener against clare was a dark moment for galvin the game was a largely lowkey affair except for one controversial incident between referee paddy russell and galvin russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of russells hand galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card the incident has been described as due to the frustration he felt at being booked for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his clare marker galvin received a sixmonth suspension however this was later reduced to twelve weeks it looked at this stage that galvins dream season was in tatters kerry drove on without him and reached the allireland final for a fifth successive year conveniently galvins suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against tyrone while he did not start the game he came on as a substitute an exciting game developed one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years the sides were level seven times before colm cooper nudged kerry – to – ahead before the interval tyrone simply wore kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from tommy mcguigan and a string of late points inspired tyrone to their third allireland title of the decade  saw galvin return to the halfforward line for kerrys opening munster semifinal meeting with cork that game ended in a draw however kerry were well beaten in the replay the kingdom were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over longford sligo and antrim galvin and his squad later lined out in the allireland quarterfinal and thrashed dublin before overcoming meath in a disappointing semifinal for the second year inarow kerry faced cork in the allireland final surprisingly the men from the kingdom went into the game as slight underdogs this tag appeared to be justified when galvins side trailed by – to – early in the opening half the kerry team stuck to their gameplan while cork recorded fourteen wides and at the final whistle kerry were the champions again by – to – it was galvins fourth allireland medal he subsequently won an allstar and the footballer of the year award in june  galvin was given an eightweek

nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally however after a period of extratime finuge regained the title on a score line of – to – another provincial decider beckoned for galvins side with cork champions aghabullogue providing the opposition the game was an exciting but onesided affair and galvin picked up a second munster junior winners medal after a – to – victory on this

to prominence on the intercounty scene as a member of the kerry minor football team in the late s he lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in  with limerick providing the opposition the game was a huge triumph for the kingdom as galvins side won by – to – it was his first munster winners medal at minor level kerry were later defeated in the subsequent allireland semifinal the same year he won an allireland vocational schools championship with the kerry vocational schools team following victory over tyrone in the final galvins performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the kerry under team in  the provincial decider that year pitted kerry against archrivals cork a close game developed however after the sixty minutes kerry were the champions by – to – it was galvins only munster under winners medal an allireland final appearance followed for galvin with westmeath providing the opposition kerry were the favourites going into the game however the leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers a narrow – to – score line resulted in defeat for galvins side galvin continued to play for the kerry under team for another two seasons however he enjoyed little further success senioredit galvin first played at intercounty senior level for kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late s he made a number of appearances with the team during the nhl during this time galvin joined the kerry senior football team in the early s however he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen in  he renewed his rivalry with limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider a – to – victory gave galvin a first munster winners medal in the senior grade after an exciting game with roscommon kerry advanced to an allireland semifinal meeting with tyrone after being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match the whole team struggled and kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new blanket defence that was introduced by teams like armagh and perfected by tyrone many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like ó sé and colm cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness a humiliating – to – defeat saw tyrone advance to the allireland final while kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship  saw galvin become an integral part of the kerry team the year began well with kerry reaching the final of the national league an exciting – to – victory saw kerry claim the title and galvin picked up a first national football league winners medal kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and for the second year in succession limerick were the opponents surprisingly that game ended in a – apiece draw the replay was also a closerun affair however kerry never really looked in danger of losing a – to – victory gave galvin a second munster winners medal the allireland series proved no difficulty for kerry and the kingdom booked their place in the allireland final against mayo an early goal from alan dillon gave the connacht men some hope however the game was effectively over after twentyfive minutes when colm cooper scored kerrys only goal of the day the points kept coming from galvins team and an injurytime michael conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for mayo a – to – victory gave galvin an allireland winners medal galvin was later presented with his first allstar the th award since the scheme began in  in  kerry were hot favourites to retain their allireland title all was going to plan as galvins side reached yet another provincial final in a return to tradition cork were the opponents a close game developed however in the end kerry were the narrow winners by – to – it was galvins third consecutive munster winners medal following this win kerry cruised through the allireland series to reach another championship decider with tyrone providing the opposition in one of the great finals of the decade the result remained in doubt until the final whistle dara ó cinnéide powered kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes tyrone responded in kind with a peter canavan goal just before halftime tomás ó sé launched the kerry comeback in the th minute with kerrys second goal however it was too later tyrone hung on to win by – to – it was galvins first defeat in an allireland final in  kerry reached the final of the national league and played galway galvins side could only manage three points in the opening half however the introduction of eoin brosnan transformed the team at the end of the seventy minutes a – to – score line gave kerry their th national league title and a second for galvin the league win was a false dawn as kerry went out tamely to cork in a replay of the munster final the team however bounced back against longford to set up a meeting with armagh in the allireland quarterfinal at halftime it looked as though the ulser hoodoo would strike again but kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of – to – the game was not without incident as galvin was redcarded for an altercation with the armagh water carrier kerry again beat cork in the subsequent semifinal before lining out against mayo in the allireland final an unbelievable opening firsthalf saw kerry go – to no score ahead after just ten minutes courtesy of goals by declan osullivan and kieran donaghy colm cooper slotted a third kerry goal however mayo settled and reduced the deficit to – to – at halftime the second thirtyfive minutes saw kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points a final score of – to – gave kerry another allireland title and gave galvin a second allireland winners medal galvin finished off the year with a second allstar award  saw kerry face cork in the provincial decider once again a close game developed however at the fulltime whsitle kerry were the champions by – to – it was ó galvins fourth munster winners medal kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their allireland quarterfinal against monaghan setting up a glamour allireland semifinal tie with dublin kerry saw off a great dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points the subsequent allireland final was an historic occasion as kerry faced cork in the very first allmunster championship decider while the first half was played on an even keel the kingdom ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued cork goalkeeper alan quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals at the fulltime whistle cork were trounced by – to – it was a third allireland medal for galvin and the first completion of backtoback allireland titles since cork in  and  in  galvin was appointed captain of the kerry team it was a great honour  what should have been a dream season for the finuge man particularly since kerry were attempting to capture a first threeinarow of allireland titles since  the kingdoms championship opener against clare was a dark moment for galvin the game was a largely lowkey affair except for one controversial incident between referee paddy russell and galvin russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of russells hand galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card the incident has been described as due to the frustration he felt at being booked for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his clare marker galvin received a sixmonth suspension however this was later reduced to twelve weeks it looked at this stage that galvins dream season was in tatters kerry drove on without him and reached the allireland final for a fifth successive year conveniently galvins suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against tyrone while he did not start the game he came on as a substitute an exciting game developed one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years the sides were level seven times before colm cooper nudged kerry – to – ahead before the interval tyrone simply wore kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from tommy mcguigan and a string of late points inspired tyrone to their third allireland title of the decade  saw galvin return to the halfforward line for kerrys opening munster semifinal meeting with cork that game ended in a draw however kerry were well beaten in the replay the kingdom were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over longford sligo and antrim galvin and his squad later lined out in the allireland quarterfinal and thrashed dublin before overcoming meath in a disappointing semifinal for the second year inarow kerry faced cork in the allireland final surprisingly the men from the kingdom went into the game as slight underdogs this tag appeared to be justified when galvins side trailed by – to – early in the opening half the kerry team stuck to their gameplan while cork recorded fourteen wides and at the final whistle kerry were the champions again by – to – it was galvins fourth allireland medal he subsequently won an allstar and the footballer of the year award in june  galvin was given an eightweek ban after the  munster senior football championship semifinal replay win

nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally however after a period of extratime finuge regained the title on a score line of – to – another provincial decider beckoned for galvins side with cork champions aghabullogue providing the opposition the game was an exciting but onesided affair and galvin picked up a second munster junior winners medal after a – to – victory on this

to prominence on the intercounty scene as a member of the kerry minor football team in the late s he lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in  with limerick providing the opposition the game was a huge triumph for the kingdom as galvins side won by – to – it was his first munster winners medal at minor level kerry were later defeated in the subsequent allireland semifinal the same year he won an allireland vocational schools championship with the kerry vocational schools team following victory over tyrone in the final galvins performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the kerry under team in  the provincial decider that year pitted kerry against archrivals cork a close game developed however after the sixty minutes kerry were the champions by – to – it was galvins only munster under winners medal an allireland final appearance followed for galvin with westmeath providing the opposition kerry were the favourites going into the game however the leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers a narrow – to – score line resulted in defeat for galvins side galvin continued to play for the kerry under team for another two seasons however he enjoyed little further success senioredit galvin first played at intercounty senior level for kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late s he made a number of appearances with the team during the nhl during this time galvin joined the kerry senior football team in the early s however he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen in  he renewed his rivalry with limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider a – to – victory gave galvin a first munster winners medal in the senior grade after an exciting game with roscommon kerry advanced to an allireland semifinal meeting with tyrone after being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match the whole team struggled and kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new blanket defence that was introduced by teams like armagh and perfected by tyrone many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like ó sé and colm cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness a humiliating – to – defeat saw tyrone advance to the allireland final while kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship  saw galvin become an integral part of the kerry team the year began well with kerry reaching the final of the national league an exciting – to – victory saw kerry claim the title and galvin picked up a first national football league winners medal kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and for the second year in succession limerick were the opponents surprisingly that game ended in a – apiece draw the replay was also a closerun affair however kerry never really looked in danger of losing a – to – victory gave galvin a second munster winners medal the allireland series proved no difficulty for kerry and the kingdom booked their place in the allireland final against mayo an early goal from alan dillon gave the connacht men some hope however the game was effectively over after twentyfive minutes when colm cooper scored kerrys only goal of the day the points kept coming from galvins team and an injurytime michael conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for mayo a – to – victory gave galvin an allireland winners medal galvin was later presented with his first allstar the th award since the scheme began in  in  kerry were hot favourites to retain their allireland title all was going to plan as galvins side reached yet another provincial final in a return to tradition cork were the opponents a close game developed however in the end kerry were the narrow winners by – to – it was galvins third consecutive munster winners medal following this win kerry cruised through the allireland series to reach another championship decider with tyrone providing the opposition in one of the great finals of the decade the result remained in doubt until the final whistle dara ó cinnéide powered kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes tyrone responded in kind with a peter canavan goal just before halftime tomás ó sé launched the kerry comeback in the th minute with kerrys second goal however it was too later tyrone hung on to win by – to – it was galvins first defeat in an allireland final in  kerry reached the final of the national league and played galway galvins side could only manage three points in the opening half however the introduction of eoin brosnan transformed the team at the end of the seventy minutes a – to – score line gave kerry their th national league title and a second for galvin the league win was a false dawn as kerry went out tamely to cork in a replay of the munster final the team however bounced back against longford to set up a meeting with armagh in the allireland quarterfinal at halftime it looked as though the ulser hoodoo would strike again but kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of – to – the game was not without incident as galvin was redcarded for an altercation with the armagh water carrier kerry again beat cork in the subsequent semifinal before lining out against mayo in the allireland final an unbelievable opening firsthalf saw kerry go – to no score ahead after just ten minutes courtesy of goals by declan osullivan and kieran donaghy colm cooper slotted a third kerry goal however mayo settled and reduced the deficit to – to – at halftime the second thirtyfive minutes saw kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points a final score of – to – gave kerry another allireland title and gave galvin a second allireland winners medal galvin finished off the year with a second allstar award  saw kerry face cork in the provincial decider once again a close game developed however at the fulltime whsitle kerry were the champions by – to – it was ó galvins fourth munster winners medal kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their allireland quarterfinal against monaghan setting up a glamour allireland semifinal tie with dublin kerry saw off a great dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points the subsequent allireland final was an historic occasion as kerry faced cork in the very first allmunster championship decider while the first half was played on an even keel the kingdom ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued cork goalkeeper alan quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals at the fulltime whistle cork were trounced by – to – it was a third allireland medal for galvin and the first completion of backtoback allireland titles since cork in  and  in  galvin was appointed captain of the kerry team it was a great honour  what should have been a dream season for the finuge man particularly since kerry were attempting to capture a first threeinarow of allireland titles since  the kingdoms championship opener against clare was a dark moment for galvin the game was a largely lowkey affair except for one controversial incident between referee paddy russell and galvin russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of russells hand galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card the incident has been described as due to the frustration he felt at being booked for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his clare marker galvin received a sixmonth suspension however this was later reduced to twelve weeks it looked at this stage that galvins dream season was in tatters kerry drove on without him and reached the allireland final for a fifth successive year conveniently galvins suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against tyrone while he did not start the game he came on as a substitute an exciting game developed one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years the sides were level seven times before colm cooper nudged kerry – to – ahead before the interval tyrone simply wore kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from tommy mcguigan and a string of late points inspired tyrone to their third allireland title of the decade  saw galvin return to the halfforward line for kerrys opening munster semifinal meeting with cork that game ended in a draw however kerry were well beaten in the replay the kingdom were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over longford sligo and antrim galvin and his squad later lined out in the allireland quarterfinal and thrashed dublin before overcoming meath in a disappointing semifinal for the second year inarow kerry faced cork in the allireland final surprisingly the men from the kingdom went into the game as slight underdogs this tag appeared to be justified when galvins side trailed by – to – early in the opening half the kerry team stuck to their gameplan while cork recorded fourteen wides and at the final whistle kerry were the champions again by – to – it was galvins fourth allireland medal he subsequently won an allstar and the footballer of the year award in june  galvin was given an eightweek ban after the  munster senior football championship semifinal replay win

nearly kicked the match away with an enormous wides tally however after a period of extratime finuge regained the title on a score line of – to – another provincial decider beckoned for galvins side with cork champions aghabullogue providing the opposition the game was an exciting but onesided affair and galvin picked up a second munster junior winners medal after a – to – victory on this occasion the kerry side went all the way to the allireland final where stewartstown harps of tyrone were waiting galvin gave an outstanding display in that game and the northerners were easily brushed

from finuge to st vincents in dublin but his club teammate and former member of the kerry management team éamonn fitzmaurice rubbished those reports via twitter minor and underedit galvin first came to prominence on the intercounty scene as a member of the kerry minor football team in the late s he lined out in his only provincial decider in that grade in  with limerick providing the opposition the game was a huge triumph for the kingdom as galvins side won by – to – it was his first munster winners medal at minor level kerry were later defeated in the subsequent allireland semifinal the same year he won an allireland vocational schools championship with the kerry vocational schools team following victory over tyrone in the final galvins performances at minor level made him an automatic choice for the kerry under team in  the provincial decider that year pitted kerry against archrivals cork a close game developed however after the sixty minutes kerry were the champions by – to – it was galvins only munster under winners medal an allireland final appearance followed for galvin with westmeath providing the opposition kerry were the favourites going into the game however the leinster minnows proved that they were no pushovers a narrow – to – score line resulted in defeat for galvins side galvin continued to play for the kerry under team for another two seasons however he enjoyed little further success senioredit galvin first played at intercounty senior level for kerry not with the footballers but the hurlers in the late s he made a number of appearances with the team during the nhl during this time galvin joined the kerry senior football team in the early s however he had to wait for a number of years before establishing himself on the starting fifteen in  he renewed his rivalry with limerick when he came on as a substitute in the provincial decider a – to – victory gave galvin a first munster winners medal in the senior grade after an exciting game with roscommon kerry advanced to an allireland semifinal meeting with tyrone after being shocked in the latter stages of the two previous championships kerry were out to atone and were favourites going into the match the whole team struggled and kerry looked like they were going to be left behind with the new blanket defence that was introduced by teams like armagh and perfected by tyrone many criticised this tactic as a means of stopping talented footballers like ó sé and colm cooper from playing but few could deny its effectiveness a humiliating – to – defeat saw tyrone advance to the allireland final while kerry were unceremoniously dumped out of the championship  saw galvin become an integral part of the kerry team the year began well with kerry reaching the final of the national league an exciting – to – victory saw kerry claim the title and galvin picked up a first national football league winners medal kerry later booked their almost annual spot in the provincial final and for the second year in succession limerick were the opponents surprisingly that game ended in a – apiece draw the replay was also a closerun affair however kerry never really looked in danger of losing a – to – victory gave galvin a second munster winners medal the allireland series proved no difficulty for kerry and the kingdom booked their place in the allireland final against mayo an early goal from alan dillon gave the connacht men some hope however the game was effectively over after twentyfive minutes when colm cooper scored kerrys only goal of the day the points kept coming from galvins team and an injurytime michael conroy goal was nothing but a consolation for mayo a – to – victory gave galvin an allireland winners medal galvin was later presented with his first allstar the th award since the scheme began in  in  kerry were hot favourites to retain their allireland title all was going to plan as galvins side reached yet another provincial final in a return to tradition cork were the opponents a close game developed however in the end kerry were the narrow winners by – to – it was galvins third consecutive munster winners medal following this win kerry cruised through the allireland series to reach another championship decider with tyrone providing the opposition in one of the great finals of the decade the result remained in doubt until the final whistle dara ó cinnéide powered kerry ahead with a goal after just six minutes tyrone responded in kind with a peter canavan goal just before halftime tomás ó sé launched the kerry comeback in the th minute with kerrys second goal however it was too later tyrone hung on to win by – to – it was galvins first defeat in an allireland final in  kerry reached the final of the national league and played galway galvins side could only manage three points in the opening half however the introduction of eoin brosnan transformed the team at the end of the seventy minutes a – to – score line gave kerry their th national league title and a second for galvin the league win was a false dawn as kerry went out tamely to cork in a replay of the munster final the team however bounced back against longford to set up a meeting with armagh in the allireland quarterfinal at halftime it looked as though the ulser hoodoo would strike again but kerry blitzed the men from the orchard county in the second half and won by a score of – to – the game was not without incident as galvin was redcarded for an altercation with the armagh water carrier kerry again beat cork in the subsequent semifinal before lining out against mayo in the allireland final an unbelievable opening firsthalf saw kerry go – to no score ahead after just ten minutes courtesy of goals by declan osullivan and kieran donaghy colm cooper slotted a third kerry goal however mayo settled and reduced the deficit to – to – at halftime the second thirtyfive minutes saw kerry run riot while the westerners could only muster three points a final score of – to – gave kerry another allireland title and gave galvin a second allireland winners medal galvin finished off the year with a second allstar award  saw kerry face cork in the provincial decider once again a close game developed however at the fulltime whsitle kerry were the champions by – to – it was ó galvins fourth munster winners medal kerry then had the narrowest of victories in their allireland quarterfinal against monaghan setting up a glamour allireland semifinal tie with dublin kerry saw off a great dublin comeback in the second half to win by two points the subsequent allireland final was an historic occasion as kerry faced cork in the very first allmunster championship decider while the first half was played on an even keel the kingdom ran riot in the second half and a rout ensued cork goalkeeper alan quirke came in for much criticism after conceding some easy goals at the fulltime whistle cork were trounced by – to – it was a third allireland medal for galvin and the first completion of backtoback allireland titles since cork in  and  in  galvin was appointed captain of the kerry team it was a great honour  what should have been a dream season for the finuge man particularly since kerry were attempting to capture a first threeinarow of allireland titles since  the kingdoms championship opener against clare was a dark moment for galvin the game was a largely lowkey affair except for one controversial incident between referee paddy russell and galvin russell was attempting to book the team captain when he slapped the notebook out of russells hand galvin then remonstrated with the linesman who had recommended his second yellow card the incident has been described as due to the frustration he felt at being booked for highlighting to the linesman the blatant and protracted pulling and dragging he was subjected to off the ball by his clare marker galvin received a sixmonth suspension however this was later reduced to twelve weeks it looked at this stage that galvins dream season was in tatters kerry drove on without him and reached the allireland final for a fifth successive year conveniently galvins suspension ended on the day of the championship decider against tyrone while he did not start the game he came on as a substitute an exciting game developed one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years the sides were level seven times before colm cooper nudged kerry – to – ahead before the interval tyrone simply wore kerry into the ground in the second half as a priceless goal from tommy mcguigan and a string of late points inspired tyrone to their third allireland title of the decade  saw galvin return to the halfforward line for kerrys opening munster semifinal meeting with cork that game ended in a draw however kerry were well beaten in the replay the kingdom were subsequently banished to the qualifiers where they had some unimpressive wins over longford sligo and antrim galvin and his squad later lined out in the allireland quarterfinal and thrashed dublin before overcoming meath in a disappointing semifinal for the second year inarow kerry faced cork in the allireland final surprisingly the men from the kingdom went into the game as slight underdogs this tag appeared to be justified when galvins side trailed by – to – early in the opening half the kerry team stuck to their gameplan while cork recorded fourteen wides and at the final whistle kerry were the champions again by – to – it was galvins fourth allireland medal he subsequently won an allstar and the footballer of the year award in june  galvin was given an eightweek ban after the  munster senior football championship semifinal replay win over cork the gaas central competitions control committee proposed the suspension after reviewing video evidence of galvin putting his finger into eoin cadogans mouth on  february  galvin unexpectedly

vivian marino april   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo credit andrea mohinthe new york times mr galvin  is the chairman chief executive and a founder of sg blocks a publicly traded company that repurposes maritimegrade steel cargo shipping containers into green building blocks for use in commercial industrial and residential building construction the containers are provided by conglobal industries a partnerthe company which was started in  is based in new yorkinterview conducted and condensed by vivian marinoq why did you start this companya i had gotten into real estate development through a charity that i cofounded and was involved in running and we were developing housing programs for individuals and families with aids so we had to figure out a way to give them continuum care — we had to get good at real estate and we started to develop affordable housingif you’ve ever done any development in new york you know that the construction process is not always as predictable as you would like and so i saw this as a way to create a sustainable alternative in the marketplace and eliminate some of the risk of sitebase construction continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q where did you do work for the charitya throughout brooklyn and the bronxq have you thought about reaching out to mayor bill de blasio’s office about providing affordable housing alternatives using these containersa yeah the marketplace seems to be heading toward smallerfootprint living and working spaces particularly for millennials who are coming into the economy and having a rough time of it we think our product lends itself to those kinds of creative spaceswe worked with the last administration especially after sandy we actually had proposed providing  or  temporary stores in impacted areas with a private sponsor but that never went offq you just finished a containerbased project in nashvillea yes that was a retail projectq you’re working with other partners including palladium management on a mixeduse multifamily project in new york a our product is engineered to go nine stories high so right now we’re vetting one site in particular very closely in manhattan for a mixeduse project advertisement continue reading the main story we think plus or minus the building will be somewhere around  to  square feet we don’t make one container an apartment — maybe we’ll engineer four or five to create four apartments and we take out the side walls to facilitate thatthat building will probably be one floor commercial and seven apartments a few of which will be duplexeswe have a letter of intent signed and partnership documents are being finalized it would be a partnership with the landowner i’m under an agreement i can’t say who newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please reenter you

assuming everything is finalized as planned when would you like to see the project completeda we’d like to have the building delivered by late fall of this yearq that’s pretty fasta we’re doing a restaurant today — do you know bareburger — in oyster bay cove it’s an container restaurant so around  square feet we just did the first seven containers between  o’clock and  o’clock today and then tomorrow morning the last four will come and the building will be closed in a day and a halfq how strong are these container foundationsa the containers are originally engineered to a very strict criteria — it’s called a convention for safe containers so that sounds boring and it is but every container in the world has to be built to that specification because they selfcenter and lock when they’re at seaq and they meet all of the requirements from the buildings department a we meet or exceed all of the structural codes and we have spent the better part of our existence getting permitted and approved in the biggest cities and the biggest jurisdictions as well as creating engineering tools that will help predict our building’s behavior in the built environmentjust to note that containers are  pounds they can hold up to  pounds of cargo so at sea that bottom container is holding up eight of its brothers and sisters that’s  pounds of load at the dynamic forces at sea it’s a highly oxidized steel and it’s engineered to be beaten up by saltwater at sea and to take a poundingq is it cheaper to build this waya i would say in manhattan and the tristate area definitely we quantify it in terms of economic impact we just don’t go on price we’re going to finish the construction in half the time so that all of your soft costs — construction interest builders risk site security building utilities — are going to be halved and in addition to saving all that money and time you’re getting your revenue in half the time so if a traditional build is  months and we open you in  you get a whole year of income advertisement continue reading the main story q how much do the containers costa a brand new one could be  and an older one could be  over time they could be a little more banged up or dented but we know which walls are coming out so we can buy containers where half the walls are all banged up because we know that wall is coming outq is it harder designing a structure using containers as the foundation a we’ve really approached this as an engineered building system every building system has some constrictions every product and every site works for containers i would say that within reason we’ve been able to date to create the structure and the space plan that the structure affords we’ve been able to successfully do that so fara building that would be say  percent curved wall glass on every side we would not recommend you use the containersq could you ever see yourself living in a containerbuilt homea i’m designing one for a second home as we speak i’m also looking at lots now according to my wife these are the finalists the hamptons the hamptons the hamptons and maybe the berkshiresit’s like midcentury modern architecture continue

of his friend “the jury convicted me of firstdegree murder but i don’t deserve to die” galvin said before judge paul m yatron formally imposed the death sentence “i want to thank my friends and family for their love and support” galvin said galvin did not testify during his trial which concluded aug  when a luzerne county jury imposed the death sentence the same jury had convicted galvin  of the  block of south th street of firstdegree murder for the killing of kristofer kolesnik  of  s th st galvin told his lawyers chief public defender glenn d welsh and assistant public defender timothy biltcliff not to present evidence during the penalty phase of the trial to convince the jury to spare his life death penalty cases are automatically appealed to the state supreme court “bryan galvin is a poster child for the death penalty” district attorney mark c baldwin said “i am confident that one day a governor will sign a death warrant for bryan galvin” kolesnik’s girlfriend wendy hess of reading wept as she told the judge that kolesnik’s life should never have been taken “justice needs to be served” hess said “his life was taken for no reason” yatron noted that there are few executions in pennsylvania “we have had about three death sentences carried out in  years” he said the last execution in pennsylvania occurred july   when gary heidnick received a lethal injection for
