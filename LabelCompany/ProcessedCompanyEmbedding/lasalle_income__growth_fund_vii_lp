how how can nextshares potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind
