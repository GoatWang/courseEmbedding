in our sec filings this conference call will be made available on our website or via phone replay approximately two hours after the end of this call now heres todd todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today as you saw in our earnings release first quarter consolidated net sales were  million a decrease of  million or approximately  from the same quarter last year as we had expected the strengthening of the us dollar had a significant impact on our yearoveryear sales in the first quarter net of offseting price increases the weakening of foreign currencies negatively impacted net sales by approximately  million in the first quarter excluding currency impacts net sales increased by  million or  this increase was driven by acquisitions we completed last year as well as a solid late season demand in our major lawn and garden markets particularly in the us the improved late season helped drive increased sales of small walk mower engines to oems as well as highend residential and commercial lawn and garden equipment through our north america dealer channel somewhat offsetting the increase were lower sales in certain international markets the consolidated adjusted net loss for the first quarter was  million an increase from the adjusted net loss of  million in the first quarter of fiscal  the adjusted net loss excludes restructuring charges and certain other charges as described in yesterday evenings earnings release the adjusted diluted loss per share for the quarter was  higher than last years adjusted diluted loss per share of  but beating our expectations the higher adjusted net loss for the quarter reflects several factors we discussed during our last quarterly conference call first production volumes were lower in our engines and products businesses last year we had accelerated manufacturing into the first quarter in order to build inventory to facilitate the closure of the mcdonough plant and to launch of our new exi engine second the strengthening of the us dollar had an unfavorable impact on adjusted net income of approximately  million third our pension plan expense increased by approximately  million related to the implementation of new mortality tables despite these anticipated headwinds in the first quarter we are very encouraged by the sustained improved profitability of our products business while we are not yet satisfied with the results the business continues to head in the right direction a large driver of the profitability improvement was the incremental restructuring savings as a result of closing the mcdonough plant a lot of hard work has gone into transitioning production to our wauwatosa wisconsin and munnsville new york plants in september we began riding mower production in wauwatosa which was the final product line to be transitioned while there is more work to be done to complete the project we are very pleased with the early results i would like to thank all of our employees who made this possible through their great efforts in conjunction with rightsizing the footprint and related cost structure of the products business we have been focusing on selling highermargin products the addition of billy goats specialty turf care products which are geared toward the professional landscape rental  markets played a part in improving our products segment margins in the first quarter similar to our ferris commercial cutting equipment sales of billy goat equipment benefited from the strong late season the integration of billy goat is proceeding very well the innovation that the billy goat team launched this fall is outstanding we have even more in the pipeline which fits very well with the innovation culture of our company i would like to thank our team for the hard work that is allowing billy goat to become a key part of briggs  stratton it was a year ago in the first quarter that we entered the job site products category with our acquisition of allmand brothers at the time a large portion of allmands business sold into the domestic oil and gas industry with the significant decline in oil prices over the past year to below  per barrel capital spending of domestic oil and gas companies has reduced considerably while this headwind has had the nearterm impact of reducing allmands sales and profitability we continue to be impressed by the strength of the allmand brand and the longterm opportunity presented by the jobsite category we have been working diligently this past year to further diversify allmands sales into domestic construction and infrastructure markets as well as in the many of the international markets which briggs  stratt has served for many years in addition this past quarter we added a new portable heater product line to our allmand branded portfolio through a small asset acquisition this new product line offers a flameless heating solution to improve safety in the job site and helps expand our allmand product offering now ill turn it back over to mark to walk through our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal  mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president thanks todd as todd noted our first quarter consolidated net sales were  million sic  million  a decrease of approximately  million or  from consolidated net sales in the first quarter of last year first quarter consolidated net loss on a gaap basis of  million a decrease of  million from a gaap net loss of  million one year ago as a reminder we typically report a net loss on our first fiscal quarter due to the seasonal nature of our engines business and the related lawn and garden portion of our products business in the first quarter we incurred restructuring charges of  million pretax related to executing the restructuring actions we announced last year with respect to narrowing our lower margin snapper product lineup and closing our mcdonough georgia facility within our products segment in addition we incurred approximately  of purchase accounting charges in the first quarter of  related to the acquisition of billy goat this past may we also incurred approximately  million of restructuring charges on our engines segment these charges were related to our reduction in force at our plant in chongqing china to offset lower production of engines used in snow throwers and certain changes to certain salary positions in the us the engines segment also incurred an  litigation settlement charge in the first quarter excluding these restructuring purchase accounting and litigation expenses the adjusted net loss for the first quarter was  million or  an increase from the adjusted net loss of  million or  per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal  engines segment sales for the first quarter were  million a decrease of  million or  compared to the prior year unfavorable foreign currency net of offsetting price increases negatively impacted sales by approximately  million largely due to the weakening of the euro total engine unit shipments were higher than last year by approximately  this was largely due to higher shipments of small engines used on walk mowers due to the improved lawn and garden markets in north america and europe this past season partially offsetting the increase were reduced shipments of engines we used in snow throwers due to adequate channel inventories in europe as well as lower placement in north america sales of engines used in our pressure washers were also lower as last year at this time we were building pressure washer inventory in order to facilitate the closure of the mcdonough plant following the solid late season sales we believe that channel inventories of lawn and garden equipment are at a normal level heading into the fall and winter seasons for the first quarter the engines adjusted segment loss was  million a decrease of  million from the adjusted engines segment loss last year of  million the engines segment adjusted gross profit rate was  a basispoint decrease from  in the prior year the gross profit rate decreased by  basis points due to unfavorable foreign currencies particularly the weakening of the euro units produced in the quarter decreased by  to approximately  million units as todd mentioned last year we increased first quarter engine production to have adequate inventories in advance of changing over to our new exi small engine platform and to support the closure of the mcdonough plant total engine inventories at the end of the quarter were approximately  million units which is a decrease of approximately  units compared to the end of the first quarter of  we continue to anticipate that fiscal  yearend inventory will be slightly lower than fiscal  yearend inventories partially offsetting the reduced gross margin rate was the benefit of improved plan efficiencies and slightly lower material costs engines segment esga had a modest increase in the first quarter of  due to higher pension costs offset by the benefit of weaker foreign currency rates in the products segment sales for the first quarter were  million a decrease of approximately  million or  from the prior year unfavorable foreign currency net of offsetting price increases negatively impacted net sales by approximately  million primarily related to the weakening of the australian dollar and brazilian real excluding currencies products net sales increased by  million or a little over  this increase was primarily driven by higher sales of lawn and garden equipment to our north america dealer channel and the result of acquisitions we completed in fiscal  particularly billy goat which we acquired in the fourth quarter of last year we owned allmand for roughly  days of the first quarter last year during a time period when the oil and gas sector was more robust partially offsetting the increase in net sales were lower shipments of snow throwers into europe following two seasons of belowaverage snowfall as well as lower sales overall in latin america due to economic instability in the region sales were also lower due to reduced sales of generator as the market continues to decline given no major power outages in the us over the last few years our planned actions to narrow the assortment of lowerpriced snapper consumer lawn and garden equipment also resulted in lower sales inventory of lawn and garden equipment in the dealer channel is consistent with last year we have seen dealers in north america stocking up for the snow season after their inventories were largely sold through during last winter here in the us in europe we believe the channel inventories of snow throwers are adequate given relatively little snowfall in europe the last two seasons excluding pretax restructuring charges of  million and billy goat purchase accounting charges approximately  the products segment had adjusted segment income of  million in the quarter an increase of  million from the first quarter last year products segments adjusted gross profit margin of  increased by  basis points from the prior year the improvement in gross profit was related to incremental restructuring cost savings and improved manufacturing efficiency which contributed  basis points favorable sales mix also drove higher gross profit margins as we continue to on focus selling highermargin products through the dealer channel and the addition of billy goat partially offsetting the improved gross margins was a basispoint headwind due to lower production levels in the prior year we had accelerated production in the first quarter to facilitate moving production from the mcdonough plant to wauwatosa products segment esga expenses increased slightly in the first quarter of  due to the esga associated with the allmand and billy goat acquisitions partially offset by the benefit of the dollarforeign currency rates mainly in australia and brazil turning to the balance sheet net debt at the end of the first fiscal quarter was approximately  million an increase of approximately  million from the first quarter of fiscal  the majority of the increase was due to cash used to purchase billy goat in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as slightly higher additions to plant and equipment the end of the quarter we had  million drawn on our  million revolving credit facility cash used in operating activities for the quarter was  million primarily related to seasonal build of inventory levels and reduction of accounts receivable in the quarter last month cash provided by operating activities was  million and last month free cash flow was approximately  million depreciation for the quarter of  million was consistent with capital expenditures for the quarter last month average leverage and last month ebitda as defined by our credit agreement in place at the end of the quarter were  million and  million respectively resulting in a leverage ratio of  times which is well within our covenants that concludes what we wanted to say about the first quarter financial results so ill turn it back to todd for his concluding remarks todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer well our first quarter results were better than our expectations as we said earlier our first quarter is typically our lowest in terms of sales and profitability due to the seasonal nature of our business normal levels of lawn and garden channel inventory this time of year are encouraging for the upcoming season however we are increasingly cautious about the global economy and its potential impact of further weakening foreign currencies and continued weakness in the oil and gas market for these reasons we are reaffirming our fiscal year  projections for net income to be in the range of  million to  million or  to  per diluted share prior to the impact of any share repurchase activity and costs related to our announced restructuring programs our fiscal  forecast contemplates the us and european lawn and garden markets being higher by  to  assuming a normal start to the selling season as a reminder our second quarter sales tend to be slightly more weighted toward international regions and therefore we are more exposed to currency headwinds in this quarter discussions with our customers regarding product lineups for the  spring and summer selling season are wrapping up in the coming weeks and we will be in a position to provide an update on placement for next season during our fiscal  second quarter conference call in january consolidated operating margins are forecasted to be in the range of  to  interest expense which is projected to be approximately  million is increased from fiscal  due to expected higher seasonal borrowing levels in fiscal  that concludes our prepared comments and now i would like to open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator and our first question comes from tim wojs from baird your line is now open tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker hey guys good morning todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer good morning mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president good morning tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker i guess just to start todd could you talk a little bit just about how the quarter progressed according to the plan and what you thought heading into the quarter and then just some of the late shipments in engines that you saw i mean would you characterize that as maybe gaining a little bit of share or was that just kind of typical reorder just because of inventory and then how do you guys just on the inventory piece how – would you consider – weve been in a pretty abnormal environment the last four years or five years so im just curious how you define normal right now todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer so let me start with kind of how the quarter progressed and try to go through the different aspects of your question if i miss anything let me know tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker yes i put like three of them in there todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer thats okay yes the quarter progressed – as you kind of look through the quarter it was a little bit slow early on in july and august and that – especially here in the us and in europe because the weather was a bit dryer and so we started to see a bit of a slowdown if you will in shipments julyaugust once we got in september we started to see improved weather here in the us across the country as well as over in europe and we did see then an uptick with regards to lawn mowers and commercial mowers especially it continued very strong than in – through the month of september so when you kind of – when you look at that that was a little bit better than netnet to where we thought it was going to be we knew that there were going to be some headwinds as it related to the currencies and the pension and the other things that we had talked about so all in all the way the quarter ended up it was better than what we had anticipated now when you go to the inventory levels – so in terms of a share pickup or anything like that i would tell you that it was – our share was our share throughout the season and because the market seemed to pick up here a little bit later on thats where we started to see a few more sales into the oems i would not characterize that as share gain i would characterize that as they continue to produce to supply then as needed to the retailers with regards to whats normal anymore in inventories youre right we have been through about four abnormal years simply because we had the drought going all the way back to  and that has a couple of year impact i would tell you as we look at inventories historically we think that theyre pretty normal and when we say historical we go well beyond the last four years and so when you look at inventories where they would have been coming out of a drought year for example coming out of the year after the drought for example theyre lower we believe theyre lower we dont have full visibility throughout the channel but based on what we know we believe that they are lower than they would have been the last few years and approaching levels as to where they would have been say six years seven years eight years ago on a little longer term view so i would tell you that i think sequentially if you think about the yearoveryear certainly i think inventories are in a – we believe inventories are in a better position now than they would have been any time over the last say three years tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay thats helpful and has october been kind of a little bit better a little bit in line with expectations just curious how thats gone todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer yes things really start to slow down in october and so its one of those things where i wouldnt tell you that it seems to be pretty normal tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay okay and mark just two financial questions i guess one is it possible that engines margins could be flat to up this year im just curious how you think about the margins in that segment and then is it possible to tell us what the contribution from acquisitions was during the quarter mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president well in the engines margin front what we work on in improving margins is number one the new products weve come out with and attempting to achieve higher margin rates than the products that we replaced and we also work on efficiency gains in our plants and we always enter the year with a sizable amount of cost reduction takeout we want to have and so those are the upsides the challenge that we have as we came into the year mainly has to do with the foreign exchange rates which are a significant impact particularly as you look at the yearoveryear and its impact on our engine so you got to think about those things net together as you think about the overall profitability change in the engine business yearoveryear tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay okay and then the acquisitions mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president yes from an acquisitions we havent broken that out specifically however historically what weve commented on is that allmand has essentially  million in net sales and billy goat has approximately  million in net sales and so if you break that out doing the math that should get you in the neighborhood of what the impact is with a little bit of color that weve added here that we got some caution on the allmand business given its historic heavier weight to the oil and gas sector and its really important from a strategic perspective that we help diversify the revenue stream of that business into the construction and infrastructure markets as well as international to the extent – the speed of which we can diversify that will depend on whether we can maintain that approximate historical sales volume level as clearly oil and gas at  a barrel presents quite a headwind tim r wojs  robert w baird  co inc broker okay good ill jump back in the queue thanks guys todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from sam darkatsh from raymond james your line is open sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc good morning todd mark how are you todd j teske  chairman president  chief executive officer doing well sam how are you sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc im doing fine thank you just a couple of housekeeping questions and this one might end up being just a nuance im not sure in my notes i think dave last quarter mentioned expectations of operating margin for the year being up  basis points or  basis points and the guidance today is  to  which – have you changed the lower end of that operating margin based on the prior expectations or was i reading too much into daves comment last quarter mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president no we havent changed anything daves comments were more in context to the midpoint of our range there was a lot of our discussion around how we laid forth the outlook for next year but the  to  range is very much in line with the net income and eps guidance that we gave back in august now the additional factors of caution that we added this quarter was the continued impact of foreign exchange and some of the difficulties in the global markets particularly latin america and were keeping a close eye to see how those markets progress as we go throughout the year and then as i just mentioned oil and gas is clearly a challenge in our allmand business that we need to work against the other thing we added into the information was more information on interest expense which is going to be a little bit higher yearoveryear because of the acquisition levels we did last year as well as a little bit higher capital spend and were also projecting a little bit lower other income from our joint ventures as that just tends to vary year to year sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc thats very helpful thank you mark the second question i think you might have mentioned in your prepared remarks the inventory in units at the end of the quarter was – i think it was well it was down about  units if my math holds mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president  units sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc  units okay are you expecting that gap yearonyear to narrow by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year or remain around  units just trying to get a sense of production versus shipment plans between now and the end of the fiscal year mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president yes what we said was we intend to take out working capital of up to  million of the total company yearonyear as we come to the end of the fiscal year the other thing to keep in mind is we came into the year quite a bit lower inventorywise and then the impact in first quarter impacting inventory last year we were a little bit high as we are wrapping up launch the exi engine as well as the transition so indeed i think youre on the right track that last year inventory was a little bit high but i wouldnt tell you that its a oneforone as to how it will track through the rest of the year sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc i was just trying to get a sense since you came in better than plan in the first quarter whether that also adjusted your thinking around yearend inventories or production levels mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president not at this time sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc okay and then last question before ill defer to others can you quantify the impact on engine sales from the snow i think you were planning on  million to  million or so do you have a sense of what that impact was in the quarter mark a schwertfeger  chief financial officer  senior vice president no i dont have that real handy the snow tends to be a smaller part of our overall business though is the context i would provide to that sam j darkatsh  raymond james  associates inc yes got it thank you gentlemen i appreciate it operator thank you thank you and im showing no further questions from our phone lines mark a schwertfeger  chief financial
