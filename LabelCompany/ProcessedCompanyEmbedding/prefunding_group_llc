people living with sci approximately three million worldwide are affected because sci is so debilitating patients require extensive care and lifetime support estimates in the us alone indicate that more than  billion is spent annually to treat and care for affected individuals celvive researchers working on regenerative medicine approaches have developed a new method for treating patients with chronic sci using a patients own adult stem cells that are derived to enhance regeneration of spinal nerves through celvive technology has been developed to deliver bone marrow regenerating cells from the hips of sci patients by passing them through a sealed device and delivering the cells directly to the patients spinal cord the current focus of the company is to develop technology for the isolation and administration of different types of stem cells for neural regeneration in patients of sci and other regenerative medicine applications harnessing the regenerative power of adult stem cells celvive has very promising data with this therapy in large sci animal model studies which recently appeared in an advanced online peerreviewed publication and revealed that these stem cells homed to the injury site and resulted in neural regeneration and regaining of motor functions all without any observed side effects this led to initiate an overseas randomized controlled registered phase iii trial in humans including  chronic sci patients the trial has been completed was published and featured on the cover of the april  issue of the prestigious peerreviewed regenerative medicine journal cell transplantation data from these studies indicate the safety and efficacy of celvives therapeutic approach for the first time in a large regulated clinical trial adult bmderived stem cells allowed chronic paralyzed sci patients to regain sensory functions and some abilities to walk in addition celvive has partnered with a usbased fdaapproved manufacturer to produce the stemcure™ cell isolation and delivery system which has been tested to prepare for an ind application with the fda for the second phase of clinical studies in the us celvive plans to quickly advance to a point where it can embark on multicenter clinical trials in north america europe and india further development will permit using this technology to isolate and deliver stem cells for multiple regenerative

from neurodegenerative illnesses such as alzheimers ad and parkinsons disease pd and considering our aging population the number of people who will develop these devastating and debilitating diseases is expected to increase dramatically in the future unfortunately at this time there are no definitive methods to detect these conditions before significant and irreversible brain damage has occurred durin technologies inc is developing diagnostic kits to detect identify and stage neurodegenerative diseases in patients long before physical symptoms become pronounced the companys technology which monitors the bodys response to illness requires only a single drop of blood and can be performed as part of an individuals annual physical examination durin focuses its research on the identification and potential utility of monitoring autoantibodies formed by the patients immune system during disease progression a concept steadily gaining support in the scientific community since different medical conditions result in damage to certain organs or parts of organs autoantibodies that specifically bind to only those tissues are formed sometimes years in advance of the appearance of physical symptoms these autoantibodies can be used therefore to design highly effective diagnostic methodologies durin has completed research into the design of its diagnostics and is presently assembling its first prototype diagnostic kit for more information contact mike wiley vice president foundation venture capital group at   or mwileynjhforg geneassess inc is dedicated to developing its breakthrough discovery of the fry gene as a predictive biomarker for breast and other cancers the company will use proprietary antibodies to validate loss of the fry protein as a cancer biomarker using targeted genomic sequencing to detect genetic mutations in fry associated highrisk populations and explore target validation for fry the signature gene could provide a more accurate diagnostic biomarker for cancer staging mutations in the gene increase rat susceptibility to mammary cancer and fry reduced the growth of highly aggressive human breast cancer cells fry could potentially be used as a platform to develop cancer genebased susceptibility tests for disease progression and for tumor grading this tumor suppressor gene could also be useful for developing new targeted drugs especially for the treatment of aggressive andor advanced cancers originating from many tissue types the geneassess research team found that rats carrying a mutant fry gene are highly susceptible to mammary carcinogenesis expressing fry in human breast cancer cells prevented tumor growth in nude mice reduced fry expression in many cancer types is associated with more aggressive growth and predicts poor clinical outcomes geneassess is currently validating these results with clinical samples from cancer patients and examining frys correlation and association with these samples for diagnostics and outcome predictions for more information visit geneassess’s web site or contact mike wiley vice president foundation venture capital group at   or mwileynjhforg longevica pharmaceuticals inc is a privately held healthrelated technology company that is developing novel proprietary drugs with potential use in the treatment of cancer degenerative diseases and agerelated disorders the company was formed primarily to commercialize the discoveries demonstrating that inactivation of an alpha kinase ef kinase protects normal noncancer cells and tissues from the toxic effect of chemotherapy or radiation treatments despite the tremendous progress in drug cancer chemotherapy most of the drugs used today have a pronounced toxicity effect killing normal cells along with cancer cells the work being done by scientists at longevica may lead to a novel approach in cancer therapy that can significantly improve the efficiency of the current methods of cancer treatment the discoveries are also expected to be helpful in treating patients suffering from ischemia stroke and neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimers disease by protecting cells and tissues from stress damage foundation venture capital group sold its equity interest in longevica to rostock international ltd a subsidiary of rostock group a moscow russia headquartered global investment firm focused on investments in

dyskinesia in patients with parkinsons disease this chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder affects one million people in the united states and seven million worldwide while ldopa is effective in ameliorating disease symptoms particularly in its early stages the vast majority of patients taking it chronically eventually develop ldopa induced dyskinesia lid abnormal involuntary movements that can be disabling currently the medical management of these complications is a major unmet need for this patient population based on proofofconcept preclinical studies indicating robust efficacy and favorable safety profile the company is now advancing to conduct a clinical trial testing the efficacy of this new treatment mentinovas strategy is to use a drug that is currently clinically approved for another indication and repurpose it for the treatment of ldopa induced dyskinesia in parkinsons disease patients this path can provide a critically needed medication in a rapid timeframe additional therapeutic area opportunities exist for this drug that can also provide indications in other disease targets characterized by abnormal involuntary movements such as huntingtons disease
