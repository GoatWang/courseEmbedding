category overview and then we’ll discuss our key initiatives our cfo steve kinsey will follow with greater detail on the first quarter results as well as provide our current outlook for fiscal  then we’ll open up the call to your questions when we consider the broader trends in the packaged foods we are seeing multiple factors applied they reflect changing consumer taste and preference in short brands that deliver innovation and unique products were the point of difference of growing sales in the bakery category the marketplace remains highly competitive as retailers and bakers finds a balance between improving margins and building market share we believe flowers is well positioned to navigate in this challenging environment we know where to focus our attention in order to drive sustainable profitable earnings growth and create value for our shareholders for example we see opportunities to improve our return on trade investment and so we are in the process of rationalizing our product assortment and investing in tools to better manage our promotional spend the following shelf resets ph will reflect elements of our streamline assortment and we expect our improved promotional management tools to be online in early  also our priority is to better align our nature’s own brand which is a number one brand in the bread category with the growing number of millennial families through research and integration we are working to enhance the brand’s consumer appeal already underway our efforts to improve the efficiency of our bakeries we are scrutinizing cost and enhancing processes in order to improve productivity and product quality importantly and as we will discuss in more detail we are also building capabilities to drive innovation and better anticipate and respond to changing trends through project centennial looking more closely at the category in line with broader food trends the fresh packaged breads category was down  this quarter the growth segments during the quarter were white loaf organic breads and dinner breads excluding the divestiture our reported sales declined  we did outperform the category with shared gains in the white loaf soft variety buns and rolls and specialty premium segments organic breads drove our sales this quarter and i’ll touch on that more in just a minute the bread and commercial cake categories continue to be challenging sales of soft variety and nonorganic white pan ph breads in particular have been impacted by consumer trends and competitive activities the cake category was down  basis points in the first quarter a positive as our share of the category has been stable for the past two quarters after being under pressure during the reentry of the competitor tastykake remains a high potential brand and we have a strong lineup of new products in the pipeline to drive brand excitement and sales organic breads which are squarely aligned with today’s consumer trends are clearly the highlight of the bread category and we are very excited about the opportunity we have with dave’s killer bread and alpine valley dkb is the leading organic bread brand in the us early in the second quarter we launched dkb into the breakfast category with four items with just a few weeks into the launch but the response so far has been very strong and we are working on other opportunities to grow this dynamic brand our work to refocus the alpine valley brand on the store perimeter freezer case and instore bakery continues we have updated the brand and packaging we have introduced new items and we have invested in additional sales resources we are gaining traction and we are encouraged by the progress being made organic bakery is running more efficiently and the margins in this business are in line with expectations product quality is high and utilization rates continue to increase now that we are producing the vast majority of our organic products inhouse we have reduced outside purchases from comanufacturers enhanced profitability and improved product consistency and quality companywide production cost as a percent of sales were down this quarter which partially offset increased cost for distribution recognized in sga while lower organic products cost was one factor we also improved manufacturing efficiencies and productivity across the company please keep in mind that these are early wins but they do indicate some of the progress being made as we introduce continuous improvement programs in our pilot bakeries as we get further into project centennial we’ll be implementing other initiatives to improve manufacturing operations and drive additional productivity savings we are well underway with project centennial you will find the roadmap for the project which we introduced on the fourth quarter call on slide nine our focus for  and  is to generate cost savings and reposition the organization for future growth as we move into  and beyond well begin to leverage our new capabilities and use the portion of the savings achieved to drive longterm sales growth in the range of  to  to drive earnings we expect to deliver net of investments back into the business at least  basis points of the ebitda margin expansion by  we have already made solid progress on key  project centennial objectives earlier this month we announced our plan for an enhanced organizational structure this new structure will better leverage the experience and strength of our team emphasizing brand growth and innovation drive accountability and deliver a lower cost operating model were also deep into creating a more centralized purchasing function that we expect will generate  million of run rate cost savings by  to achieve the targets weve laid out for   and beyond we still have a lot of work to do but were on schedule and im encouraged by the passion and the commitment flowers team members at all levels are bringing to our centennial work with that lets have steve to review the financials r steve kinsey thank you allen and good morning everyone since the detailed financials for the quarter are available in the release and the q was filed last night ill focus my comments today on the key variances cash flows and our outlook for the remainder of fiscal  as allen mentioned category trends in the first quarter were softer than expected on the topline the primary factors impacting sales were lower volumes of branded snack cakes lower volume and negative price mix of conventional branded breads and the divestiture of the mix business these declines were partially offset by growth in organic breads production cost as a percentage of sales declined  basis points resulting in higher gross margins we did lap roughly  million of cost associated with the tuscaloosa plant conversion a year ago but were considering that throughput volumes were less than expected due to lower sales we are pleased with how production cost were managed in the quarter relative to the prior quarter we produced the vast majority of our organic items inhouse which reduced outside purchases significantly improved manufacturing efficiencies also contributed to the reduction in production cost as a percentage of sales adjusted for items affecting comparability selling distribution and administrative expenses as a percent of sales increased  basis points the main driver being higher distributor distribution fees this was anticipated due to more sales going to the dsd system as a result of the rollout of dkv which began in the second quarter of fiscal  reflecting the net of higher gross margin and sda as a percentage of sales adjusted ebitda decreased  basis points to  of sales ill quickly comment on the few items affecting comparability during the quarter as weve previously communicated we sold our mix business which resulted in the  million gain project centennial cost were  million there was a  legal settlement related to on this classification lawsuit and net charge associated with lease terminations of  gaap earnings per share for the quarter was  up  from a year ago due primarily to the gain recognized on the sales of the mix business offset primarily by project centennial cost adjusted eps in the quarter was  down  per share compared to the prior year in addition to the decrease in sales and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted earnings per share were impacted by higher depreciation and amortization higher interest expense and a higher tax rate depreciation and amortization increased  million primarily due to the additional amortization of certain trademarks and accelerated depreciation associated with the lease terminations previously mentioned net interest expense increased  million due primarily to a higher average interest rate offset by lower net borrowings as you may recall in the third quarter of  we reduced our exposure to rising interest rate by issuing the fixed rate  notes the proceeds from the offering were used to reduce borrowings on our floating rate credit facilities changes in the accounting rules or stock options through the higher tax rate in the first quarter the tax rate actually came in below our expectations due to the timing of certain option exercises turning now to cash flow operating cash flow during the quarter was  million down  million from the prior year operating cash flows during the quarter were reduced roughly  million in project centennial cost a net change in hedge margin yearoveryear of approximately  million and the additional cash interest associated with the  notes capital expenditures were  million in the quarter as compared to approximately  million a year ago cash proceeds from the sales of mix business were roughly  million during the quarter we did pay down debt of approximately  million ending the quarter with roughly  million in net debt our net debt of trailing  month adjusted ebitda is two time regarding our outlook for the balance of fiscal  as allen mentioned during his comments category trends are softer than we expect and competitive activity remains elevated we began the year expecting the category to be roughly flat and now we see the category trending down approximately  as such we know see our trials trending towards the lower end of the previously issued sales guidance of flat to up  this guidance does include approximately  basis point impact from the divestiture of the mix business given the sales trends we now expect adjusted eps to fall in the midpoint of the previously guided range of  to  per share we continue to see project centennial consulting cost in the range of  million to  million for the full year as allen mentioned project centennial is well underway and we are all beginning to see meaningful progress to better position the company going forward evidence of that progress can be seen in some of the items i’ve called out earlier today in the call the divestiture of the mix business is one example this business which primarily met our internal needs was noncore and did not offer opportunities to grow national consumer brands in line with our longterm strategy by divesting this business we unlock substantial value and improved our financial position the lease terminations were another example of actions being taken todate to lower our cost going forward by these terminations we have lowered our future lease obligations by approximately  million over the next  years or roughly  million per year we are starting to see momentum build through the company we continue to realize the benefits of the initiatives that we talked about in the fourth quarter of  and now that the transition to the new organizational structure is underway we will begin to implement additional initiatives and look forward to reporting on additional cost savings going forward now i’ll pass the call back to allen allen l shiver thank you steve before we take questions i want to stress my confidence in the flowers team and our ability to achieve our longterm potential and create value for our shareholders with underdeveloped categories and new markets we have plenty of opportunity to grow in our core business and in adjacent categories even though we’re only a few months into the implementation phase of project centennial i see evidence of us becoming a more effective and efficient company able to meet the needs of the evolving consumer and deliver enhanced profitability to the bottomline thank you for your attention and now let’s begin the qa questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from farha aslam with stephens farha aslam hi good morning allen l shiver good morning farha farha aslam just a quick clarification on your comments about the category you highlighted that you now expect the category to decline about  could you  is that by volume and is that just in bread or does that include the whole entire sweet baked goods category allen l shiver farha we’re looking at the entire fresh packaged bread category to decline  and again this trend is very consistent with what we’ve seen in the past few years but we’re not predicting any significant change in category trend farha aslam and thats by volume not price or mix allen l shiver mostly volume farha aslam okay and then just as a followup could you share with us as you go through project centennial that you were rethinking your brands and how in particular youre thinking about dkb versus alpine and kind of the branded portfolio going forward in bread allen l shiver farha i think one of the exciting changes with project centennial is really focusing on becoming a national branded company as oppose to the regional company that weve been so naturally to do that certain brands are going to take priorities and the great news is that we have a wonderful assortment of strong brands that can build that need the dave’s killer bread certainly is very exciting in terms of the  not only as a reception the trade has given us but also the reception that were seeing from consumers dave’s killer bread is very much on target with the organic trends that were seeing in the food business in general so overall we will be focusing more on becoming a national branded company we will have certain brands that will be priority that will be national brands but at the same time in certain markets regional brands are still strong so well be very careful to make sure that our branding plans going forward are such that we grow the overall sales but we are focused on becoming a national branded company farha aslam okay and perhaps my final question is on the dsd segment versus the warehouse segment the warehouse sales just came in far below our expectations in consensus but in the press release you did highlight that some of the sales of product baked in warehouse is captured in dsd how should we understand that trend allen l shiver were still very committed to our dsd model again the success of dave’s killer bread as weve rolled it out on dsd really shows us the strength of dsd and what we can do with a brand like dave’s at the same time we continue to grow in our warehouse model were looking at other portions of the supermarket the parameter of the store the bakery deli that really lends itself to a different form of distribution so we do have some significant test markets underway there steve anything you want to add r steve kinsey yes i mean when you look at the intercompany sales our mesa ph facility produces quite a bit of the dave’s killer bread products so a lot of those sales are captured in dsd i mean the vast majority of the pressure in warehouse at obviously is the loss of the mix business and we also continue to see some pressure in the cake business whether its branded cake or store brand cake farha aslam okay thank you very much allen l shiver thank you farha operator the next question is from akshay jagdale with jefferies lubi kutua hey good morning this is actually lubi on for askhay just wanted to ask firstly on project centennial can you comment a little bit on when you expect to begin to see sort of a meaningful impact on the pl related to project centennial and then also related to that as you’ve begun to implement the program have you identified any incremental areas of savings that maybe you didnt see before allen l shiver lubi we have  we feel very confident about the  million of run rate cost reductions that would be achieved by  again on the longer term were still focused on the  basis points of improved margin over the three to five year period steve anything r steve kinsey yes i mean lubi in the quarter we did see savings of roughly  million on the continuing the initiatives we have begun in the fourth quarter those were around primarily travel entertainment and in certain corporate type events where weve eliminated any unnecessary travel or unnecessary events or unnecessary things like subscriptions and so its amazing as you add all that up across the company how the total but with regard to kind of the run rate as allen said we’re still looking at the purchase goods and services  million savings by  we are in the middle now across several work streams the rfp process so we have to have that completed by mid to late summer and then we should begin to see some of those savings rollin during the fourth quarter and really start picking up in  but a lot of that rolls into purchase goods and services we have announced some structural changes for the organization so we will continue to work on that and i think when you look at the project roadmap that’s in the deck you can see  we are still very focused on capturing our savings initiatives so we can begin to really invest in growth initiatives in ‘ that’s obviously that we’re not working on growth initiatives currently but ‘ is when we expect to see the meaningful bump within the project lubi kutua got it thanks that’s very helpful and then if i could ask a question just in terms of your guidance it does seem like you have tempered your guidance somewhat but on our math your outlook still in place a decent acceleration in sales and ebit growth relative to what we saw in the first quarter now i know that the top  for the topline the comps do get a little bit easier in the balance of the year and then you know in terms of ebit probably see some more savings related to project centennial come through but can you just talk a little bit about what gives you confidence that the guidance that you have laid out there is achievable thank you r steve kinsey sure i mean when you look at the remaining three quarters we have seen some improvement in trends coming into the second quarter q and q are typically stronger because of some bun seasonality for the summer month so we feel like we are positioned really well this year for the bun season we have had some wins across the company as far as shelf space from a bun position that was not there last year so we feel like that it gives us some confidence when we look at our outlook for the rest of the year and then we’re starting to see  we have some business wins on additional business and we also  we did have pretty heavy promotional activity in the first quarter so as allen said we are focused on being more targeted with our overall promotions for the rest of the year we won’t be eliminating them because the category operates with certain level of promotional activity remain competitive and then from a calls perspective we have been pretty conservative from including any savings from the project from the back half i do think the initiatives that we have implemented in q ‘ we will continue to see those benefits and then as we complete the rfp process we should begin to see some of the benefits of the other work streams from the project we look at production cost we are very focused on product efficiencies we have begun some pilot work at a couple of plants around continuous improvement we believe that’s going to give us some savings from production perspective and then from a cost perspective we are pretty much covered on our input cost for the rest of the year so we feel like we have good visibility there so i think that’s where we from a confidence perspective in the range and where we have got it to today we feel like things are achievable allen l shiver steve i’d just add that as we look at new markets where our share is lower than our core markets is exciting to see the support that we’re getting with the introduction of dave’s killer bread along with dave’s comes our full product line as we are expanding our space and improving our position especially in new markets so i think that will also be a factor as we look at the rest of this year lubi kutua thank you i’ll pass it on allen l shiver thank you operator the next question is from brett hundley with the vertical group allen l shiver hello brett operator brett go ahead your line is open brett hundley hi good morning can you guys hear me okay allen l shiver yes we can brett hundley alright i am sorry i am in a bad spot here so i am going to ask my questions real quick together did you guys give a mix impact to margins in dfd from greater private label sales relative to branded and then secondly with  really being a year of transition significant amount of change going on obviously a lot of this is happening against a really tough backdrop that is having an effect on all us food companies with your balance sheet where it is and your valuation where it is relative to peers would there be more of an appetite and a year like this to elevate share repurchase just given that a lot of forward earnings improvement can come from internal improvement and not necessarily indiscernible thank you allen l shiver yes i mean if you look at the mix we do not give a mix breakout on the increase in private label versus the impact of the branded product dsd was slightly up but we do not  but private label typically carries a lower margin and it covers a lot of everyday from a production standpoint but we do not breakout the mix impact there when you look at the relative valuation again from a capital allocation standpoint again there is  we remain prudent i dont think youll see step outside of balance of anything from a normal historical perspective when you look at now there are a lot of opportunities coming out of the project so from a capital perspective well be focused on project centennial and the value it drives longer term we did from a share repurchase perspective youll continue to see us behave opportunistically and if the cash flow warrants we’ll be in the market brett hundley thank you allen l shiver thank you brett operator our next question comes from brett andress with keybanc capital brett andress hey good morning allen l shiver good morning brett andress i had a question on your far reset comments im assuming that that’s factored into your updated guidance but i mean should we expect more sales pressure now in the back half because of that and some of the rationalization and do these resets apply to both your dsd and your warehouse segments allen l shiver primarily the resets apply to our dsd business and were looking for the resets to be positive in terms of overall growth many of the retailers only reset their bakery departments once or twice per year and with the opportunity in the sales that have been generated by the dave’s killer bread and turns that is generating on the retail side we expect the resets to be very favorable in terms of our overall product line r steve kinsey brett when you look at the guidance however we have factored in down about  basis points you should begin to see that in the fourth quarter and potentially youll see some of that in q of  as well brett andress got it thank you and i had a question on the performance management changes that i think you guys have been making can you comment on maybe how youre adjusting to hold the team accountable for project centennial and maybe what metrics you guys are using to measure performance across the enterprise allen l shiver brett overall i mentioned earlier the strength of our flowers team and i think thats really where you start if you look at the confidence that our team has in each other that is even though that structures are being adjusted and changed now there is still a tremendous confidence in our leadership team at all levels we are focusing on developing much deeper levels of accountability so that we can measure performance down to the lowest level and its not that we have not measured performance in the past but weve never taken it down to the levels that were looking at and performance will be rewarded and lack of performance will be addressed and its exciting to think about what can be accomplished with everyone focused on the same goals going forward r steve kinsey brett i mean specifically to that we just announced the change in the old structure so were still in the middle of developing the overall performance metrics but historically the company has been on one goal of ebitda but now as we move into a more brand focused company well begin to set specific targets based on functionality so if youre in sales youll have some component of the sales target manufacturing will have some component of manufacturing kpis plus probably an overall company goal but were not ready to announce or discuss those today brett andress got it and then i just had one last one can you give some more detail on the lease termination cost during the quarter i guess what were those related to was it a certain facility did you renegotiate new lease terms just some  anymore color you can provide there allen l shiver the primary savings there was if you recall when we made the acquisition of tasty baking back in  they had  there were publically traded company so they had a corporate headquarters facility as well so we’ve been able to exit that  we were able to exit that lease this year so that primary  thats the vast majority of all the savings brett andress thank you allen l shiver thank you operator the next question is from tim ramey with pivotal research group tim ramey thanks good morning allen l shiver good morning tim tim ramey it sounds like your payments or your costs relative to project centennial are pretty heavily weighted to the first quarter if we’re at  million to  million for the full year should we expect the costs relative to project centennial to be mainly a  item or will some flow into ‘ as well allen l shiver yes the vast majority of the cost for the project will be in ‘ and  the first half you will those start temper into back half there could be some in  but we are not anticipating anything of the magnitude we’re seeing this year operator the next question is from amit sharma with bmo capital markets amit sharma hi good morning everyone allen l shiver good morning amit amit sharma allen just wanted to go into your category growth outlook right so you went back to maybe negative one and that’s more consistent with how it’s been over the last few years just wanted to know so why did we start with a higher expectation when you gave guidance earlier and has happened in the last three months that compose you to go back to where the historical performance of the category has been allen l shiver amit this year if you look at the total categories actually if you look at total food business the food business and the bakery category has really started up slow we are encourage looking at sales the last several weeks that we’re seeing that hopefully the sales trend is changing and we’re optimistic as steve mentioned earlier looking into back half of the year but there are some things that are taking place i think with today’s consumer that are influencing the overall category and we’re addressing those especially with brands like daves killer bread as well as looking at different opportunities in the parameter of the store the bakery deli elsewhere so it is very much with changing category and a changing market place but we feel like we are in very good position to take advantage of it still if you look at the overall fresh bakery categories still a  billion category which is the number three category in the entire supermarket so even though the category is relatively soft it’s still extremely large and there is a lot of opportunity for us to grow this business as we look forward amit sharma and thats really helpful and i think thats well understood just i was trying to get like between guidance given earlier to where we are some of these are fairly longer term place right but what has happened in the last three months or last four months where is it the competitive environment is it you’re seeing a little bit more promotion or you’re seeing more softness in the takeaways what has happened for your outlook for the category to be little bit more negative now allen l shiver again the category trends are pretty consistent with what we’ve seen in past years it did start up slow and sluggish in terms of category promotional activity or any major changes i mean there is nothing you can put your finger on in the last two to three months it’s simply been a slow start to the year and hopefully looking at the last few weeks hopefully we’re seeing that turn to a more positive trend but it did require us to basically where we are at this point required to us adjust our guidance to the lowend of the range amit sharma got it thats helpful and then just two more from me in this revised guidance for sales any sense for how much is coming from dkb versus the rest of the core fresh bread category or portfolio for you guys allen l shiver when you look at the performance of organics together i’d say we are still trending with what we were seeing when we made the acquisition so you are seeing the organic  and i’d say our brands are trending in line with the category as far as growth of course dave’s is driving the vast majority of that we didn’t  we haven’t given that specifically but when you look how our overall organics are performing and we look into the full year performance right now we are trending in total ahead of our plan amit sharma got it and then last one from allen a little bit longer term so you are outlining pretty large changes throughout the organization and it looks like the end of that will be much a replace from a company margin perspective but is there any risk or how are you mitigating that risk that between now and let’s say end of  early  the company is focused on project centennial that this is still a tough category to operate on daytoday basis how do you ensure that should operating focus remains on that and not get distracted by all these changes that you’re putting in place allen l shiver yes i mentioned earlier what give us me confidence is the strength of our team i have said it many times we have the best team in the food industry our team understands the category continues to evolve and our company must evolve and change with the category so very confident that all of the adjustments that we’ve laid out so far are going to be implemented properly and as we look at the next two to three years that implementation has always been our strength and i feel like that we have done a very good job of laying out a multiyear improvement to our overall organization we had our entire team together leader  the senior leadership team just a few week ago and i have never seen so much support from all levels of the organization against project centennial so we are focused on building this company for the longterm and we have got the team in place to do it so again i am very confident but it is very critical that we do a great job implement project centennial but at the same time we have got to stay on top of today’s business today and we are also focused on doing exactly that but it really all comes back to the strength of our team amit sharma got it thank you so much allen l shiver thank you operator the next question is from bill chappell with suntrust william chappell thanks good morning allen l shiver good morning bill william chappell hey just trying to understand the comments on the category if we go back from what we’ve heard from most food companies it what was that if consumer takeaway in general in january and february was pretty weak you got a little better in march and it’s gotten better in april but you gave kind of guidance i think updated guidance in midfebruary and now we’re kind of talking about it being even worse so is that the way to look at it that things were holding up okay for at least the bread category for the first two months and have gotten worse since then or is there something i am missing allen l shiver i think when you look generally coming up and february when we gave guidance we were seeing kind of a sluggish start but that’s typically february has been a slow month in our industry so we are beginning to see some trends pickup because of the where the quarter came in what you had to make up to get back into the upper end of your range would be pretty significant for the rest of the year so don’t see the category  from a category perspective there would be no way to make up the loss that you had in the first quarter from a topline perspective william chappell so trends as we look into march and april a little bit better it’s just you can’t makeup kind of the quarter in general allen l shiver yes march was better we’re actually seeing better trends in april and may but i don’t see  we don’t see that there is the opportunity to make up the loss from the first quarter william chappell okay and then just making sure i understood if you’re expecting the category to be down  and you to be even though at the low end of  to  what is that implying in terms of market share gains for this year allen l shiver from a share perspective we did see growth in the first quarter from a share perspective the big driver of our confidence has to do with the organic category and the performance we are seeing there i don’t have a specific shared number with me but we are anticipating share growth just like we saw in the first quarter william chappell okay and then last question and sorry if i just a little confused but sounds like in last year you didn’t  there were some consulting charges throughout the year for a project centennial that were not excluded and this year we’re kind of excluding everything so how should i look that on a yearoveryear basis i mean is there any project centennial that is not excluded this year or last year sorry for the confusing question allen l shiver yes i mean so far we did not have any cost in the first quarter so as the year progresses we had roughly a little over  million last year i think it was it was roughly a million or so q  million q and about  million q so we will call those out as we  as the year progresses so it was about  last year william chappell okay and that wasn’t excluded last year allen l shiver no because of the magnitude but now that we’re well into the project if you recall in december we actually finished up our diligence space and we made the decision to move forward so once we made that decision to move forward with all  with the project that’s when the cost really ramped up william chappell got it okay thanks so much allen l shiver thank you operator that concludes our questionandanswer session id like to turn the call back to allen shiver for closing remarks allen l shiver thank you for your attention today were excited about project centennial and we are very excited about the plans we have laid for the not only the rest of this year but looking forward into next two to three years our leadership team is  behind the initiative and we look forward  plans we will continue to keep you apprised in terms of plans and potential benefits
