future generations opening doors for future generations careers this article originally appeared in the bentley magazine opening doors for future generations december   robert g ripley jr ’ topics bentley magazine alumni bob ripley credits bentley with opening doors to his first job which turned out to be at shawmut bank after many years as a banking executive in wealth management he came into his own as an entrepreneur “i truly enjoyed developing my own business culture which led to great client relationships” he says of having brought a trust tax and compliance software service to market “it was really satisfying to help people by providing a strong business solution”not yet retired the alumnus invests his time and resources in community youth mentoring and youth ministry organizations“days should be filled with helping people whether they are family or kids who need to get off the streets there’s a lot of hurt in the world if one is blessed with good health and finances one should give back”bentley is another of bob’s passions he has stayed engaged with the school since his earliest days of commuting from medford to waltham along with attending many bentleysponsored events he supports the annual fund every year with an increased leadership gift visiting the campus from his cape cod home he enjoys meeting students and seeing firsthand that his support is a good investment“professors rae anderson and dick cross inspired us to think of having an exciting career and i certainly did” he says “if we can connect our careers and successes to bentley then we should get reacquainted with our college — and give regularly if we can”earlier this year revising his estate plan bob fulfilled a longtime dream his generous bequest to bentley will establish an endowed scholarship fund for students majoring in accountancy“i want to say thank you to the place that gave me my start i feel obligated to pay back that opportunity and pass it along to the next generation”there are many ways to create a lasting legacy at bentley learn more about gift planning   related stories jul   no summer internship don’t panic may   make the most of your summer
