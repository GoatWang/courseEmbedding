to really teal  turquoise organizations  a customer focused strategy requires higher levels of integration it is relational and moral based on empathy and other moral skills it forces individuals to listen with emotional embodied qualities because that is what listening involves and gives feedback for reflection beyond the current construction of self a customer focus end oriented and thus paves the way for rational coordination to escape the iron cage of bureaucracy that turns means into ends human ends provide metrics for scientific improvement in engineering terms to replace abstract formal rationality of remote control accounting ur is in the ecosystem which is richly connected to all these levels cost and productivity in lr mind body and human nature conscious in ul and a positive vision of environmentalism in a culture of abundance that integrates quality of life and ends for stakeholders in ll within the morality of empathy service and ethics of contribution thats how this model of the sustainable firm integrates all quads eugene pustoshkin on  – transformations on the path to really teal  turquoise organizations  thank you paul i am convinced that a secondtier organization would require more explicit secondtier understanding of consciousness and culture after all it’s a holistic and integrative tier the one which comes to integrating a vast array of lifespaces still an integral consciousness even if it doesn’t know any integral framework would probably be able—or strive to—naturally design teal or turquoise worldspaces it is a natural tendency of consciousnesses to weave a cultural fabric which is correspondent to their common altitude it would be a tetramesh of factors including the emergence of more sophisticated cybernetic environments in lr which would potentially mediate and inspire the greater depth in consciousness i can only speculate now but i would love if people would gather in transgenerational action research groups and actually test the waters of reality eugene pustoshkin on  – transformations on the path to really teal  turquoise organizations  thank you arthur it would be really terrific to see what a true teal company could be the one which is founded and grounded in the teal altitude of consciousness and being some people say that we have to deal with the first tier first but i am not sure about that it is as if to say before leaving your cave and exploring the world you have to study every inch of that archaeological cave and make it very comfortable both movements are necessary the world is in crisis of being limited to firsttier solutions paul hess on  – transformations on the path to really teal  turquoise organizations  i like the way you state the limitations of laloux and the difference between teal and turquoise as well as strategic considerations for transformation between stages i want to add to that and show how my work on models of the firm organization develops some of these themes in more detail although i did not attempt to distinguish between teal and turquoise as clearly as you do it’s clear that laloux is almost entirely green in his focus on participation which is the green vehicle to individual authentic expression and procedural symbol of equality laloux explicitly states that a customer focused business strategy is not an important feature distinguishing kinds of organizations here he reveals that he has no clue what is going with world class business laloux is firmly in the green “stakeholder model of the firm” as opposed to a second tier “sustainable model of the firm” a customer focused business strategy in fact changes the logic of organizations with top down “remote control accounting” explained in detail by business historians kaplan and johnson in their widely accepted critique the customer focused strategy creates the horizontal organization driven by market demand not of price signals but human needs to integrate specializations into process flows systemically this leads to four revolutions in management thinking about organization economics science and morality i explain this as i contrast three models of firm organization shareholder stakeholder and sustainable firms orange green and above i model this in detail by  principles and  organizational features that show how the customer focus changes each functional specialty management accounting hr product development operations marketing etc httpintegralleadershipreviewcomsustainablefirm my sustainable model of corporate organization was developed more inductively through a sociological “grounded theory” methodology more than guided initially by using theoretical categories deductively so integral categories are not explicit especially because i was writing for a broader audience but anyone in integral can see the categories which was why i was invited to publish in integral leadership review april  nevertheless this level of detail of analysis is not usually found in integral or spiral so there was little discussion to follow this level of detail took me  years to formulate into an article growing out of my phd research in sociology i did not explicitly parse out the distinctions between teal and turquoise which your article makes me think about the practical problem i was actually addressing i can now more clearly see was the transition from teal to turquoise involved in implementing the basic framework for the new firm total quality management tqm now called six sigma which at best are understood in teal terms teal and turquoise can be distinguished between a process versus more systems orientation to use the memeonomics distinction of said dawlabani six sigma is all about process improvement to serve customers but has lacked systematic organizational design to support its new logic tqm and six sigma has also lacked looking at customers as whole persons and the relationships between stakeholders or customers in those stakeholder roles i gave an example of a strategy that integrates stakeholders with a focus on health through reducing toxicity that would improve quality of life for customers and employees and workplace productivity while reducing health care costs and environmental impact this winwin logic between stakeholders is based on reducing economic tradeoffs between cost quality speed etc not green wishful thinking although green gets it at the teal level total quality management was sometimes reduced in understanding by green to participation but had radical implications for management accountability seen in japan mostly that were eventually stripped off in the american context and reduced back to orange more narrowly scientific and statistical reasoning thus the later term “six sigma” which means  parts per million defect levels as a high level of quality as an internal metric not necessarily even customer focused systematic organizational integration around customers has always been the challenge my article did not develop the upper left quadrant as much as your chart does but i have elaborated one aspect of that elsewhere the epistemology of contextual reasoning following a logic of connection a more accessible version of high theory i like your “deep process rule principles” which i think captures of six sigma improvement methodologies as standards to revise standards for work at any level of organization within any location of the organization anyway thanks for making me think of this again arthur ten wolde on  – transformations on the path to really teal  turquoise organizations  excellent work did not know russian companies were striving to become tealyellow that is in itself good news now in the netherlands which is regarded as the forefront of the circular economy we have approximately  green companies generally with yellow in the board while at the same time still a lot of orange and blue elements in the company undergoing further transformation turquoise i encounter only at the personal level and in some smaller nonprofit organisations so indeed dont skip any stage because if you try your organisation will fall back inevitably and be even further from home  in this case from becoming a yellowturquoise circular company  – mni wiconi  water is life  integral leadership review on  – cohosting creating optimal
