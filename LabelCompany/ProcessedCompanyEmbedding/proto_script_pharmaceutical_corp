 we had current assets of  and current liabilities of  resulting in a working capital deficit of  we had a working capital surplus of  at december   the change in working capital is principally a result of approximately  liabilities assumed in the reverse merger transaction see note  to the financial statements net cash provided by operating activities was  during the nine months ended september   compared to  in net cash used during the nine months ended september   the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due to changes in accounts receivable cash flows used in

either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments offbalance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no offbalance sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources  critical accounting estimates   the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates it is possible that accounting estimates and assumptions may be material to the company due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments past due balances over  days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate adversely affecting their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required based on managements assessment the company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance balances that remain outstanding after the company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable bad debt expense loss recovery for the nine months ended september   and  was  and  respectively collectability the company is governed by medicare standards and therefore agrees to accept the medicareapproved amounts as the total payment for the service or item the company also agrees to bill medicare and other or suppliers directly on behalf of the patient we report patient accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from medicare other thirdparty payers and patients our process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections and trends in reimbursement  revenue recognition the companys revenue recognition policies comply with fasb asc topic  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it provided the services shipped the products and billed its customers insurance companies and government agencies and no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured the companys billings are subject to insurance company and government regulatory agency adjustments the company revises the amount of revenue recognized when the insurance company and government regulatory adjustments are known to the company the adjustments to the amounts the company can bill are changed approximately every five years when the government asks companies to submit a new bid there is approximately one year between the time the company is notified of any price changes until the time the new amounts come into effect longlived assets the company applies the provisions of asc topic  property plant and equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets then assets are written down first followed by other longlived assets of the operation to fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the assets as september   and december   there were no impairment losses recognized for longlived assets income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  asc  requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely of being realized on examination for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test no tax benefit is recorded the adoption had no effect on the companys financial statements  prior to the transaction described in note  pspc was taxed as an s corporation for income tax

agreement whereby we acquired  of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of pspc in exchange for  shares of our common stock upon completion of the transaction we had an aggregate of  shares of common stock issued and outstanding as a result of the share exchange agreement pspc is now our wholly owned subsidiary the exchange of shares with pspc was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting since we had no net monetary assets and pspc obtained control of us accordingly the merger of pspc into us was recorded as a recapitalization of pspc pspc being treated as the continuing entity the historical financial statements presented are the financial statements of pspc the equity of pspc is presented as the equity of the combined company and the capital stock account of pspc is adjusted to reflect the par value of the outstanding and issued common stock of the legal acquirer proto script formerly yanex after giving effect to the number of shares issued in the share exchange agreement the share exchange agreement has been treated as a recapitalization and not as a business combination therefore no pro forma information is disclosed at the date of this transaction the net liabilities of the legal acquirer proto script formerly yanex were  our health care insurance contracts allow us the ability to service patients nationally we are seeking to expand our market through additional contracts and open several repair facilities throughout the continental united states currently we have repair facilities in las vegas nevada ranchocucamonga and anaheim california our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern during the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december   our common stock trades on the otc pink sheets under the symbol pscr our principal office is located at  th street suite  rancho cucamonga california  our telephone number is   our fiscal year end is december  recent developments on april   we were awarded a contract by the center for medicare  medicaid services that begins on july   and expires on december   the contract requires us to furnish certain items of durable medical equipment prosthetics orthotics and supplies dmepos under the medicare dmepos competitive bidding program our revenue is expected to increase because of the contract results of operations comparison of results of operations for the three months ended september   and  sales for the three months ended september   our net sales were  an increase of  compared to net sales of  for the same period in  the increase is due to a new contract that were we awarded that began on july   cost of goods sold for the three months ended september   our cost of goods sold were  an increase of  compared to  for the same period in  the increase is due to the increase in net sales operating expenses for the three months ended september   our operating expenses were  an increase of  compared to  for the same period in  the increase is not significant net income loss we generated net income of  for the three months ended september   compared to a net loss of  for the same period in  this increase was due to an increase in sales comparison of results of operations for the nine months ended september   and  sales for the nine months ended september   our net sales were  an increase of  compared to net sales of  for the same period in  the increase is due to a new contract that were we awarded that began on july   cost of goods sold for the nine months ended september   our cost of goods sold were  a decrease of  compared to  for the same period in  the decrease lower product costs operating expenses for the nine months ended september   our operating expenses were  a decrease of  compared to  for the same period in  the decrease is due to a decrease in amortization expense related to our intangible assets and a decrease in payroll and related costs net income loss we generated net income of  for the nine months ended september   compared to a net loss of  for the same period in  this increase was due to lower cost of sales and lower operating expenses liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had  in cash at september   we had current assets of  and current liabilities of  resulting in a working capital deficit of  we had a working capital surplus of  at december   the change in working capital is principally a result of approximately  liabilities assumed in the reverse merger transaction see note  to the financial statements net cash provided by operating activities was  during the nine months ended september   compared to  in net cash used during the nine months ended september   the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due to changes in accounts receivable cash flows used in investing activities were  during the nine months ended september   compared to  during the nine months ended september   the decrease in cash used in investing activities is fewer purchases of property and equipment cash flows used in financing activities were  during the nine months ended september   compared to  during the nine months ended september   the decrease in cash used in financing activities is due an increase in cash overdraft and advances from nonrelated party offset by a reduction in distributions to stockholder inflation the amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position the net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments offbalance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no offbalance sheet transactions that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates it is possible that accounting estimates and assumptions may be material to the company due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount the company expects to collect the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments past due balances over  days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectability if the financial condition of the companys customers were to deteriorate adversely affecting their ability to make payments additional allowances would be required based on managements assessment the company provides for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance balances that remain outstanding after the company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable bad debt expense loss recovery for the nine months ended september   and  was  and  respectively collectability the company is governed by medicare standards and therefore agrees to accept the medicareapproved amounts as the total payment for the service or item the company also agrees to bill medicare and other or suppliers directly on behalf of the patient we report patient accounts receivable net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts and adjustments patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and primarily consist of amounts due from medicare other thirdparty payers and patients our process for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections and trends in reimbursement revenue recognition the companys revenue recognition policies comply with fasb asc topic  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it provided the services shipped the products and billed its customers insurance companies and government agencies and no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured the companys billings are subject to insurance company and government regulatory agency adjustments the company revises the amount of revenue recognized when the insurance company and government regulatory adjustments are known to the company the adjustments to the amounts the company can bill are changed approximately every five years when the government asks companies to submit a new bid there is approximately one year between the time the company is notified of any price changes until the time the new amounts come into effect longlived assets the company applies the provisions of asc topic  property plant and equipment which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operation to which the assets relate to the carrying amount if the operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets then assets are written down first followed by other longlived assets of the operation to fair value fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the assets as september   and december   there were no impairment losses recognized for longlived assets income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc  requires a company to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the

a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry for more information download the phrma
