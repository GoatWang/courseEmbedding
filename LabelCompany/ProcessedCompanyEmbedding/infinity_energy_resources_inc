conjunction with the audited financial statements and accompanying notes in item  “financial statements and supplementary data” of our annual report on form k filed with the sec   nature of operations   the company is engaged in the exploration of potential oil and gas resources in the perlas and tyra concession blocks offshore nicaragua in the caribbean sea the “nicaraguan concessions” or “concessions” which contain a total of approximately  million acres the company sold its whollyowned subsidiary infinity oil and gas of texas inc in  and its whollyowned subsidiary infinity oil and gas of wyoming inc was administratively dissolved in    the company has been pursuing exploration and development of the nicaraguan concessions which represents its principal asset and only exploration and development project on march   infinity signed the contracts relating to its nicaraguan concessions infinity has conducted activities to develop geological information from the processing and evaluation of newly acquired and existing d seismic data that was acquired for the nicaraguan concessions infinity has conducted activities to develop geological information from the processing and evaluation of d seismic data that was acquired for the nicaraguan concessions the company has identified multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial exploratory well on the perlas block in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves subject to receipt from the nicaraguan government of authorizations for the drilling of up to five wells financing and satisfaction of other conditions in order to meet its obligations under the perlas block of the nicaraguan concession the company has to drill its initial exploratory well during  or risk being in default and losing its rights under the nicaraguan concessions the work plan on the tyra block now requires the company to shoot additional seismic prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling the company is attempting to negotiate with the nicaraguan government to seek the waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the tyra block and extension of time to complete its initial well there can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement the current environment for oil and gas development projects especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industrywide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects there can be no assurance whether the company will be able to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its nicaraguan projects   on may   the company completed the private placement the “may  private placement” of a  million principal amount senior convertible note the “note” and a common stock purchase warrant to purchase  shares of the company’s common stock the “warrant” with an institutional investor the “investor” at the closing the investor acquired the note by paying  in cash and issuing a promissory note secured by cash with a principal amount of  the “investor note” assuming all amounts payable to the company under the investor note are paid the may  private placement will result in gross proceeds of  million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions the company will receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the investor note the investor may at its option and at any time voluntarily prepay the investor note in whole or in part as of march   an additional  was funded under the investor note for a total of  advanced to the company        the investor must prepay the investor note in whole or in part upon the occurrence of one or more mandatory prepayment events these include i the investor’s conversion of the note into shares of common stock upon which the investor will be required to prepay the investor note on a dollarfordollar basis for each subsequent conversion of the note and ii the company’s delivering a mandatory prepayment notice to the investor after it has received governmental authorizations from the nicaraguan authorities necessary to commence drilling on at least five sites within the concessions and the receipt of forbearance or similar agreements relative to its general creditors among other conditions   the note matures on the threeyear anniversary of its issuance bears interest at  per annum and is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the company’s common stock at  per share the “conversion price” as a part of the may  private placement the company issued a warrant to the investor giving it the right to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of the company’s common stock at an exercise price of  per share the warrant is exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period of seven years from the date of issuance the note ranks senior to the company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the company excluding the concessions   in addition the company continues to seek offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the nicaraguan concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement   going concern   as reflected in the accompanying statements of operations the company has had a history of losses in addition the company has a significant working capital deficit and is currently experiencing substantial liquidity issues   the company has relied on raising debt and equity capital in recent years in order to fund its ongoing maintenanceexpenditure obligations under the nicaraguan concession for its daytoday operations and its corporate overhead since it has generated no operating revenues or cash flows in recent history   the company is in subperiod  of the exploration phase of the year concession for both perlas and tyra as of march   subperiod  of the nicaraguan concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block during  and the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block the company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the perlas block as required in subperiod  and will have to perform supplemental eia work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the nicaraguan government the work plan on the tyra block for subperiod  requires the company to shoot additional seismic which is estimated to cost approximately  prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling the company is attempting to negotiate with the nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the tyra block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling there can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of the requirement   in accordance with the nicaraguan concession agreements the company has previously provided the ministry of energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of  for perlas expired march  and  for tyra expired september  the company has also made all required expenditures related to the nicaraguan concessions for training programs and as “area fees” for each respective year for  through  in accordance with the nicaraguan concession agreements the company must provide the ministry of energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts which total  for the perlas block and  for the tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the nicaraguan concessions to replace the expired letters of credit the minimum cash requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in the nicaraguan concessions for the next twelvemonth period will be approximately  for the perlas block which includes all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well and  for the tyra block assuming the waiver is granted regarding the seismic mapping if such waiver is not granted the company estimates it will require approximately  for the seismic mapping finally the company estimates it will need approximately  to prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the concessions        if the company does not receive the funding anticipated under its may  private placement it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund  the required letters of credit to the nicaraguan government  the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block of the nicaraguan concessions during   the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block of the nicaraguan concessions should it be unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the nicaraguan government  the payment of normal daytoday operations and corporate overhead and  the payment of outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due these are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during  or the company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its nicaragua concessions will be in significant doubt the company is actively seeking new outside sources of debt and equity capital in addition to the may  private placement in order to fund the substantial needs enumerated above however there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the technical defaults existing on the nicaraguan concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements relative to drilling the exploratory wells the current environment for oil and gas development projects especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industrywide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects these may provide substantial impediments for the company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its nicaraguan projects   due to the uncertainties related to these matters there exists substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   management estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates significant estimates with regard to the financial statements include the estimated carrying value of unproved properties the estimated fair value of derivative liabilities senior convertible note payable stockbased awards and overriding royalty interests and the realization of deferred tax assets   oil and gas properties   unproved properties are assessed periodically at least annually to ascertain whether impairment has occurred unproved properties whose costs are individually significant are assessed individually by considering the primary lease terms of the properties the holding period of the properties geographic and geologic data obtained relating to the properties and estimated discounted future net cash flows from the properties estimated discounted future net cash flows are based on discounted future net revenues associated with probable and possible reserves risk adjusted as appropriate where it is not practicable to assess individually the amount of impairment of properties for which costs are not individually significant such properties are grouped for purposes of assessing impairment the amount of impairment assessed is deducted from the costs to be amortized and reported as a period expense when the impairment is recognized all unproved property costs as of march   and december   relate to the nicaraguan concessions in assessing the unproved property costs for impairment the company takes into consideration various information including i the terms of the government concessions ii the status of the company’s compliance with the nicaraguan concessions’ requirements iii the ongoing evaluation of the seismic data iv the commodity prices for oil and gas products v the overall environment related to oil and gas exploration and development projects for unproven targets in unproven regions of the world vi the availability of financing for financial and strategic partners and vii other factors that would impact the viability of a significant longterm oil and gas exploration and development project        the current environment for oil and gas development projects especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industrywide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects these may provide substantial impediments for the company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its nicaraguan projects the company has performed its impairment tests as of december   and has concluded that a full impairment reserve should be provided on the costs capitalized for the nicaraguan concessions oil and gas properties all costs related to the nicaraguan concessions from december   through march   have been charged to operating expenses as incurred   concentrations   the company’s business plan consists of developing the nicaraguan concessions and it expects to be active in nicaragua for the foreseeable future given sufficient capital the political climate in nicaragua could become unstable and subject to radical change over a short period of time in the event of a significant negative change in political and economic stability in the vicinity of the nicaraguan concessions or of the inability of the company to obtain sufficient financing the company might be forced to abandon or suspend its efforts and its rights under its nicaraguan concessions   derivative instruments   the company accounts for derivative instruments or hedging activities under the provisions of asc  derivatives and hedging  asc  requires the company to record derivative instruments at their fair value if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges if any are recognized in earnings changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment are recognized in earnings   the purpose of hedging is to provide a measure of stability to the company’s cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk as of march   and december   and during the periods then ended the company had no oil and natural gas derivative arrangements outstanding   as a result of certain terms conditions and features included in certain common stock purchase warrants issued by the company notes   and  those warrants are required to be accounted for as derivatives at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recognized in operations   income taxes   the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes this method requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial accounting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities the tax benefits of tax loss carryforwards and other deferred taxes are recorded as an asset to the extent that management assesses the utilization of such assets to be more likely than not management routinely assesses the realizability of the company’s deferred income tax assets and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is determined that deferred income tax assets may not be fully utilized in future periods management considers future taxable earnings in making such assessments numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable earnings including such factors as future operating conditions when the future utilization of some portion of the deferred tax asset is determined not to be more likely than not a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded deferred tax asset when the company can project that a portion of the deferred tax asset can be realized through application of a portion of tax loss carryforward the company will record that utilization as a deferred tax benefit and recognize a deferred tax asset in the same amount there can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require the company to adjust its deferred income tax asset valuation allowance in a future period the company recognized a deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance of  at march   and december          the company is potentially subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the calculation of income tax liabilities if any involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex income tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions it recognizes certain income tax positions that meet a morelikelythan not recognition threshold if the company ultimately determines that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary it will reverse the liability and recognize an income tax benefit no liability for unrecognized tax benefit was recorded as of march   and december     asset retirement obligations   the company records estimated future asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of asc  asc  requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related longlived asset subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement liability is required to be accreted each period the company’s asset retirement obligations consist of costs related to the plugging of wells the removal of facilities and equipment and

of march     note  – income taxes   for income tax purposes the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  as of december   which expire from  through  the company has provided a  valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its net deferred tax asset   the company has not completed the filing of tax returns for the tax years  through  therefore all such tax returns are open to examination by the internal revenue service   the internal revenue code contains provisions under section  which limit a company’s ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the event that it has experienced a more than  change in ownership over a threeyear period current estimates prepared by the company on a preliminary basis indicate that no ownership changes have occurred and are currently not subject to an annual limitation but may be further limited by additional ownership changes which may occur in the future   note  – commitments and contingencies   the company has not maintained insurance coverage on its us domestic oil and gas properties for several years the company is not in compliance with federal and state laws regarding the us domestic oil and gas properties the company’s known compliance issues relate to the texas railroad commission regarding administrative filings and renewal permits relative to its texas oil and gas properties that were sold in  the ultimate resolution of these compliance issues could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial statements   nicaraguan concessions   in april  we filed with the nicaraguan government an environmental impact assessment “eia” covering proposed seismic activities on our nicaraguan concessions the filing of the eia was followed by a comment period during which there was interaction between us the ministerio del ambiente y los recursos naturales de nicaragua an agency of the nicaraguan government and the autonomous regions of nicaragua that are nearest to the nicaraguan concessions in april  the eia was formally approved by the nicaraguan government and we were cleared to commence d and d seismic mapping activities in the area in late  and early  we contracted with a fully integrated geoscience company that provides geological geophysical and reservoir services to the global oil and gas industry to conduct d and d seismic data covering selected areas within the boundaries of the nicaraguan concessions   the final approval of the eia by the nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on april   began subperiod  for both the tyra and perlas blocks as defined in the nicaraguan concessions the company believes it has satisfied the acquisition processing and interpretation of seismic data required in subperiod  for both the perlas and tyra blocks therefore it is now in subperiod  of the exploration phase of the year concession for both perlas and tyra as of june   subperiod  of the nicaraguan concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block during  and the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block the company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the perlas block as required in subperiod  and will have to perform supplemental eia work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the nicaraguan government the work plan on the tyra block for subperiod  requires the company to shoot additional seismic which is estimated to cost approximately  prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling the company is negotiating with the nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the tyra block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement        during late december  we completed the d seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the nicaraguan concessions at that point we believe that the newly acquired d seismic data together with the previously acquired reprocessed d seismic has helped us further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with d seismic in the eocene zone our geological consultants have estimated that these eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons principally oil in place in addition the new d seismic acquired in  provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the cretaceous zone which we could not evaluate using less precise older d seismic mapping we have identified multiple promising sites on the perlas block for exploratory drilling and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves given sufficient financing we believe that we have performed all work necessary as of june   to proceed to subperiod  for the perlas block as defined in the nicaraguan concessions which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block within the following oneyear period we must first prepare and submit a supplemental eia to the nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the perlas block which had not been completed as of march     the company has not yet submitted the eia supplement to the nicaraguan government and therefore has not received a drilling permit however assuming that government does accept the supplemental eia and grant the drilling permit the company will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the perlas block during  or risk being in default and losing our rights under the nicaraguan concessions   the company is in technical default of the nicaraguan concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the nicaraguan government in accordance with the nicaraguan concession agreements the company had previously provided the ministry of energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of  for perlas expired march  and  for tyra expired september  the company had also made all required expenditures related to the nicaraguan concessions for training programs and as “area fees” for each respective year for  through  the company is attempting to negotiate the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total  for the perlas block and  for the tyra block with the nicaraguan government and its lenders however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the regard the company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the nicaraguan concessions agreements except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit   the company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future in order to fund  the required letters of credit to the nicaraguan government  the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block of the nicaraguan concessions during   the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block of the nicaraguan concessions if it is unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the nicaraguan government  the payment of normal daytoday operations and corporate overhead and  the payment of outstanding debt and financial obligations as they become due these are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully mitigated during  or the company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its nicaragua concessions will be in significant doubt the company completed the may  private placement in may  in an effort to obtain its required capital see note  to the financial statements   the company is also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the nicaraguan concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement accordingly it intends to finance our business strategy through external financing which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings joint ventures sale of working or other interests employment of working capital and cash flow from operations if any and net proceeds from the sales of assets        the following charts set forth the minimum work programs required under for the perlas and tyra blocks comprising the concessions in

october   the company announced that it had entered into a letter of intent “loi” with granada exploration llc which has agreed to join with the company to explore for potential hydrocarbons beneath infinity’s  millionacre oil and gas concessions in the caribbean sea offshore nicaragua under the terms of the loi granada exploration will provide its services in exchange for a working interest in the nicaraguan concessions the scope of such services will be more specifically described in a mutually acceptable exploration services agreement “esa” which is currently being negotiated the esa is anticipated to provide that granada will earn an assignment from infinity of an undivided  working interest in the concessions based on an  net revenue interest granada and infinity are also anticipated to enter into a joint operating agreement granada may at its discretion participate in an initial exploratory well for up to an additional undivided  working interest on a prospectbyprospect basis with such additional interest to be based on an  net revenue interest        the loi is subject to granada’s normal and customary due diligence including the evaluation of the company’s form k and q filings documents showing that the company is in good standing regarding the nicaraguan concessions and with the nicaraguan government negotiation and approval of mutually acceptable formal agreements and final approval by a majority of the partners that comprise granada exploration llc the parties continue to negotiate the terms of the esa but have not entered into definitive agreements granada has not completed its normal and customary due diligence with progress being delayed due to the current environment affecting oil and gas exploration projects and uncertainties involving the status of the nicaraguan concessions   lack of compliance with law regarding domestic properties   infinity has not been in compliance with existing federal state and local laws rules and regulations for its previously owned domestic oil and gas properties and this could have a material or significantly adverse effect upon the liquidity capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of infinity all domestic oil and gas properties held by infinity – wyoming and infinitytexas were disposed of prior to march   however the company may remain liable for certain asset retirement costs should the new owners not complete their obligations management believes the total asset retirement obligations recorded of  as of march   and december   are sufficient to cover any potential noncompliance liabilities relative to the to the plugging of abandoned wells the removal of facilities and equipment and site restoration on oil and gas properties for its former oil and gas properties the company has not maintained insurance on the domestic properties for a number of years nor has it ownedproduced any oil  gas properties for a number of years   litigation   the company is subject to numerous claims and legal actions in which vendors are claiming breach of contract due to the company’s failure to pay amounts due the company believes that it has made adequate provision for these claims in the accompanying financial statements   the company is currently involved in litigation as follows   ● in october  the state of texas filed a lawsuit naming infinitytexas the company and the corporate officers of infinitytexas seeking  of reclamation costs associated with a single well in addition to administrative expenses and penalties the company engaged in negotiations with the state of texas in late  and early  and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability in this action and any extension of this to other texas wells to  which amount has been paid certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter       pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the state of texas the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter and the officers are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the company therefore to the extent they might actually occur these liabilities are the obligations of the company management estimates that the liabilities associated with this matter will not exceed  calculated as  for each of the  infinitytexas operated wells this related liability less the payment made to the state of texas in  in the amount of  is included in the asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheets     ● cambrian consultants america inc “cambrian” filed an action in the district court of harris county texas number cv on september   against infinity energy resources inc resulting from certain professional consulting services provided for quality control and management of seismic operations during november and december  on the nicaraguan concessions cambrian provided these services pursuant to a master consulting agreement with infinity dated november   and has claimed breach of contract for failure to pay amounts due on december   a default judgment was entered against the company in the amount of  plus interest and attorney fees the company has included the impact of this litigation as a liability in its accounts payable the company will seek to settle the default judgment when it has the financial resources to do so        ● torrey hills capital inc “torrey” notified the company by letter dated august   of its demand for the payment of  which it alleged was unpaid and owed under a consulting agreement dated october   the parties entered into a consulting agreement under which torrey agreed to provide investor relations

written notice by either party the company made payments totaling  and issued  shares of common stock during  the company contends that torrey breached the agreement by not performing the required services and that it had provided proper notice of termination to torrey furthermore the company contends that the parties agreed to settle the dispute on or about june   under which it would issue  shares of common stock in full settlement of any balance then owed and final termination of the agreement torrey disputed the company’s contentions and submitted the dispute to binding arbitration the company was unable to defend itself and the arbitration panel awarded torrey a total of  in damages the company has accrued amounts in accounts payable as of march   and december   which management believes is sufficient to provide for the ultimate resolution of this dispute   note  – related party transactions   the company does not have any employees other than the ceo and cfo in previous years certain general and administrative services for which payment is deferred had been provided by the cfo’s accounting firm at its standard billing rates plus outofpocket expenses consisting primarily of accounting tax and other administrative fees the company no longer utilizes the cfo’s accounting for such support services and was not billed for any such services during the three months ended march   and  the amount due to the cfo’s firm for services previously provided was  at march   and december   and is included in accrued liabilities at both dates   on june   the company entered into a revenue sharing agreement with the officers and directors for services provided infinity assigned to officers and directors a monthly payment equal to the revenue derived from one percent  of infinity’s share of the hydrocarbons produced at the wellhead from the nicaraguan concessions the rsp will bear its proportionate share of all costs incurred to deliver the hydrocarbons to the point of sale to an unaffiliated purchaser including its share of production severance and similar taxes and certain additional costs the rsp shall be paid by the last day of each month based on the revenue received by infinity from the purchaser of the production during the previous month from the nicaraguan concessions the revenue agreement does not create any obligation for infinity to maintain or develop the nicaraguan concessions and does not create any rights in the nicaraguan concessions for officers and directors   in connection with its subordinated loan offshore finance llc was granted a one percent  revenue sharing interest in the nicaraguan concessions in connection with a subordinated loan provided previously which was subsequently converted to common stock the managing partner of offshore and the company’s cfo are partners in the accounting firm which the company used for general corporate purposes in the past in connection with its dissolution offshore assigned its rsp to its

infinity’s president and chairman of the board serves as president and chairman of the board the facility is unsecured bears interest at  per annum and was renewed at its maturity several times with its current maturity date as may   in consideration for the origination of the line of credit facility and the various renewals the company granted the lender common stock purchase warrants on february   the company extended the lineofcredit expiration date to may   and issued a warrant to purchase  common shares at an exercise price of  per share which warrants were immediately exercisable and expire on february   the company estimated the fair value of the warrants at  as of the grant date which amount was recorded as debt issuance costs and will be amortized to interest expense over

including our december  in the original principal amount of  due in april  and the  million convertible note due may  which began amortizing in october  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet them iii we require working capital for our operations and obligations for the next  months and capital to continue our exploration and development efforts on the nicaraguan concessions including compliance with the letter of credit and other requirements of the nicaraguan concessions to maintain our rights under the applicable agreements and there can be no assurances we will be able to obtain it or do so on terms favorable to us iv we and our independent registered public accounting firm have concluded that there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern v our nicaraguan concessions and planned future exploration activities are in a country with a developing economy and are subject to the risks of political and economic instability associated with such economies vi exploration and development of our nicaraguan concessions will require large amounts of capital or a commercial relationship with an industry operator which we may not be able to obtain vii we may not have sufficient resources to conduct required seismic mapping on our nicaraguan concessions viii the oil and gas exploration business involves a high degree of business and financial risk ix we will be subject to regulations affecting our activities with the nicaraguan concessions x our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the fiscal regime of

q see note  – “nature of operations basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies” to the condensed financial statements for the three months ended march   and          operational and financial objectives   corporate activities   we hold a  working interest in any hydrocarbon deposits found under the perlas block  acres km and tyra block  acres km located in shallow waters offshore nicaragua the final approval of the eia by the nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on april   began subperiod  for both the tyra and perlas blocks as defined in the nicaraguan concessions we believe we have satisfied the acquisition processing and interpretation of seismic data required in subperiod  for both the perlas and tyra blocks therefore we are now in subperiod  of the exploration phase of the year concession for both perlas and tyra as of december   subperiod  of the nicaraguan concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block during  and the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block we are in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the perlas block as required in subperiod  and will have to perform supplemental eia work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the nicaraguan government the work plan on the tyra block for subperiod  requires us to shoot additional seismic which is estimated to cost approximately  prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling we are negotiating with the nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of such additional seismic mapping on the tyra block so that we can proceed with exploratory drilling there can be no assurance whether we will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement   during late december  we completed the d seismic survey activities in the area as required under both of the nicaraguan concessions at that point we believe that the newly acquired d seismic data together with the previously acquired reprocessed d seismic helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with d seismic in the eocene zone our geological consultants have estimated that these eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons principally oil in place in addition the new d seismic acquired in  provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the cretaceous zone which we could not evaluate using less precise older d seismic mapping we have identified multiple promising sites on the perlas block for exploratory drilling and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves given sufficient capital we believe that we have performed all work necessary as of december   to proceed to subperiod  for the perlas block as defined in the nicaraguan concessions which requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas concession within the following oneyear period we must first prepare and submit a supplemental eia to the nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the perlas block   we must prepare and submit the eia supplement to the nicaraguan government assuming that it does accept the supplemental eia and grant the drilling permit we will be required to drill at least one exploratory well on the perlas block during  or risk being in default and losing our rights under the nicaraguan concessions we do not believe that we will drill a well on the nicaraguan concessions during  given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets financing the drilling and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons we believe that we will be able to negotiate extensions with the nicaraguan government of the required date by which an exploratory well must be drilled however there can be no assurance in this regard   the company is in technical default of the nicaraguan concession because it has not provided the required letters of credit to the nicaraguan government in accordance with the nicaraguan concession agreements the company had previously provided the ministry of energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of  for perlas expired march  and  for tyra expired september  the company had also made all required expenditures related to the nicaraguan concessions for training programs and as “area fees” for each respective year for  through  the company is currently negotiating the renewal and increase of the required letters of credit which total  for the perlas block and  for the tyra block with the nicaraguan government and its lenders however there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in the regard the company considers it is fully in compliance with the terms of the nicaraguan concessions agreements except for the renewal of the expired letters of credit the foregoing items remain as substantial operational and legal issues that we must resolve in order to maintain our rights under the nicaraguan concessions during         we are also seeking offers from industry operators and other third parties for interests in the acreage in the nicaraguan concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other joint venture arrangement accordingly we intend to finance our business strategy through external financing which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings joint ventures sale of working or other interests employment of working capital and cash flow from operations if any and net proceeds from the sales of assets   our ability to complete these activities is dependent on a number of factors including but not limited to     ● the availability of the capital resources required to fund the activities         ● the availability of third party contractors for completion services and         ● the approval by regulatory agencies of applications for permits to conduct exploration activities in a timely manner   the company is considering the acquisition of domestic oil and gas properties with both proven and unproven reserves management believes that the current distressed state for oil and gas properties and the resulting decline in valuations may yield an opportunity for the company to accumulate undervalued oil and gas assets which will produce positive cash flows even with the decline in natural gas and crude oil commodity prices management believes that there may be financing available for such cash generating oil and gas properties at reasonable cost of capital especially when compared to the nicaraguan concessions which may yield higher returns but at higher risk levels this initiative may provide the company with positive cash flows to address immediate working capital needs while the environment improves for exploration projects such as the nicaraguan concessions although no assurances can be given in this regard   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions arrangements obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions changes in the financial conditions results of operations liquidity capital expenditures capital resources or significant components of revenue or expenses   for the three months ended march   and    results of operations as restated   revenue   the company had no revenues in either  or  as it focused solely on the exploration development financing and maintenance of the nicaraguan concessions   production and other operating expenses income   the company had no production related operating expenses in either  or  the company sold its investment in infinitytexas in july  and held no developed or undeveloped oil and gas properties in the united states in  and    the company has no current or planned domestic exploration and development activities at this time it is not actively working on any domestic property focusing instead on the exploration development and financing of the nicaraguan concessions   stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation expenses of  for the three months ended march   decreased  or  from the same period in  the company has had minimal resources to pay employees consultants and other service providers therefore it has issued stock options to compensate and motivate its officers directors and other service providers in previous years that vest generally over a two year time period the company did not grant any stock options during  and  the significant decrease in stockbased compensation expense during  compared to  is attributable to the full vesting of the january  stock option grant in january  which reduced the related amortization during the three months ended march   compared to  all outstanding stock options are fully vested as of march          general and administrative expenses   general and administrative expenses of  for the three months ended march   decreased  or  from  in the same period in  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease of  in delaware annual report and franchise taxes for  compared to  the delaware tax is based on our total assets which decreased substantially due to the impairment of our nicaraguan oil and gas properties during  the decrease was also attributable to an overall decrease in professional fees of  as the company engaged in fewer legal activities during the three months ended march   compared to  primarily due to the change in our stock transfer agent in early  for cost containment purposes reductions in general and administrative expenses were also attributable to us attending fewer investor conferences or similar forums during the three months ended march   compared to  which decreased such expenses by  the closing of the may  private placement reduced the need to incur additional costs related to capital raising and investor relations activities during the  period coupled with the poor investment climate for oil and gas companies during  and    interest expense   interest expense decreased from  for the three months ended march   to  for the  period this significant decrease is attributable to the company converting approximately  of its interest bearing debt to common stock during early  the company received loan proceeds of  from the senior convertible note issued in may  and  from two other convertible notes issued in july  all of which bear interest at  and remained outstanding at march   in previous years the company issued shortterm notes payable at various dates and extended their maturities by paying additional compensation to the lenders chiefly in the form of warrants the fair value of the warrants issued to the note holders at the origination and extension dates of the shortterm promissory notes was recorded as a discount on the related debt amortization of the value of the warrants and revenue sharing interests granted to the holders resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs during the three months ended march   compared to the same period in  discount amortization represents a noncash expense and totaled  and  of total interest expense recognized in the three months ended march   and  respectively   the company’s current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and customary financing terms unattainable therefore the company may find it necessary to continue with these types of shortterm borrowings with high effective interest rates        change in derivative fair value   the conversion feature of the promissory notes and the common stock purchase warrants issued in connection with shortterm notes and the senior convertible note outstanding during  and  are treated as derivative instruments because the promissory notes and warrants contain ratchet and antidilution provisions accordingly we adjusted the value of the outstanding derivative liabilities to their estimated fair value as of march   and  the marktomarket process resulted in a gain of  during the three months ended march   and a gain of  during the three months ended march   the decrease in the gain recognized is primarily the result of the lesser reduction in the closing market price of our common stock between the december    per share and march    per share compared to the corresponding period in  generally the fair value of the derivative liability declines when the market value of the underlying common stock decreases compared to the derivatives exercise price   change in fair value of convertible note   we issued the senior secured convertible note in the may  private placement and elected to account for and record such note on a fair value basis we received  of proceeds at the date of issuance and the fair market value of the senior convertible convertible note was estimated to be  as of december   and  at march   after considering principal repayments and additional funding received the net  change in fair market value of such note is included in the accompanying statement of operations for the three months ended march   no similar notes were outstanding during    income tax   for income tax purposes the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  as of december   which expire from  through  the company has provided a  valuation allowance against the resulting deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realizing the tax benefits from its net operating loss carryforwards   for the three months ended march   the company realized net losses the company anticipates operating losses and additional tax losses for the foreseeable future and does not believe that utilization of its tax loss carryforward is more likely than not therefore because of the uncertainty as to the ultimate utilization of the company’s loss carryforwards any deferred tax asset at march   that resulted from anticipated benefit from future utilization of such carryforward has been fully offset by a valuation allowance        net loss   as a result of the above we reported a net loss of  for the three months ended march   compared to a net loss of  for the three months ended march   this represents an improvement of     basic and diluted loss per share   basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weightedaverage number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants using the treasury stock and “if converted” method for periods in which net losses from continuing operations are incurred weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an antidilutive effect   the basic and diluted loss per share was  and  for the three months ended march   and  respectively for the reasons previously noted all outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase common stock were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the three months ended march   and  because of the exercise price of the warrants being substantially higher than market price in  and the net loss reported for  and  potential shares of common stock as of march   that have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share amounted to  shares which included  outstanding warrants and  outstanding stock options   liquidity and capital resources going concern   we have had a history of losses and have generated little or no operating revenues for a number of years as we concentrated on development of our nicaraguan concessions which is a longterm highriskreward exploration project in an otherwise unproven part of the world historically we financed our operations through the issuance of redeemable preferred stock and various short and longterm debt financing that contained some level of detachable warrants to provide the holder’s with a level of equity participation should the company be successful exploring its nicaraguan concessions   during  we borrowed approximately  on a shortterm basis by issuing various subordinated promissory notes with detachable warrants to purchase common shares the fair value of the warrants resulted in a substantial increase in the overall effective borrowing costs we used the proceeds of these notes to repay previously issued notes including the foregoing related party note to meet obligations and conduct seismic mapping related to our nicaraguan concessions and to provide working capital in addition we entered into an unsecured lineofcredit with a related party that supplemented its working capital needs and also provided detachable warrants to purchase common stock that increased the overall cost of the borrowing   in april  we conducted a private placement of units composed of common stock and warrants under which we raised  in proceeds and exchanged  principal amount of an outstanding note plus accrued interest for units we used part of these proceeds to retire notes issued earlier in    we were unable to raise longterm capital in  to pay the majority of the outstanding shortterm promissory notes on their respective maturity dates we were able to negotiate extensions of the maturity dates on these shortterm promissory notes by issuing additional warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock and in one case granting a revenue sharing interest in our nicaraguan concessions   in the first quarter  we were able to increase our lineofcredit to a maximum of  which provided us some liquidity but were unable to obtain other sources of capital on february   the shortterm note holders of maturing debt exercised their right to convert principal balances totaling  and accrued interest totaling  into  shares of common stock at an exchange rate of  per share in addition on march   the lender who provides the lineofcredit facility converted a partial principal balance totaling  into  shares of common stock at a price of  per share such debt to equity conversions helped to reduce our near term cash needs        in july  the company issued two promissory notes for total cash proceeds of  the promissory notes have maturity dates that have been extended several times and currently mature in august  in connection with the origination and extension of the notes the company issued warrants exercisable to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of  per share the warrants are immediately exercisable and terminate five years from their dates of issuance   on december   the company borrowed  under the december  note which is an unsecured credit facility with a private thirdparty lender effective april   the company and the lender agreed to extend the maturity date of the december  note from april   to the earlier of i april   or ii the payment in full of the investor note issued in the may  private placement in the principal amount of  the “new maturity date” all other terms of the note remained the same and the remaining principal balance was reduced to  as of march   after the  principal repayment required by the extension agreement   the december  note may be prepaid without penalty at any time the december  note is subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness as such terms are defined in the december  note the parties are attempting to negotiate an extension of the december  note which if completed will extend the maturity to april   although there can be no assurance in this regard   on may   the company completed the may  private placement of  million senior secured convertible note and a warrant exercisable to purchase  shares of the company’s common stock with an institutional investor at the closing of the may  private placement the investor acquired the convertible note by paying  in cash and issuing the investor note secured by cash with a principal amount of  assuming all amounts payable to the company under the investor note are paid the may  private placement will result in gross proceeds of  million before placement agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions the company used the initial proceeds from the closing to retire certain outstanding obligations including the  area and training fees of approximately  owed to the nicaraguan government relating to its nicaragua concessions and to provide additional working capital   the company will receive the remaining cash proceeds upon each voluntary or mandatory prepayment of the investor note the investor may at its option and at any time voluntarily prepay the investor note in whole or in part   the convertible note matures on the threeyear anniversary of its issuance bears interest at  per annum and is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into shares of the company’s common stock at  per share the “conversion price” as a part of the may  private placement the company issued a warrant to the investor giving it the right to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of the company’s common stock at an exercise price of  per share the warrant is exercisable commencing six months from the date of issuance for a period of seven years from the date of issuance   the investor has no right to convert the convertible note or exercise the warrant to the extent that such conversion or exercise would result in the investor being the beneficial owner of in excess of  of the company’s common stock the convertible note ranks senior to the company’s existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all of the assets of the company excluding the nicaraguan concessions   westpark capital acted as placement agent for the company in the may  private placement and received a fee of  of cash proceeds or  if and when the company receives the full cash proceeds it received  of such amount at the closing plus the reimbursement of legal fees totaling  the company also issued westpark a warrant exercisable to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of  per share the warrant was exercisable upon from the date of issuance for a period of seven years        in summary as of march   we owed i  on our lineofcredit which is due may   ii the two promissory notes in the total principal amount of  which are due in august  iii the senior secured convertible note with a fair value of  which is due in  monthly installment payments either in cash or stock and iv and the december  note in the principal amount of  which we are currently negotiating to extend the maturity to april  we intend to seek additional funding under the senior convertible note and other shortterm debt financing to provide the funds necessary to payoff the lineofcredit when it comes due and to provide working capital to fund normal operations although we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in this regard our current financial condition has made traditional bank loans and normal financing terms unattainable therefore we may find it necessary to continue with these types of shortterm borrowings with high effective interest rates   the company is in subperiod  of the exploration phase of the year concession for both perlas and tyra as of june   subperiod  of the nicaraguan concessions requires the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block during  and the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block the company is in process of identifying at least one potential drilling site on the perlas block as required in subperiod  and will have to perform supplemental eia work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the nicaraguan government the work plan on the tyra block for subperiod  requires the company to shoot additional seismic which is estimated to cost approximately  prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling the company is negotiating with the nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the tyra block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling there can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain a waiver of the requirement   in accordance with the nicaraguan concession agreements the company has previously provided the ministry of energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts of  for perlas expired march  and  for tyra expired september  the company has also made all required expenditures related to the nicaraguan concessions for training programs and as “area fees” for each respective year for  through  in accordance with the nicaraguan concession agreements the company must provide the ministry of energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts which total  for the perlas block and  for the tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases as required by the nicaraguan concessions to replace the expired letters of credit the minimum cash requirements to maintain and comply with the minimum work program as defined in the nicaraguan concessions for the next twelvemonth period will be approximately  for the perlas block which includes all costs to prepare for and drill the initial exploratory well and  for the tyra block assuming the waiver is granted regarding the seismic mapping if such waiver is not granted the company estimates it will require approximately  for the seismic mapping finally the company estimates it will need approximately  to prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the concessions   the company has identified multiple sites for exploratory drilling and is planning the initial exploratory wells in order to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves subject to receipt from the nicaraguan government of authorizations for the drilling of up to five wells in order to meet its obligations under the perlas block of the nicaraguan concession the company must drill its initial exploratory well during  or risk being in default and losing its rights under the nicaraguan concessions   we are negotiating the renewal andor adjustment of the required letters of credit with the nicaraguan government further we intend to seek a waiver of the d seismic mapping requirement because we do not believe it will be effective in providing additional information due the supplemental water depth and other factors we plan to prepare the necessary information to submit to the eia in order to obtain the necessary authorizations to drill up to five locations in the concessions there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any of the foregoing regards except for the foregoing items we believe we are in full compliance with the terms of the nicaraguan concessions agreements   the company must successfully comply with the restrictions related to the senior convertible note in order to release the remaining  million in funding under the investor note or it must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital in the immediate future in order to fund  the required letters of credit to the nicaraguan government  fund approximately  to prepare and submit an environmental supplement to the nicaraguan government to identify and receive authorization to drill up to five wells in the concessions  the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the perlas block of the nicaraguan concessions during   the shooting of additional seismic on the tyra block of the nicaraguan concessions if it is unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement form the nicaraguan government  the payment of normal daytoday operations and corporate overhead and  the payment of outstanding debt and financial obligations as they become due these are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during  or the company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its nicaragua concessions will be in significant doubt the company is actively seeking new outside sources of debt and equity capital in order fund the substantial needs enumerated above however there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the technical defaults existing on the nicaraguan concessions or to meet its ongoing requirements to drill the exploratory wells        in addition to the minimum cash requirements related to the nicaraguan concessions we estimate that we will require approximately  of working capital to maintain corporate operations for the next  months but not including approximately  principal amount of a shortterm promissory note due in april  subject to ongoing extension negotiations plus accrued interest the  principal due on the two promissory notes due in january  and the  currently outstanding under a revolving line of credit due february  we owe  in trade payables related to seismic activities already performed in december  but not yet paid however we believe such party has agreed to extend the time for payment of this obligation to until such time as we begin drilling operations on the nicaraguan concessions we also owe other obligations to third parties as noted on our balance sheet which we intend to pay negotiate andor settle prior to the beginning of any drilling operations although there is no assurance that will be able negotiate settlements with venders or avoid collection activities   we plan to raise longterm capital to satisfy the foregoing needs through an offering of our equity or debt securities andor through a commercial relationship with other industry operators which may involve the granting of revenue or other interests in the nicaraguan concessions in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or the creation of a joint venture or other strategic partnership there can be no assurance that we will obtain such funding or obtain it on terms acceptable to us further if we cannot meet our obligations respecting the nicaraguan concessions we may lose our rights to them   the company does not believe that it will be able to meet all of the nicaraguan concession requirements in  including proceeding to drill the required exploration well during  given the current state of the oil and gas commodity markets and the challenging economics for any new exploration and development project especially a project in an area of the world without historical proven reserves of commercial hydrocarbons the company believes that it will be able to negotiate extensions with the nicaraguan government relative to the required date by which any exploratory wells must be drilled as well as the other requirements for maintaining the concessions however there can be no assurance in this regard these are substantial operational and legal issues that the company must resolve in order to maintain its rights under the nicaraguan concessions during    due to the uncertainties related to these matters there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should we be unable to continue as a going concern   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable   item  controls and procedures   evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as of the date of the filing of our original form q on may   we conducted an

internal control over financial reporting discussed below our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of may   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis        changes in internal control over financial reporting   there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   internal control systems no matter how well designed and operated have inherent limitations therefore even a system which is determined to be effective cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues have been detected or prevented our systems of internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation   part ii  other information   item  legal proceedings   the company is currently involved in litigation as follows   ● in october  the state of texas filed a lawsuit naming infinitytexas the company and the corporate officers of infinitytexas seeking  of reclamation costs associated with a single well in addition to administrative expenses and penalties the company engaged in negotiations with the state of texas in late  and early  and reached a settlement agreement that would reduce the aggregate liability in this action and any extension of this to other texas wells to  which amount has been paid certain performance obligations remain which must be satisfied in order to finally settle and dismiss the matter       pending satisfactory performance of the performance obligations and their acceptance by the state of texas the officers have potential liability regarding the above matter and the officers are held personally harmless by indemnification provisions of the company therefore to extent they might actually occur these liabilities are the

fantastic customer support with management who really cares about you where i live there is a company that owns the gas pipes that infinite energy doesnt manage the actual workers of they just contract them or something well that company couldnt figure out what service area needed to service my place leading to delays in gas installation i spoke with several customer service reps and management with infinite energy because i was upset i took off work for no reason and they were absolutely doing the best they could to get me an eta even called me to keep me posted on the status of the work order and showed empathy on my behalf for the inconvenience would recommend this company any day of the week because they make you feel like you actually matter to them as a customer caroline cisneros   feb  glad to be back i definitely have to give praise to chris mola and his manager at infinite energy again this guy is a beast with product knowledge and always goes above and beyond to make sure i get the best service i was a customer for  years before i moved out of the service area and now i am back and happy to say ie is my electric provider again last friday i searched the powertochoose website to check out how ie rates compared to others to my surprise ie had a higher price then other competitors i called gexa energy since they were the lowest and spoke with julian and he offered me a plan for  cents avg per kwh after spending  mins on the phone with the guy he kept pushing me to sign up the guy made me feel uneasy and i called chris to see if he can beat the price chris took his time and walked me through the electricity facts label for that plan and come to find out the plan was crap absolute crap the real price after hidden fees was  cents avg per kwh which was way more than ies all inclusive rate of  cents avg per kwh chris than walked me through  other competitor company plans whose rates were  to  cents and again the real rates were really  cents and  cents chris than went over with me ies facts label so i could see the difference that ie had no hidden fees and he made sure i understood what i would be signing up for chris than took his time to help me break down some other competitor plans where they were closely to ies  cents we then found  other competitor plans with cirro energy and startrek or startek or starwars whatever you want to call it who chris confirmed had ies prices beat at  cents at this point chris has been on the phone with me for well over  minutes and he completely understood if i needed to go with the competitors plan he just advised me to call them and ask the right questions to make sure they had no extra fees not stated on their fact label so i called the starwars company and maria answered and literally it wasnt even a minute later where she sounded highly irritated and asked me to spell my name exactly as it appears on my social security card it was literally in that moment that i realized that i would rather pay an extra  a month to get the best customer service ever from chris and ie then to deal with maria and the sequel to star wars its definitely worth it to pay for quality i trust chris and owe him a big thank you chris you are a huge asset to ie and your sincerity and honesty is what makes this customer experience thee absolute best if you are searching for an electric providerinfinite energy is a must you cant beat what they do for their customers 🙂 jean derosa   feb  this was the most confusing thing ever to just have my name put on a new account kelsey and sandra were amazing and

energy drinks often mostly because they dont typically taste great and i drink coffee already however i was impressed with guru i couldnt put my finger on the flavor at first but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste kind of like matcha the nose is citrusy and refreshing that said although i stayed perky after drinking it i would say its safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too and if youre dead tired it might not make much of a difference it only has caffeine from the tea so not at all the crack type of artificial energy drink like a monster or red bull which i think taste gross and are horrible for you would you purchase again  yes original review mark w california this brand really holds up to the competition

and thought it was a step above the usual red bull or monster drinks upon reading the list of ingredients i was pleased to see that they were all natural i was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient which i felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements my store did not carry the sugar free variety so i had to settle for the  grams of sugar that came with the regular version it was very sweet but the actual taste was good and i liked the level of carbonation i didnt get the jitters nor did i have the crash and burn that i would have expected with this type of drink i did not drink it all at once but rather had it throughout the second half of the day which is usually when i start feeling tired if i can find the sugar free version i will definitely try

muracles  on lazy and rainy sunday afternoon i did not have much hope to achieve anything but with guru i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks the only thing to be aware of

purchase again  yes original review jack d california this product tastes great i absolutely loved it and felt very energetic about  minutes after drinking it it tastes great when chilled although i would think it probably tastes good at room temperature as well if i ever feel the need for some energy i would definitely purchase this product recommended would you purchase again  yes original review victoria h california i personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks i rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming although energy drinks can be considered a crutch its a lifestyle decision that many many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid i am one of these people that said guru energy is fairly cheap usdcan if you buy it here off amazon it comes in the redbull standard  floz cans and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case compare this to monster rockstar or any other brand with standard  floz cans the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape i think a particular good feature of guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup i appreciate a good quality soda particularly microbrew colas and they often exclusively contain cane sugar so in summary this energy drink is fairly cheap good buzz all natural and great for coding gaming or studying would you purchase again  yes original review sangeeta m california nice drink for a pickmeup  refreshing and pleasant tasting ideal replacement for a soda  the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying zero guilt would you purchase again  no original review ashley b california the biggest question is does it work the answer to your question is yes i was busy all day long and had the best energy ive had in awhile it feels a lot better than using redbull im very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy i have no question about that but this energy felt like ive slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever so pretty much i felt really good the taste isnt the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it its a little herbaly but not bad just different would you purchase again  yes original review christine f california i love it its sweet kind of tastes like this other energy drink brand ive tried before it tastes very good and not nasty or smell like alcohol like others do sure would rebuy again totally recommend this brand would you purchase again  yes original review cindy w california im a big fan of energy drinks so i consider myself somewhat of an expert and i must say this perticular energy drinkguru was quite surprising so if you get a chance to try one like i did please doyou wont be sorry trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review angela a california the taste was good i dont feel like it gave me more energy but it tasted good it was a good size as well would recommend and buy again for sure would you purchase

sugar content then dont get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too the can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like im not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic the product isnt priced the most competitively but maybe that is because i purchased it at bristol farms i wouldnt be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less i enjoyed my guru chilled but i totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature overall im happy with my guru experience would you purchase again  yes original review eliazar r

energy drink i have tried still not my favorite flavor but not bad i love that it is organic and does not have all of the artificial ingredients many other energy drinks have would you purchase again  yes original review valerie f california i dont usually buy traditional energy drinks because i prefer clean ingredients this guru energy drink is very clean its organic too and has very low calories i actually liked the taste a lot better than i thought i would but you can definitely taste the stevia its a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out i did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work id probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunchearly afternoon at work would you purchase again  yes original review courtney s california i really enjoyed the sustained healthy energy this drink provided other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin b like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary which causes an energy crash this one takes a more natural approach the result is a productive pep that does not make you feel or seem like youre on crack and it doesnt cause a sudden drop in energy either the energizing ingredients are green tea extract guarana seed and ginseng there is also echinacea which is great for the immune system at first i found the stevia to be overwhelming but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping i have a suspicion i would like the nonlite version a bit more but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia would you purchase again  yes original review laura w california this seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it it has no color and has a light refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste without being too much it has natural organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols erythritol etc which usually cause me problems i therefore felt a nice natural energy boost without any discomfort loved it would you purchase again  yes original review alison e california it was easy to drink and i really like that the ingredients are organic the flavor is good with a slight vitamin aftertaste it has comparable amounts of caffeine to other brands of energy drinks with nonnatural ingredients overall it tasted good and i would buy it again would you purchase again  yes original review sheila t kansas while i occasionally consume energy drinks i often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that i can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize i wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products and im also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste as such i was really interested in learning about and trying out guru organic energy which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine given that i avoid calories in drinks i chose the lite version to try and i was pleasantly surprised the flavor was different and although i wouldnt say it was delicious it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks ive tried i didnt feel a huge kick of energy but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and i did feel alert if not energetic overall i think the guru organic energy drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients although im not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks the next time i want one i will choose guru organic trynatural would you purchase again  yes original review ashley z california surprisingly good i wasnt expecting this drink to be lightly carbonatedit was a nice surprise flavor was good and it definitely gave noticeable energy i tried it before a workout in place of my preworkout drink i wouldnt replace my preworkout supplement it gave me a less focused energy but i would drink it if i needed a little pick me up throughout the day would you purchase again  yes original review phyllis c california i love the fruity fizzy taste and the amazing list of organic and natural ingredients best of all it doesnt give me the jitters like coffee would i could concentrate and get a lot of work done as im trying to eat clean and stay away from sugar an unsweetened version would be awesome as it is im pretty happy with guru energy drink would you purchase again  yes original review stephany c california i got the original guru and what i liked about this drink was that it didnt taste like a energy drink it was light and it didnt have that strong caffeine aftertaste the price is reasonable for bein g a usda verified drino which i think is very important i have already told my friends who lik energy drinks and they sell this product at my local bristol farms which is great thanks for the drink would you purchase again  yes original review tirza v california great taste and good energy level i did not feel jittery or have a crash afterwards like i have experienced with other products so glad theres no

the sparkling water blended with the organic ingredients of cane sugargrape juicecitric and apple acid along with the vital nutrients of organic green tea leafguarana seedechinacea flower and panax

unlike most stevia sweetened drinks the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste theres a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is onpoint i dont usually drink energy drinks but this one is an exception to the rule its organic low calorie nongmo and contains ingredients that i can actually trust another big bonus i noticed is that i did not experience a crash afterwards i read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturallyoccurring caffeine from green tea and guarana i dont know why you would drink any other energy drink than this definitely loading up on these again soon would you purchase again  yes original review rebecca h california this product is packed with good natural ingredients unlike most energy drinks out there and still packs the same amount of caffeine the flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks which i didnt mind i have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me however i did not have the same issues with this drink i really enjoyed it if there is one thing i could say about it is there wasnt any selection at the store i went to they had one flavor of the drink in one size the drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks i would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multipack with a small discount would you purchase again  yes original review debbie z california good taste and no jittery feeling i will definitely recommend this drink to my friends only problem is that it should be

good tasting product the thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull but with a more pleasing aftertaste it reminded me of cane sugar soda but much healthier there are g of

red bull fan but i got to try the guru energy drink it tastes a bit better than red bull but the crashes are way weaker the price is cheaper than red bull there are basically no downsides when compared to other energy drinks all in all  would buy again would you purchase again  yes original review flora r california this has to be the best energy drink that i have ever tasted it is a light crisp tangy citrus flavor that doesnt have a large aftertaste and gives me enough energy in the morning on my slow days would you purchase again  yes original review sophia h california i dont usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and i get shaky but with half a can of this drink i didnt feel overcaffeinated i liked that it is low in calories and organic but that also limits where i can buy it in the future i dont usually shop at sprouts or whole foods so this would only be something i would get when i rarely make it into those stores would you purchase again  yes original review laura c california the taste like gurus website describes is very indescribable it is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation the caffeine buzz is more natural it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out which is arguably awesome too in its own respect then big crash sort of feeling this is because the caffeine in guru is derived from mg of guaranine guarana herb rather than synthetically separated then added there is no mention about how much of the mg of guaranine is real caffeine but since red bull checks in at mg  oz it seems that guru is in pretty good shape would you purchase again  yes original review mary c california i tried the lite version and it has a nice fruity taste it tastes much better than other energy drinks on the market the price in the market is comparable to other brands would you purchase again  yes original review keyvan a california the drink tastes very good but the package is too smallneeds to be much bigger and fatterlike the size of a monster drink but a bit bigger would you purchase again  yes original review claudia c california guru energy drink has a good taste is

review juliana n california i usually dont like energy drinks because i cant deal with the carbonation guru organic energy drink was a nice surprise because the carbonation isnt that bad  i actually

drinks every now and again i break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee but im not a big energy drink person i think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat this one surprisingly seemed to have neither of those it was fresh tasting if you can believe it and i found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it the one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink the energy it did supply however came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects and for that i am quite grateful i may not buy it often but next time i reach for an energy drink ill definitely reach for guru and i will not hesitate to suggest it to friends would you purchase again  yes
