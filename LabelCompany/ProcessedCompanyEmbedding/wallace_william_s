wallace family records show early members of the family as holding estates at riccarton tarbolton and auchincruive in kyle and stenton in east lothian they were vassals of james stewart th high steward of scotland as their lands fell within his territory wallaces brothers malcolm and john are known from other sources the origins of the wallace surname and its association with southwest scotland are also far from certain other than the names being derived from the old english wylisc pronounced wullish meaning foreigner or welshman it is possible that all the wallaces in the clyde area were medieval immigrants from wales but as the term was also used for local cumbricspeaking strathclyde welsh it seems equally likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being welsh due to their cumbric languagecitation needed political crisis in scotlandedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed august  learn how and when to remove this template message main article competitors for the crown of scotland coronation of alexander when wallace was growing up king alexander iii ruled scotland his reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability on  march  however alexander died after falling from his horse the heir to the throne was alexanders granddaughter margaret maid of norway as she was still a child and in norway the scottish lords set up a government of guardians margaret fell ill on the voyage to scotland and died in orkney on  september  the lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the great cause with several families laying claim to the throne with scotland threatening to descend into civil war king edward i of england was invited in by the scottish nobility to arbitrate before the process could begin he insisted that all of the contenders recognize him as lord paramount of scotland in early november  at a great feudal court held in the castle at berwickupontweed judgment was given in favour of john balliol having the strongest claim in law edward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the scottish lords and even summoned king john balliol to stand before the english court as a common plaintiff john was a weak king known as toom tabard or empty coat john renounced his homage in march  and by the end of the month edward stormed berwickupontweed sacking the thenscottish border town in april the scots were defeated at the battle of dunbar in east lothian and by july edward had forced john to abdicate edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some  scottish nobles many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time silent years prior to the wars of independenceedit wallace depicted in a childrens history book from  some historians such as andrew fisher believe wallace must have had some earlier military experience in order to lead a successful military campaign in  campaigns like edward i of englands wars in wales might have provided a good opportunity for a younger son of a landholder to become a mercenary soldier wallaces personal seal bears the archers insignia so he may have fought as an archer in edwards army walter bower states that wallace was a tall man with the body of a giant  with lengthy flanks  broad in the hips with strong arms and legs  with all his limbs very strong and firm blind harrys wallace reaches seven feet start of the uprisingedit wallace statue by d w stevenson on the scottish national portrait gallery edinburgh the first act definitely known to have been carried out by wallace was his assassination of william de heselrig the english high sheriff of lanark in may  he then joined with william the hardy lord of douglas and they carried out the raid of scone this was one of several rebellions taking place across scotland including those of several scottish nobles and andrew moray in the north the uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the english at irvine in july wallace and moray were not involved and continued their rebellions wallace used the ettrick forest as a base for raiding and attacked wisharts palace at ancrum wallace and moray met and joined their forces possibly at the siege of dundee in early september battle of stirling bridgeedit main article battle of stirling bridge the later stirling bridge on  september  an army jointly led by wallace and andrew moray won the battle of stirling bridge although vastly outnumbered the scottish army routed the english army john de warenne th earl of surreys feudal army of  cavalry and  to  infantry met disaster as they crossed over to the north side of the river the narrowness of the bridge prevented many soldiers from crossing together possibly as few as three men abreast so while the english soldiers crossed the scots held back until half of them had passed and then killed the english as quickly as they could cross the infantry were sent on first followed by heavy cavalry the scots schiltron formations forced the infantry back into the advancing cavalry a pivotal charge led by one of wallaces captains caused some of the english soldiers to retreat as others pushed forward and under the overwhelming weight the bridge collapsed and many english soldiers drowned thus the scots won a significant victory boosting the confidence of their army hugh cressingham edwards treasurer in scotland died in the fighting and it is reputed that his body was subsequently flayed and the skin cut into small pieces as tokens of the victory the lanercost chronicle records that wallace had a broad strip of cressingham’s skin  taken from the head to the heel to make therewith a baldrick for his sword after the battle moray and wallace assumed the title of guardians of the kingdom of scotland on behalf of king john balliol moray died of wounds suffered on the battlefield sometime in late  the type of engagement conducted by wallace was characterized by opportunistic tactics and the strategic use of terrain this was in stark contrast to the contemporary views on chivalric warfare which were characterized by strength of arms and knightly combat therefore the battle embittered relations between the two antagonistic nations whilst also perhaps providing a new departure in the type of warfare which england had hitherto employed the numerical and material inferiority of the scottish forces was later mirrored by that of the english in the hundred years war who in turn abandoned chivalric warfare to achieve decisive victory in similar engagements such as crécy and poitiers around november  wallace led a largescale raid into northern england through northumberland and cumberland in a ceremony at the kirk o the forest selkirk towards the end of the year wallace was knighted this would have been carried out by one of three scottish earls — carrick strathearn or lennox battle of falkirkedit main article battle of falkirk william wallace statue aberdeen in april  edward ordered a second invasion of scotland two days prior to the battle  foot soldiers were paid more than half of them would have been welsh there are no clear cut sources for the presence of cavalry but it is safe to assume that edward had roughly  horse under his command they plundered lothian and regained some castles but failed to bring william wallace to combat the scots shadowed the english army intending to avoid battle until shortages of supplies and money forced edward to withdraw at which point the scots would harass his retreat the english quartermasters failure to prepare for the expedition left morale and food supplies low and a resulting riot within edwards own army had to be put down by his cavalry in july while planning a return to edinburgh for supplies edward received intelligence that the scots were encamped nearby at falkirk and he moved quickly to engage them in the pitched battle he had long hoped for wallace arranged his spearmen in four schiltrons — circular defensive hedgehog formations probably surrounded by wooden stakes connected with ropes to keep the infantry in formation the english however employed welsh longbowmen who swung strategic superiority in their favour the english proceeded to attack with cavalry and put the scottish archers to flight the scottish cavalry withdrew as well due to its inferiority to the english heavy horse edwards men began to attack the schiltrons which were still able to inflict heavy casualties on the english cavalry it remains unclear whether the infantry shooting bolts arrows and stones at the spearmen proved the deciding factor although it is very likely that it was the arrows of edwards bowmen gaps in the schiltrons soon appeared and the english exploited these to crush the remaining resistance the scots lost many men including john de graham wallace escaped though his military reputation suffered badly by september  wallace resigned as guardian of scotland in favour of robert the bruce earl of carrick and future king and john iii comyn lord of badenoch king john balliols nephew details of wallaces activities after this are vague but there is some evidence that he left on a mission to the court of king philip iv of france to plead the case for assistance in the scottish struggle for independence there is a surviving letter from the french king dated  november  to his envoys in rome demanding that they should help sir william it also suggests that wallace may have intended to travel to rome although it is not known if he did there is also a report from an english spy at a meeting of scottish leaders where they said wallace was in france by  wallace was back in scotland and involved in skirmishes at happrew and earnside capture and executionedit wallaces trial in westminster hall painting by daniel maclise wallace evaded capture by the english until  august  when john de menteith a scottish knight loyal to edward turned wallace over to english soldiers at robroyston near glasgow letters of safe conduct from haakon v of norway philip iv of france and john balliol along with other documents were found in wallaces possession and delivered to edward by john de segrave wallace was transported to london lodged in the house of william de leyrer then taken to westminster hall where he was tried for treason and for atrocities against civilians in war sparing neither age nor sex monk nor nun he was crowned with a garland of oak to suggest he was the king of outlaws he responded to the treason charge i could not be a traitor to edward for i was never his subject plaque marking the place of wallaces execution following the trial on  august  wallace was taken from the hall to the tower of london then stripped naked and dragged through the city at the heels of a horse to the elms at smithfield he was hanged drawn and quartered — strangled by hanging but released while he was still alive emasculated eviscerated and his bowels burned before him beheaded then cut into four parts his preserved head dipped in tar was placed on a pike atop london bridge it was later joined by the heads of the brothers john and simon fraser his limbs were displayed separately in newcastle berwick stirling and perth a plaque stands in a wall of st bartholomews hospital near the site of wallaces execution at smithfield in  the wallace monument was erected very close to the site of his victory at stirling bridge the wallace sword which supposedly belonged to wallace although some parts were made at least  years later was held for many years in dumbarton castle and is now in the wallace monument historiography of wallaceedit the wallace monument near stirling bridge although there are problems with writing a satisfactory biography of many medieval people the problems with wallace are greater than usual not much is known about him beyond his military campaign of – and the last few weeks of his life in  even in recent years his birthplace and his fathers name have been disputed to compound this the legacy of subsequent biographical accounts sometimes written as propaganda other times simply as entertainment has clouded much scholarship until relatively recent times some accounts have uncritically copied elements from the epic poem the acts and deeds of sir william wallace knight of elderslie written around  by blind harry the minstrel harry wrote from oral tradition describing events  years earlier and is not in any sense an authoritative descriptor of wallaces exploits much of the poem is clearly at variance with known historical facts and records of the period and is either fabricated using traditional chivalric motifs or borrowed from the exploits of others and attributed to wallace in popular cultureedit filmedit a wellknown account of wallaces life is presented in the film braveheart  directed by and starring mel

found on a letter written on th day of october  to the mayor of lübeck germany statue of wallace at edinburgh castle william wallace was a member of the lesser nobility but little is definitely known of his family history or even his parentage blind harrys latethcentury poem gives his father as sir malcolm of elderslie however williams own seal found on a letter sent to the hanse city of lübeck in  gives his fathers name as alan wallace this alan wallace may be the same as the one listed in the  ragman rolls as a crown tenant in ayrshire but there is no additional confirmation blind harrys assertion that william was the son of sir malcolm of elderslie has given rise to a tradition that williams birthplace was at elderslie in renfrewshire and this is still the view of some historians including the historical william wallace society itself however williams seal has given rise to a counter claim of ellerslie in ayrshire there is no contemporary evidence linking him with either location although both areas had connections with the wider wallace family records show early members of the family as holding estates at riccarton tarbolton and auchincruive in kyle and stenton in east lothian they were vassals of james stewart th high steward of scotland as their lands fell within his territory wallaces brothers malcolm and john are known from other sources the origins of the wallace surname and its association with southwest scotland are also far from certain other than the names being derived from the old english wylisc pronounced wullish meaning foreigner or welshman it is possible that all the wallaces in the clyde area were medieval immigrants from wales but as the term was also used for local cumbricspeaking strathclyde welsh it seems equally likely that the surname refers to people who were seen as being welsh due to their cumbric languagecitation needed political crisis in scotlandedit this section needs additional citations for verification please help

the crown of scotland coronation of alexander when wallace was growing up king alexander iii ruled scotland his reign had seen a period of peace and economic stability on  march  however alexander died after falling from his horse the heir to the throne was alexanders granddaughter margaret maid of norway as she was still a child and in norway the scottish lords set up a government of guardians margaret fell ill on the voyage to scotland and died in orkney on  september  the lack of a clear heir led to a period known as the great cause with several families laying claim to the throne with scotland threatening to descend into civil war king edward i of england was invited in by the scottish nobility to arbitrate before the process could begin he insisted that all of the contenders recognize him as lord paramount of scotland in early november  at a great feudal court held in the castle at berwickupontweed judgment was given in favour of john balliol having the strongest claim in law edward proceeded to reverse the rulings of the scottish lords and even summoned king john balliol to stand before the english court as a common plaintiff john was a weak king known as toom tabard or empty coat john renounced his homage in march  and by the end of the month edward stormed berwickupontweed sacking the thenscottish border town in april the scots were defeated at the battle of dunbar in east lothian and by july edward had forced john to abdicate edward then instructed his officers to receive formal homage from some  scottish nobles many of the rest being prisoners of war at that time silent years prior to the wars of independenceedit wallace depicted in a childrens history book from  some historians such as andrew fisher believe wallace must have had some earlier military experience in order to lead a successful military campaign in  campaigns like edward i of englands wars in wales might have provided a good opportunity for a younger son of a landholder to become a mercenary soldier wallaces personal seal bears the archers insignia so he may have fought as an archer in edwards army walter bower states that wallace was a tall man with the body of a giant  with lengthy flanks  broad in the hips with strong arms and legs  with all his limbs very strong and firm blind harrys wallace reaches seven feet start of the uprisingedit wallace statue by d w stevenson on the scottish national portrait gallery edinburgh the first act definitely known to have been carried out by wallace was his assassination of william de heselrig the english high sheriff of lanark in may  he then joined with william the hardy lord of douglas and they carried out the raid of scone this was one of several rebellions taking place across scotland including those of several scottish nobles and andrew moray in the north the uprising suffered a blow when the nobles submitted to the english at irvine in july wallace and moray were not involved and continued their rebellions wallace used the ettrick forest as a base for raiding and attacked wisharts palace at ancrum wallace and moray met and joined their forces possibly at the siege of dundee in early september battle of stirling bridgeedit main article battle of stirling bridge the later stirling bridge on  september  an army jointly led by wallace and andrew moray won the battle of stirling bridge although vastly outnumbered the scottish army routed the english army john de warenne th earl of surreys feudal army of  cavalry and  to  infantry met disaster as they crossed over to the north side of the river the narrowness of the bridge prevented many soldiers from crossing together possibly as few as three men abreast so while the english soldiers crossed the scots held back until half of them had passed and then killed the english as quickly as they could cross the infantry were sent on first followed by heavy cavalry the scots schiltron formations forced the infantry back into the advancing cavalry a pivotal charge led by one of wallaces captains caused some of the english soldiers to retreat as others pushed forward and under the overwhelming weight the bridge collapsed and many english soldiers drowned thus the scots won a significant victory boosting the confidence of their army hugh cressingham edwards treasurer in scotland died in the fighting and it is reputed that his body was subsequently flayed and the skin cut into small pieces as tokens of the victory the lanercost chronicle records that wallace had a broad strip of cressingham’s skin  taken from the head to the heel to make therewith a baldrick for his sword after the battle moray and wallace assumed the title of guardians of the kingdom of scotland on behalf of king john balliol moray died of wounds suffered on the battlefield sometime in late  the type of engagement conducted by wallace was characterized by opportunistic tactics and the strategic use of terrain this was in stark contrast to the contemporary views on chivalric warfare which were characterized by strength of arms and knightly combat therefore the battle embittered relations between the two antagonistic nations whilst also perhaps providing a new departure in the type of warfare which england had hitherto employed the numerical and material inferiority of the scottish forces was later mirrored by that of the english in the hundred years war who in turn abandoned chivalric warfare to achieve decisive victory in similar engagements such as crécy and poitiers around november  wallace led a largescale raid into northern england through northumberland and cumberland in a ceremony at the kirk o the forest selkirk towards the end of the year wallace was knighted this would have been carried out by one of three scottish earls — carrick strathearn or lennox battle of falkirkedit main article battle of falkirk william wallace statue aberdeen in april  edward ordered a second invasion of scotland two days prior to the battle  foot soldiers were paid more than half of them would have been welsh there are no clear cut sources for the presence of cavalry but it is safe to assume that edward had roughly  horse under his command they plundered lothian and regained some castles but failed to bring william wallace to combat the scots shadowed the english army intending to avoid battle until shortages of supplies and money forced edward to withdraw at which point the scots would harass his retreat the english quartermasters failure to prepare for the expedition left morale and food supplies low and a resulting riot within edwards own army had to be put down by his cavalry in july while planning a return to edinburgh for supplies edward received intelligence that the scots were encamped nearby at falkirk and he moved quickly to engage them in the pitched battle he had long hoped for wallace arranged his spearmen in four schiltrons — circular defensive hedgehog formations probably surrounded by wooden stakes connected with ropes to keep the infantry in formation the english however employed welsh longbowmen who swung strategic superiority in their favour the english proceeded to attack with cavalry and put the scottish archers to flight the scottish cavalry withdrew as well due to its inferiority to the english heavy horse edwards men began to attack the schiltrons which were still able to inflict heavy casualties on the english cavalry it remains unclear whether the infantry shooting bolts arrows and stones at the spearmen proved the deciding factor although it is very likely that it was the arrows of edwards bowmen gaps in the schiltrons soon appeared and the english exploited these to crush the remaining resistance the scots lost many men including john de graham wallace escaped though his military reputation suffered badly by september  wallace resigned as guardian of scotland in favour of robert the bruce earl of carrick and future king and john iii comyn lord of badenoch king john balliols nephew details of wallaces activities after this are vague but there is some evidence that he left on a mission to the court of king philip iv of france to plead the case for assistance in the scottish struggle for independence there is a surviving letter from the french king dated  november  to his envoys in rome demanding that they should help sir william it also suggests that wallace may have intended to travel to rome although it is not known if he did there is also a report from an english spy at a meeting of scottish leaders where they said wallace was in france by  wallace was back in scotland and involved in skirmishes at happrew and earnside capture and executionedit wallaces trial in westminster hall painting by daniel maclise wallace evaded capture by the english until  august  when john de menteith a scottish knight loyal to edward turned wallace over to english soldiers at robroyston near glasgow letters of safe conduct from haakon v of norway philip iv of france and john balliol along with other documents were found in wallaces possession and delivered to edward by john de segrave wallace was transported to london lodged in the house of william de leyrer then taken to westminster hall where he was tried for treason and for atrocities against civilians in war sparing neither age nor sex monk nor nun he was crowned with a garland of oak to suggest he was the king of outlaws he responded to the treason charge i could not be a traitor to edward for i was never his subject plaque marking the place of wallaces execution following the trial on  august  wallace was taken from the hall to the tower of london then stripped naked and dragged through the city at the heels of a horse to the elms at smithfield he was hanged drawn and quartered — strangled by hanging but released while he was still alive emasculated eviscerated and his bowels burned before him beheaded then cut into four parts his preserved head dipped in tar was placed on a pike atop london bridge it was later joined by the heads of the brothers john and simon fraser his limbs were displayed separately in newcastle berwick stirling and perth a plaque stands in a wall of st bartholomews hospital near the site of wallaces execution at smithfield in  the wallace monument was erected very close to the site of his victory at stirling bridge the wallace sword
