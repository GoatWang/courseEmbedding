to steeledit blue bird number  built on a  ford model tt chassis donated to the henry ford museum in  as the second quarter of the th century began albert luce sr was one of the entrepreneurs of the period who transitioned from building wagons to developing some of the earliest purposebuilt school buses what is now blue bird corporation began life as a side project in a ford motor company dealership in perry georgia along with the dealership in perry luce owned the ford franchise in fort valley georgia a rural farming community south of macon in  luce had sold a customer a ford model t with a wooden bus body the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural georgia roads the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads in place of wood luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheetmetal wood was used as a secondary material completed in  the bus was put into use as a school bus while buses would initially remain a side project for luce with only  bus bodies produced between  and  the onset of the great depression would make a change in his company forever following a  decline in car sales in  luce sold both of his ford dealerships using the  proceeds from the sale to begin his own company concentrating solely on bus production inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools the early use of farm wagons on a parttime basis soon evolved into purposebuilt school bus products each with economy and function as major priorities in  the company began production of fullsteel bus bodies an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the united states in a  conference blue bird engineers helped to develop the color school bus yellow which is still in use today during world war ii bus production was largely diverted to the armed forces with blue bird producing buses and mobile ambulances due to rationing of steel company engineers were forced to reengineer several body assemblies to minimize use of steel by the end of the war increased bus production lead blue bird school buses to come into use in many school districts in the southern us outside of georgia – postwar transitionedit following world war ii the configuration of schools throughout the united states continued to change in rural communities school districts transitioned away from schoolhouses towards centralized schools sharing the graded class structures of urban schools while urban populations moved into suburbs depending on location the previous practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical particularly as students progressed into high school in both rural and suburban school districts the addition of the babyboom generation lead to a new demand for school transportation near the end of  blue bird would see its factory in fort valley georgia destroyed by fire forcing the company to build a new facility though the factory building was destroyed a

were produced they were built on locally sourced chassis from mercedesbenz hino nissan diesel and toyota company founder al luce died in  shortly after the three luce sons sought to diversify the company product line fearing that the school bus industry whose demand was influenced by the baby boom generation would eventually drop off as students completed their education at the beginning of

and heads of state among their owners in the s blue bird developed a bus for a much wider audience named the city bird it was a variant of the all american developed for the masstransit segment a shortwheelbase rearengine bus the city bird was intended for smaller cities and routes with culdesac ends providing better maneuverability and more efficient costs than larger vehicles during the s

many of the predictions of the luce brothers had largely come true as the babyboom generation completed their secondary education by the end of the s student populations a key factor in school bus sales for nearly three decades began to decline coupled with the fragile economy of the time three of the six largest school bus manufacturers carpenter superior and ward would file for bankruptcy in the early s with superior exiting school bus production entirely the recession of the early s cut deeply into profits leading to the reorganization or closure of several manufacturers blue bird fared better than most competitors becoming the largest manufacturer in terms of sales by the mids one out of every three new school buses was a blue bird a key factor to the sales expansion was the renewal of the blue bird product line at the end of the decade in  the company made two product introductions that would change the company due to increasing demand the company began inhouse production of rearengine chassis for the all american for the first time previously it was outsourced to other manufacturers also that year the company expanded the transitstyle school bus line from one to two with the introduction of the tc largely a response to the wayne lifestar the tc was developed in an effort to secure bids from operators of large fleets it was designed with a purchase price nearly in line with conventionalstyle bus however unlike competitors it was also designed with an inhouse chassis like the all american the tc was a runaway success by  nearly  in  new school buses was of the type

production in  blue bird launched the qbus a  wide bus transit and charter applications unlike the city bird the qbus was not based upon any version of the all american during the s blue bird launched commercial versions of the all american and tc called the apc and csseries the buses were also sold in shell versions for upfitters as well in the early s the wanderlodge began to transition away from its school bus origins while still a heavyduty coach built largely to order the wanderlodge was redesigned to allow it to be built with a  wide body while the width was illegal for a school bus it had been allowed in motorcoaches and some competing motorhomes for some time additionally the change allowed blue bird to modernize the looks of vehicle in  blue bird introduced its first passenger

managers after the buyout the company name changed from blue bird body company to blue bird corporation during the s and early s declining demand for school buses and changes in world markets would lead to a number of changes at the company leading to several ownership changes in  the british henlys group plc purchased blue bird with a substantial financial stake held by volvo group the ownership changes during the late s led to a number of changes in blue bird production facilities in  the factory in buena vista virginia blue bird east was shut down in its place the company opened its first factory in mexico blue bird de mexico in monterrey nuevo león in  in  in an effort to supplement its product line blue bird entered into a supply agreement with its canadian bus manufacturer girardin minibus its distributor in the country to supply dealers in the united states with the newly designed mbiimbiv cutaway van branded as blue birds while similar to the micro bird the blue bird mbiiiv by girardin allowed blue bird to offer an updated body design along with a configuration based on a single rearwheel van chassis at the time girardin was the only school bus manufacturer that built a full cutaway body for a single rearwheel chassis the mbiiiv were sold by blue bird until  after redesigning its mediumduty truck line in  general motors entered into an year supply agreement

parts are then typically assembled into bodies which can be mounted onto chassis which have often been variations of those used in a myriad of truck applications productionwise the large home plant complex in fort valley georgia served as both a part manufacturing plant for the entire organization as well as one of the six locations where bodies were assembled from in house and purchased

the second quarter of the th century began albert luce sr was one of the entrepreneurs of the period who transitioned from building wagons to developing some of the earliest purposebuilt school buses what is now blue bird corporation began life as a side project in a ford motor company dealership in perry georgia along with the dealership in perry luce owned the ford franchise in fort valley georgia a rural farming community south of macon in  luce had sold a customer a ford model t with a wooden bus body the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural georgia roads the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads in place of wood luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheetmetal wood was used as a secondary material completed in  the bus was put into use as a school bus while buses would initially remain a side project for luce with only  bus bodies produced between  and  the onset of the great depression would make a change in his company forever following a  decline in car sales in  luce sold both of his ford dealerships using the  proceeds from the sale to begin his own company concentrating solely on bus production inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools the early use of farm wagons on a parttime basis soon evolved into purposebuilt school bus products each with economy and function as major priorities in  the company began production of fullsteel bus bodies an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the united states in a  conference blue bird engineers helped to develop the color school bus yellow which is still in use today during world war ii bus production was largely diverted to the armed forces with blue bird producing buses and mobile ambulances due to rationing of steel company engineers were forced to reengineer several body assemblies to minimize use of steel by the end of the war increased bus production lead blue bird school buses to come into use in many school districts in the southern us outside of georgia – postwar transitionedit following world war ii the configuration of schools throughout the united states continued to change in rural communities school districts transitioned away from schoolhouses towards centralized schools sharing the graded class structures of urban schools while urban populations moved into suburbs depending on location the previous practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical particularly as students progressed into high school in both rural and suburban school districts the addition of the babyboom generation lead to a new demand for school transportation near the end of  blue bird would see its factory in fort valley georgia destroyed by fire forcing the company to build a new facility though the factory building was destroyed a significant amount of equipment was salvaged allowing bus production to resume shortly afterward in the postwar period blue bird would grow substantially becoming one of the larger body manufacturers in the united states during the late s the leadership of blue bird changed company founder al luce

in  blue bird canada was opened in brantford ontario in  blue bird midwest was opened in mount pleasant iowa in  blue bird moved production beyond north america with blue bird central america in guatemala to lower production and maintenance costs while the conventional and all american bodies were produced they were built on locally sourced chassis from mercedesbenz hino nissan diesel and toyota company founder al luce died in  shortly after the three luce sons sought to diversify the company product line fearing that the school bus industry whose demand was influenced by the baby boom generation would eventually drop off as students completed their education at the beginning of the decade the blue bird company logo made its debut painted on the roofline of many of its buses in  the first major blue bird venture outside of school buses made its debut named the blue bird transit home rebranded wanderlodge in  it was a   in  dollars luxury recreational vehicle based on the all american using the heavyduty frame and allsteel body to its advantage the vehicle was marketed as higherquality than other rvs of the time the interior was largely built to order based on the all american for over  years the wanderlodge developed a loyal following including celebrities and heads of state among their owners in the s blue bird developed a bus for a much wider audience named the city bird it was a variant of the all american developed for the masstransit segment a shortwheelbase rearengine bus the city bird was intended for smaller cities and routes with culdesac ends providing better maneuverability and more efficient costs than larger vehicles during the s with the use of small school buses increasing blue bird found a way to diversify its school bus line while school buses based on cutaway vans were not invented by the company blue bird found ways to gain significant market share in  blue bird introduced the micro bird based on a dual rearwheel chevroletgmc van chassis largely similar to the wayne busette the micro bird distinguished itself by featuring a fullheight school bus door and additional windows forward of the entry door to aid loadingzone visibility in  the smallbus lineup was expanded to two with the debut of the mini bird based on the gm p stepvan chassis while still a small bus in its own right the mini bird was designed with the

article blue bird tc the late s and early s were a time of turmoil for school bus manufacturers many of the predictions of the luce brothers had largely come true as the babyboom generation completed their secondary education by the end of the s student populations a key factor in school bus sales for nearly three decades began to decline coupled with the fragile economy of the time three of the six largest school bus manufacturers carpenter superior and ward would file for bankruptcy in the early s with superior exiting school bus production entirely the recession of the early s cut deeply into profits leading to the reorganization or closure of several manufacturers blue bird fared better than most competitors becoming the largest manufacturer in terms of sales by the mids one out of every three new school buses was a blue bird a key factor to the sales expansion was the renewal of the blue bird product line at the end of the decade in  the company made two product introductions that would change the company due to increasing demand the company began inhouse production of rearengine chassis for the all american for the first time previously it was outsourced to other manufacturers also that year the company expanded the transitstyle school bus line from one to two with the introduction of the tc largely a response to the wayne lifestar the tc was developed in an effort to secure bids from operators of large fleets it was designed with a purchase price nearly in line with conventionalstyle bus however unlike competitors it was also designed with an inhouse chassis like the all american the tc was a runaway success by  nearly  in  new school buses was of the type introduced during  production blue bird made its first major changes to the all american since  along with major exterior updates there was an allnew powertrain lineup and a redesigned drivers compartment while blue bird had enjoyed major success during the s with school buses the company had mixed results with its masstransit products discontinuing the city bird in  after  years of production in  blue bird launched the qbus a  wide bus transit and charter applications unlike the city bird the qbus was not based upon any version of the all american during the s blue bird launched commercial versions of the all american and tc called the apc and csseries the buses were also sold in shell versions for upfitters as well in the early s the wanderlodge began to transition away from its school bus origins while still a heavyduty coach built largely to order the wanderlodge was redesigned to allow it to be built with a  wide body while the width was illegal for a school bus it had been allowed in motorcoaches and some competing motorhomes for some time additionally the change allowed blue bird to modernize the looks of vehicle in  blue bird introduced its first passenger motorcoach the ltc its first passenger motorcoach it became the donor platform for the

in california while the electric school bus remained a prototype blue bird has continued to offer cng as an option on the all american since its  introduction in  the envirobus  concept made its debut

company in a managementled buyout with the other  spread between paul glaske and  other blue bird managers after the buyout the company name changed from blue bird body company to blue bird corporation during the s and early s declining demand for school buses and changes in world markets would lead to a number of changes at the company leading to several ownership changes in  the british henlys group plc purchased blue bird with a substantial financial stake held by volvo group the ownership changes during the late s led to a number of changes in blue bird production facilities in  the factory in buena vista virginia blue bird east was shut down in its place the company opened its first factory in mexico blue bird de mexico in monterrey nuevo león in  in  in an effort to supplement its product line blue bird entered into a supply agreement with its canadian bus manufacturer girardin minibus its distributor in the country to supply dealers in the united states with the newly designed mbiimbiv cutaway van branded as blue birds while similar to the micro bird the blue bird mbiiiv by girardin allowed blue bird to offer an updated body design along with a configuration based on a single rearwheel van chassis at the time girardin was the only school bus manufacturer that built a full cutaway body for a single rearwheel chassis the mbiiiv were sold by

substantial update of the all american in  blue bird discontinued the slowselling tc in  and consolidated the tc with the all american early in  however the largest change came in  as blue bird sought to replace the cv while initially developed to use the ford f super duty chassis the vision underwent a major change before its release in a major break from precedent blue bird did not use an existing truck manufacturer for the chassis instead developing its own version from the ground up while the vision used the same bus body as the longrunning conventional engineering changes were made to optimize forward visibility as part of its acquisition by cerberus blue bird gradually saw itself positioned exclusively into yellow school bus production its largest market in  the xcel was

tt chassis donated to the henry ford museum in  as the second quarter of the th century began albert luce sr was one of the entrepreneurs of the period who transitioned from building wagons to developing some of the earliest purposebuilt school buses what is now blue bird corporation began life as a side project in a ford motor company dealership in perry georgia along with the dealership in perry luce owned the ford franchise in fort valley georgia a rural farming community south of macon in  luce had sold a customer a ford model t with a wooden bus body the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural georgia roads the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads in place of wood luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheetmetal wood was used as a secondary material completed in  the bus was put into use as a school bus while buses would initially remain a side project for luce with only  bus bodies produced between  and  the onset of the great depression would make a change in his company forever following a  decline in car sales in  luce sold both of his ford dealerships using the  proceeds from the sale to begin his own company concentrating solely on bus production inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools the early use of farm wagons on a parttime basis soon evolved into purposebuilt school bus products each with economy and function as major priorities in  the company began production of fullsteel bus bodies an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the united states in a  conference blue bird engineers helped to develop the color school bus yellow which is still in use today during world war ii bus production was largely diverted to the armed forces with blue bird producing buses and mobile ambulances due to rationing of steel company engineers were forced to reengineer several body assemblies to minimize use of steel by the end of the war increased bus production lead blue bird school buses to come into use in many school districts in the southern us outside of georgia – postwar transitionedit following world war ii the configuration of schools throughout the united states continued to change in rural communities school districts transitioned away from schoolhouses towards centralized schools sharing the graded class structures of urban schools while urban populations moved into suburbs depending on location the previous practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical particularly as students progressed into high school in both rural and suburban school districts the addition of the babyboom generation lead to a new demand for school transportation near the end of  blue bird would see its factory in fort valley georgia destroyed by fire forcing the company to build a new facility though the factory building was destroyed a significant amount of equipment was salvaged allowing bus production to resume shortly afterward in the postwar period blue bird would grow substantially becoming one of the larger body manufacturers in the united states during the late s the leadership of blue bird changed company founder al luce retired handing over operations to his three sons all americanedit main article blue bird all american blue bird founder albert luce sr viewed a design for a

to an rv as the s became the s blue bird grew rapidly becoming the fourthlargest manufacturer of school buses to accommodate the added demand the luce brothers added several production facilities to supplement the fort valley georgia plant in  blue bird canada was opened in brantford ontario in  blue bird midwest was opened in mount pleasant iowa in  blue bird moved production beyond north america with blue bird central america in guatemala to lower production and maintenance costs while the conventional and all american bodies were produced they were built on locally sourced chassis from mercedesbenz hino nissan diesel and toyota company founder al luce died in  shortly after the three luce sons sought to diversify the company product line fearing that the school bus industry whose demand was influenced by the baby boom generation would eventually drop off as students completed their education at the beginning of the decade the blue bird company logo made its debut painted on the roofline of many of its buses in  the first major blue bird venture outside of school buses made its debut named the blue bird transit home rebranded wanderlodge in  it was a   in  dollars luxury recreational vehicle based on the all american using the heavyduty frame and allsteel body to its advantage the vehicle was marketed as higherquality than other rvs of the time the interior was largely built to order based on the all american for over  years the wanderlodge developed a loyal following including celebrities and heads of state among their owners in the s blue bird developed a bus for a much wider audience named the city bird it was a variant of the all american developed for the masstransit segment a shortwheelbase rearengine bus the city bird was intended for smaller cities and routes with culdesac ends providing better maneuverability and more efficient costs than larger vehicles during the s with the use of small school buses increasing blue bird found a way to diversify its school bus line while school buses based on cutaway vans were not invented by the company blue bird found ways to gain significant market share in  blue bird introduced the micro bird based on a dual rearwheel chevroletgmc van chassis largely similar to the wayne busette the micro bird distinguished itself by featuring a fullheight school bus door and additional windows forward of the entry door to aid loadingzone visibility in  the smallbus lineup was expanded to two with the debut of the mini bird based on the gm p stepvan chassis while still a small bus in its own right the

in brooklyn new york main article blue bird tc the late s and early s were a time of turmoil for school bus manufacturers many of the predictions of the luce brothers had largely come true as the babyboom generation completed their secondary education by the end of the s student populations a key factor in school bus sales for nearly three decades began to decline coupled with the fragile economy of the time three of the six largest school bus manufacturers carpenter superior and ward would file for bankruptcy in the early s with superior exiting school bus production entirely the recession of the early s cut deeply into profits leading to the reorganization or closure of several manufacturers blue bird fared better than most competitors becoming the largest manufacturer in terms of sales by the mids one out of every three new school buses was a blue bird a key factor to the sales expansion was the renewal of the blue bird product line at the end of the decade in  the company made two product introductions that would change the company due to increasing demand the company began inhouse production of rearengine chassis for the all american for the first time previously it was outsourced to other manufacturers also that year the company expanded the transitstyle school bus line from one to two with the introduction of the tc largely a response to the wayne lifestar the tc was developed in an effort to secure bids from operators of large fleets it was designed with a purchase price nearly in line with conventionalstyle bus however unlike competitors it was also designed with an inhouse chassis like the all american the tc was a runaway success by  nearly  in  new school buses was of the type introduced during  production blue bird made its first major changes to the all american since  along with major exterior updates there was an allnew powertrain lineup and a redesigned drivers compartment while blue bird had enjoyed major success during the s with school buses the company had mixed results with its masstransit products discontinuing the city bird in  after  years of production in  blue bird launched the qbus a  wide bus transit and charter applications unlike the city bird the qbus was not based upon any version of the all american during the s blue bird launched commercial versions of the all american and tc called the apc and csseries the buses were also sold in shell versions for upfitters as well in the early s the wanderlodge began to transition away from its school bus origins while still a heavyduty coach built largely to order the wanderlodge was redesigned to allow it to be built with a  wide body while the width was illegal for a school bus it had been allowed in motorcoaches and some competing motorhomes for some time additionally the change allowed blue bird to modernize the looks of vehicle in  blue bird introduced its first passenger motorcoach the ltc its first passenger motorcoach it became the donor platform for the wanderlodge from  onwards environmentallyfriendly busesedit the s were also a period that the company explored the use of alternative power sources for school buses in  blue bird introduced the first school bus an all american rear engine powered by compressed natural gas cng in  blue bird developed a batterypowered school bus in an effort with westinghouse electronic systems for a school district in california while the electric school bus remained a prototype blue bird has continued to offer cng as an option on the all american since its  introduction in  the

partners purchased an  stake of the company in a managementled buyout with the other  spread between paul glaske and  other blue bird managers after the buyout the company name changed from blue bird body company to blue bird corporation during the s and early s declining demand for school buses and changes in world markets would lead to a number of changes at the company leading to several ownership changes in  the british henlys group plc purchased blue bird with a substantial financial stake held by volvo group the ownership changes during the late s led to a number of changes in blue bird production facilities in  the factory in buena vista virginia blue bird east was shut down in its place the company opened its first factory in mexico blue bird de mexico in monterrey nuevo león in  in  in an effort to supplement its product line blue bird entered into a supply agreement with its canadian bus manufacturer girardin minibus its distributor in the country to supply dealers in the united states with the newly designed mbiimbiv cutaway van branded as blue birds while similar to the micro bird the blue bird mbiiiv by girardin allowed blue bird to offer an updated body design along with a configuration based on a single rearwheel van chassis at the time girardin was the only school bus manufacturer that built a full cutaway body for a single rearwheel chassis the mbiiiv

familyrun companies school bus manufacturers were now owned by larger companies with ties to truck manufacturing for blue bird a large stake of the company was owned by the volvo group the largest bus manufacturer in the world however during the early s due to financial difficulties of its other parent company blue bird was sold from henlys in  in  blue bird was acquired through a bankruptcy filing by cerberus capital management looking to develop its entries in the transportation sector blue bird was paired with north american bus industries nabi and optima bus corporation by cerberus at the

decade following the substantial update of the all american in  blue bird discontinued the slowselling tc in  and consolidated the tc with the all american early in  however the largest change came in  as blue bird sought to replace the cv while initially developed to use the ford f super duty chassis the vision underwent a major change before its release in a major break from precedent blue bird did not use an existing truck manufacturer for the chassis instead developing its own version from the ground up while the vision used the same bus body as the longrunning conventional engineering changes were made to optimize forward visibility as part of its acquisition by cerberus blue bird gradually saw itself positioned exclusively into yellow school bus production its largest market in

historyedit – the change to steeledit blue bird number  built on a  ford model tt chassis donated to the henry ford museum in  as the second quarter of the th century began albert luce sr was one of the entrepreneurs of the period who transitioned from building wagons to developing some of the earliest purposebuilt school buses what is now blue bird corporation began life as a side project in a ford motor company dealership in perry georgia along with the dealership in perry luce owned the ford franchise in fort valley georgia a rural farming community south of macon in  luce had sold a customer a ford model t with a wooden bus body the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural georgia roads the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads in place of wood luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheetmetal wood was used as a secondary material completed in  the bus was put into use as a school bus while buses would initially remain a side project for luce with only  bus bodies produced between  and  the onset of the great depression would make a change in his company forever following a  decline in car sales in  luce sold both of his ford dealerships using the  proceeds from the sale to begin his own company concentrating solely on bus production inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools the early use of farm wagons on a parttime basis soon evolved into purposebuilt school bus products each with economy and function as major priorities in  the company began production of fullsteel bus bodies an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the united states in a  conference blue bird engineers helped to develop the color school bus yellow which is still in use today during world war ii bus production was largely diverted to the armed forces with blue bird producing buses and mobile ambulances due to rationing of steel company engineers were forced to reengineer several body assemblies to minimize use of steel by the end of the war increased bus production lead blue bird school buses to come into use in many school districts in the southern us outside of georgia – postwar transitionedit following world war ii the configuration of schools throughout the united states continued to change in rural communities school districts transitioned away from schoolhouses towards centralized schools sharing the graded class structures of urban schools while urban populations moved into suburbs depending on location the previous practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical particularly as students progressed into high school in both rural and suburban school districts the addition of the babyboom generation lead to a new demand for school transportation near the end of  blue bird would see its factory in fort valley georgia destroyed by fire forcing the company to build a new facility though the factory building was destroyed a significant amount of equipment was salvaged allowing bus production to resume shortly afterward in the postwar period blue bird would grow substantially becoming

bird  blue bird wanderlodge early s blue bird school bus with a chevrolet c chassis this bus is being converted to an rv as the s became the s blue bird grew rapidly becoming the fourthlargest manufacturer of school buses to accommodate the added demand the luce brothers added several production facilities to supplement the fort valley georgia plant in  blue bird canada was opened in brantford ontario in  blue bird midwest was opened in mount pleasant iowa in  blue bird moved production beyond north america with blue bird central america in guatemala to lower production and maintenance costs while the conventional and all american bodies were produced they were built on locally sourced chassis from mercedesbenz hino nissan diesel and toyota company founder al luce died in  shortly after the three luce sons sought to diversify the company product line fearing that the school bus industry whose demand was influenced by the baby boom generation would eventually drop off as students completed their education at the beginning of the decade the blue bird company logo made its debut painted on the roofline of many of its buses in  the first major blue bird venture outside of school buses made its debut named the blue bird transit home rebranded wanderlodge in  it was a   in  dollars luxury recreational vehicle based on the all american using the heavyduty frame and allsteel body to its advantage the vehicle was marketed as higherquality than other rvs of the time the interior was largely built to order based on the all american for over  years the wanderlodge developed a loyal following including celebrities and heads of state among their owners in the s blue bird developed a bus for a much wider audience named the city bird it was a variant of the all american developed for the masstransit segment a shortwheelbase rearengine bus the city bird was intended for smaller cities and routes with culdesac ends providing better maneuverability and more efficient costs than larger vehicles during the s with the use of small school buses increasing blue bird found a way to diversify its school bus line while school buses based on cutaway vans were not invented by the company blue bird found ways to gain significant market share in  blue bird introduced the micro bird based on a dual rearwheel chevroletgmc van chassis largely similar to the wayne busette the micro bird distinguished itself by featuring a fullheight school bus door and additional windows forward of the entry door to aid loadingzone visibility in  the smallbus lineup was expanded to two with the debut of the mini bird based on the gm p stepvan chassis while still a small bus in its own right the mini bird was designed with the advantage of the same body width of the

were a time of turmoil for school bus manufacturers many of the predictions of the luce brothers had largely come true as the babyboom generation completed their secondary education by the end of the s student populations a key factor in school bus sales for nearly three decades began to decline coupled with the fragile economy of the time three of the six largest school bus manufacturers carpenter superior and ward would file for bankruptcy in the early s with superior exiting school bus production entirely the recession of the early s cut deeply into profits leading to the reorganization or closure of several manufacturers blue bird fared better than most competitors becoming the largest manufacturer in terms of sales by the mids one out of every three new school buses was a blue bird a key factor to the sales expansion was the renewal of the blue bird product line at the end of the decade in  the company made two product introductions that would change the company due to increasing demand the company began inhouse production of rearengine chassis for the all american for the first time previously it was outsourced to other manufacturers also that year the company expanded the transitstyle school bus line from one to two with the introduction of the tc largely a response to the wayne lifestar the tc was developed in an effort to secure bids from operators of large fleets it was designed with a purchase price nearly in line with conventionalstyle bus however unlike competitors it was also designed with an inhouse chassis like the all american the tc was a runaway success by  nearly  in  new school buses was of the type introduced during  production blue bird made its first major changes to the all american since  along with major exterior updates there was an allnew powertrain lineup and a redesigned drivers compartment while blue bird had enjoyed major success during the s with school buses the company had mixed results with its masstransit products discontinuing the city bird in  after  years of production in  blue bird launched the qbus a  wide bus transit and charter applications unlike the city bird the qbus was not based upon any version of the all american during the s blue bird launched commercial versions of the all american and tc called the apc and csseries the buses were also sold in shell versions for upfitters as well in the early s the wanderlodge began to transition away from its school bus origins while still a heavyduty coach built largely to order the wanderlodge was redesigned to allow it to be built with a  wide body while the width was illegal for a school bus it had been allowed in motorcoaches and some competing motorhomes for some time additionally the change allowed blue bird to modernize the looks of vehicle in  blue bird introduced its first passenger motorcoach the ltc its first passenger motorcoach it became the donor platform for the wanderlodge from  onwards environmentallyfriendly busesedit the s were also a period that the company explored the use of alternative power sources for school buses in  blue bird introduced the first school bus an all american rear engine powered by compressed natural gas cng in  blue bird developed a batterypowered school bus in an effort with westinghouse electronic systems for a school district in california while the electric school bus remained a prototype blue bird has continued to offer cng as an option on the all american since its  introduction in  the envirobus  concept made its debut based loosely on the

a managementled buyout with the other  spread between paul glaske and  other blue bird managers after the buyout the company name changed from blue bird body company to blue bird corporation during the s and early s declining demand for school buses and changes in world markets would lead to a number of changes at the company leading to several ownership changes in  the british henlys group plc purchased blue bird with a substantial financial stake held by volvo group the ownership changes during the late s led to a number of changes in blue bird production facilities in  the factory in

line blue bird entered into a supply agreement with its canadian bus manufacturer girardin minibus its distributor in the country to supply dealers in the united states with the newly designed mbiimbiv cutaway van branded as blue birds while similar to the micro bird the blue bird mbiiiv by girardin allowed blue bird to offer an updated body design along with a configuration based on a

all american in  blue bird discontinued the slowselling tc in  and consolidated the tc with the all american early in  however the largest change came in  as blue bird sought to replace the cv while initially developed to use the ford f super duty chassis the vision underwent a major change before its release in a major break from precedent blue bird did not use an existing truck manufacturer for the chassis instead developing its own version from the ground up while the vision used the same bus body as the longrunning conventional engineering changes were made to optimize forward visibility as part of its acquisition by cerberus blue bird gradually saw itself positioned exclusively into yellow school bus production its largest market in  the xcel was discontinued and the lowfloor

early s al luce was perceived to have been nervous about using the family surname for the company out of fears of it being mispronounced ie the loose bus when showing a blue and yellow demonstrator unit to school officials luce overheard the positive reception of school children who had seen the bus who had nicknamed it a pretty blue bird luce chose that name for his body manufacturing company

tt chassis donated to the henry ford museum in  as the second quarter of the th century began albert luce sr was one of the entrepreneurs of the period who transitioned from building wagons to developing some of the earliest purposebuilt school buses what is now blue bird corporation began life as a side project in a ford motor company dealership in perry georgia along with the dealership in perry luce owned the ford franchise in fort valley georgia a rural farming community south of macon in  luce had sold a customer a ford model t with a wooden bus body the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural georgia roads the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads in place of wood luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheetmetal wood was used as a secondary material completed in  the bus was put into use as a school bus while buses would initially remain a side project for luce with only  bus bodies produced between  and  the onset of the great depression would make a change in his company forever following a  decline in car sales in  luce sold both of his ford dealerships using the  proceeds from the sale to begin his own company concentrating solely on bus production inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools the early use of farm wagons on a parttime basis soon evolved into purposebuilt school bus products each with economy and function as major priorities in  the company began production of fullsteel bus bodies an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the united states in a  conference blue bird engineers helped to develop the color school bus yellow which is still in use today during world war ii bus production was largely diverted to the armed forces with blue bird producing buses and mobile ambulances due to rationing of steel company engineers were forced to reengineer several body assemblies to minimize use of steel by the end of the war increased bus production lead blue bird school buses to come into use in many school districts in the southern us outside of georgia – postwar transitionedit following world war ii the configuration of schools throughout the united states continued to change in rural communities school districts transitioned away from schoolhouses towards centralized schools sharing the graded class structures of urban schools while urban populations moved into suburbs depending on location the previous practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical particularly as students progressed into high school in both rural and suburban school districts the addition of the babyboom generation lead to a new demand for school transportation near the end of  blue bird would see its factory in fort valley georgia destroyed by fire forcing the company to build a new facility though the factory building was destroyed a significant amount of equipment was salvaged allowing bus production to resume shortly afterward in the postwar period blue bird would grow substantially becoming one of the larger body manufacturers in the united states during the late s the leadership of

to an rv as the s became the s blue bird grew rapidly becoming the fourthlargest manufacturer of school buses to accommodate the added demand the luce brothers added several production facilities to supplement the fort valley georgia plant in  blue bird canada was opened in brantford ontario in  blue bird midwest was opened in mount pleasant iowa in  blue bird moved production beyond north america with blue bird central america in guatemala to lower production and maintenance costs while the conventional and all american bodies were produced they were built on locally sourced chassis from mercedesbenz hino nissan diesel and toyota company founder al luce died in  shortly after the three luce sons sought to diversify the company product line fearing that the school bus industry whose demand was influenced by the baby boom generation would eventually drop off as students completed their education at the beginning of the decade the blue bird company logo made its debut painted on the roofline of many of its buses in  the first major blue bird venture outside of school buses made its debut named the blue bird transit home rebranded wanderlodge in  it was a   in  dollars luxury recreational vehicle based on the all american using the heavyduty frame and allsteel body to its advantage the vehicle was marketed as higherquality than other rvs of the time the interior was largely built to order based on the all american for over  years the wanderlodge developed a loyal following including celebrities and heads of state among their owners in the s blue bird developed a bus for a much wider audience named the city bird it was a variant of the all american developed for the masstransit segment a shortwheelbase rearengine bus the city bird was intended for smaller cities and routes with culdesac ends providing better maneuverability and more efficient costs than larger vehicles during the s with the use of small school buses increasing blue bird found a way to diversify its school bus line while school buses based on cutaway vans were not invented by the company blue bird found ways to gain significant market share in  blue bird introduced the micro bird based on a dual rearwheel chevroletgmc van chassis largely similar to the wayne busette the micro bird distinguished itself by featuring a fullheight school bus door and additional windows forward of the entry door to aid loadingzone visibility in  the smallbus lineup was expanded to two with the debut of the mini bird based on the gm p stepvan chassis while still a small bus in its own right the

in brooklyn new york main article blue bird tc the late s and early s were a time of turmoil for school bus manufacturers many of the predictions of the luce brothers had largely come true as the babyboom generation completed their secondary education by the end of the s student populations a key factor in school bus sales for nearly three decades began to decline coupled with the fragile economy of the time three of the six largest school bus manufacturers carpenter superior and ward would file for bankruptcy in the early s with superior exiting school bus production entirely the recession of the early s cut deeply into profits leading to the reorganization or closure of several manufacturers blue bird fared better than most competitors becoming the largest manufacturer in terms of sales by the mids one out of every three new school buses was a blue bird a key factor to the sales expansion was the renewal of the blue bird product line at the end of the decade in  the company made two product introductions that would change the company due to increasing demand the company began inhouse production of rearengine chassis for the all american for the first time previously it was outsourced to other manufacturers also that year the company expanded the transitstyle school bus line from one to two with the introduction of the tc largely a response to the wayne lifestar the tc was developed in an effort to secure bids from operators of large fleets it was designed with a purchase price nearly in line with conventionalstyle bus however unlike competitors it was also designed with an inhouse chassis like the all american the tc was a runaway success by  nearly  in  new school buses was of the type introduced during  production blue bird made its first major changes to the all american since  along with major exterior updates there was an allnew powertrain lineup and a redesigned drivers compartment while blue bird had enjoyed major success during the s with school buses the company had mixed results with its masstransit products discontinuing the city bird in  after  years of production in  blue bird launched the qbus a  wide bus transit and charter applications unlike the city bird the qbus was not based upon any version of the all american during the s blue bird launched commercial versions of the all american and tc called the apc and csseries the buses were also sold in shell versions for upfitters as well in the early s the wanderlodge began to transition away from its school bus origins while still a heavyduty coach built largely to order the wanderlodge was redesigned to allow it to be built with a  wide body while the width was illegal for a school bus it had been allowed in motorcoaches and some competing motorhomes for some time additionally the change allowed blue bird to modernize the looks of vehicle in  blue bird introduced its first passenger motorcoach the ltc its first passenger motorcoach it became the

partners purchased an  stake of the company in a managementled buyout with the other  spread between paul glaske and  other blue bird managers after the buyout the company name changed from blue bird body company to blue bird corporation during the s and early s declining demand for school buses and changes in world markets would lead to a number of changes at the company leading to several

in  in  in an effort to supplement its product line blue bird entered into a supply agreement with its canadian bus manufacturer girardin minibus its distributor in the country to supply dealers in the united states with the newly designed mbiimbiv cutaway van branded as blue birds while similar to the micro bird the blue bird mbiiiv by girardin allowed blue bird to offer an updated body design

decade following the substantial update of the all american in  blue bird discontinued the slowselling tc in  and consolidated the tc with the all american early in  however the largest change came in  as blue bird sought to replace the cv while initially developed to use the ford f super duty chassis the vision underwent a major change before its release in a major break from precedent blue bird did not use an existing truck manufacturer for the chassis instead developing its own version from the ground up while the vision used the same bus body as the longrunning conventional engineering changes were made to optimize forward visibility as part of its acquisition by cerberus blue bird gradually saw itself positioned exclusively into yellow school bus production its largest market in

historyedit – the change to steeledit blue bird number  built on a  ford model tt chassis donated to the henry ford museum in  as the second quarter of the th century began albert luce sr was one of the entrepreneurs of the period who transitioned from building wagons to developing some of the earliest purposebuilt school buses what is now blue bird corporation began life as a side project in a ford motor company dealership in perry georgia along with the dealership in perry luce owned the ford franchise in fort valley georgia a rural farming community south of macon in  luce had sold a customer a ford model t with a wooden bus body the customer sought to use the bus to transport his workers due to a combination of unsatisfactory construction quality of the bus body and the rough conditions of the rural georgia roads the wooden bus body started to disintegrate before the customer had finished paying for the vehicle driven to produce an improved design to sell to his customers luce sought input to develop a stronger bus body capable of surviving unimproved roads in place of wood luce constructed his bus body from steel and sheetmetal wood was used as a secondary material completed in  the bus was put into use as a school bus while buses would initially remain a side project for luce with only  bus bodies produced between  and  the onset of the great depression would make a change in his company forever following a  decline in car sales in  luce sold both of his ford dealerships using the  proceeds from the sale to begin his own company concentrating solely on bus production inspired to begin production in order to support the local economy luce also felt school buses would be a necessary resource as part of the shift towards consolidated schools the early use of farm wagons on a parttime basis soon evolved into purposebuilt school bus products each with economy and function as major priorities in  the company began production of fullsteel bus bodies an innovation which soon replaced the wooden bodies which were then in common use around the united states in a  conference blue bird engineers helped to develop the color school bus yellow which is still in use today during world war ii bus production was largely diverted to the armed forces with blue bird producing buses and mobile ambulances due to rationing of steel company engineers were forced to reengineer several body assemblies to minimize use of steel by the end of the war increased bus production lead blue bird school buses to come into use in many school districts in the southern us outside of georgia – postwar transitionedit following world war ii the configuration of schools throughout the united states continued to change in rural communities school districts transitioned away from schoolhouses towards centralized schools sharing the graded class structures of urban schools while urban populations moved into suburbs depending on location the previous practice of walking to school had become increasingly impractical particularly as students progressed into high school in both rural and suburban school districts the addition of the babyboom generation lead to a new demand for school transportation near the end of  blue bird would see its factory in fort valley georgia destroyed by fire forcing the company to build a new facility though the factory building was destroyed a significant amount of equipment was salvaged allowing bus production to resume shortly afterward in the postwar period blue bird would grow substantially becoming

bird  blue bird wanderlodge early s blue bird school bus with a chevrolet c chassis this bus is being converted to an rv as the s became the s blue bird grew rapidly becoming the fourthlargest manufacturer of school buses to accommodate the added demand the luce brothers added several production facilities to supplement the fort valley georgia plant in  blue bird canada was opened in brantford ontario in  blue bird midwest was opened in mount pleasant iowa in  blue bird moved production beyond north america with blue bird central america in guatemala to lower production and maintenance costs while the conventional and all american bodies were produced they were built on locally sourced chassis from mercedesbenz hino nissan diesel and toyota company founder al luce died in  shortly after the three luce sons sought to diversify the company product line fearing that the school bus industry whose demand was influenced by the baby boom generation would eventually drop off as students completed their education at the beginning of the decade the blue bird company logo made its debut painted on the roofline of many of its buses in  the first major blue bird venture outside of school buses made its debut named the blue bird transit home rebranded wanderlodge in  it was a   in  dollars luxury recreational vehicle based on the all american using the heavyduty frame and allsteel body to its advantage the vehicle was marketed as higherquality than other rvs of the time the interior was largely built to order based on the all american for over  years the wanderlodge developed a loyal following including celebrities and heads of state among their owners in the s blue bird developed a bus for a much wider audience named the city bird it was a variant of the all american developed for the masstransit segment a shortwheelbase rearengine bus the city bird was intended for smaller cities and routes with culdesac ends providing better maneuverability and more efficient costs than larger vehicles during the s with the use of small school buses increasing blue bird found a way to diversify its school bus line while school buses based on cutaway vans were not invented by the company blue bird found ways to gain significant market share in  blue bird introduced the micro bird based on a dual rearwheel chevroletgmc van chassis largely similar to the wayne busette the micro bird distinguished itself by featuring a fullheight school bus door and additional windows forward of the entry door to aid loadingzone visibility in  the smallbus lineup was expanded to two with the debut of the mini bird based on the gm p stepvan chassis while still a small bus in its own right the mini bird was designed with the advantage of the same body width of the

were a time of turmoil for school bus manufacturers many of the predictions of the luce brothers had largely come true as the babyboom generation completed their secondary education by the end of the s student populations a key factor in school bus sales for nearly three decades began to decline coupled with the fragile economy of the time three of the six largest school bus manufacturers carpenter superior and ward would file for bankruptcy in the early s with superior exiting school bus production entirely the recession of the early s cut deeply into profits leading to the reorganization or closure of several manufacturers blue bird fared better than most competitors becoming the largest manufacturer in terms of sales by the mids one out of every three new school buses was a blue bird a key factor to the sales expansion was the renewal of the blue bird product line at the end of the decade in  the company made two product introductions that would change the company due to increasing demand the company began inhouse production of rearengine chassis for the all american for the first time previously it was outsourced to other manufacturers also that year the company expanded the transitstyle school bus line from one to two with the introduction of the tc largely a response to the wayne lifestar the tc was developed in an effort to secure bids from operators of large fleets it was designed with a purchase price nearly in line with conventionalstyle bus however unlike competitors it was also designed with an inhouse chassis like the all american the tc was a runaway success by  nearly  in  new school buses was of the type introduced during  production blue bird made its first major changes to the all american since  along with major exterior updates there was an allnew powertrain lineup and a redesigned drivers compartment while blue bird had enjoyed major success during the s with school buses the company had mixed results with its masstransit products discontinuing the city bird in  after  years of production in  blue bird launched the qbus a  wide bus transit and charter applications unlike the city bird the qbus was not based upon any version of the all american during the s blue bird launched commercial versions of the all american and tc called the apc and csseries the buses were also sold in shell versions for upfitters as well in the early s the wanderlodge began to transition away from its school bus origins while still a heavyduty coach built largely to order the wanderlodge was redesigned to allow it to be built with a  wide body while the width was illegal for a school bus it had been allowed in motorcoaches and some competing motorhomes for some time additionally the change allowed blue bird to modernize the looks of vehicle in  blue bird introduced its first passenger motorcoach the ltc its first passenger motorcoach it became the donor platform for the wanderlodge from  onwards

initially developed to use the ford f super duty chassis the vision underwent a major change before its release in a major break from precedent blue bird did not use an existing truck manufacturer for the chassis instead developing its own version from the ground up while the vision used the same bus body as the longrunning conventional engineering changes were made to optimize forward visibility as part of its acquisition by cerberus blue bird gradually saw itself positioned exclusively into yellow school bus production its largest market in  the xcel was discontinued and the lowfloor
