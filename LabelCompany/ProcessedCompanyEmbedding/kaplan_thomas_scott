masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid

one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work

new york city kaplan was raised in a jewish family in florida the son of lillian jean and jason jay kaplan in his youth he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for rembrandt which decades later inspired him respectively to found leading felid conservation group panthera and to establish the leiden collection the worlds largest private grouping of works from the dutch golden age at oxford university kaplan earned bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in history he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning while earning his phd he worked as an analyst covering israeli companies publicly traded in the us on a business trip he met his future wife daphne recanati the daughter of israeli investor leon recanati who had attended the same boarding school as kaplan daphnes mother artist mira recanati introduced him to israeli investor avi tiomkin who hired him as a junior partner in  kaplan had impressed tiomkin by correctly predicting saddam husseins  invasion of kuwait several years before it took place when tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in israel in  kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures careeredit inspired by marc faber who held that precious metals were insurance against the monetary foolishness of central governments kaplan focused on natural resources investing in  he founded apex silver mines to capitalize on the improving supplydemand fundamentals of metals while he was chairman and chief executive officer of apex his team discovered and financed the san cristobal deposit in bolivia now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world kaplan retired from apex silver at the end of  to focus on his new exploration projects in  a company related to kaplan became the largest investor in african platinum plc then known as southern african resources plc enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in south africa in  kaplan sold his position in african platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by impala platinum limited at a valuation of  million also in  kaplan founded leor exploration  production llc which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple

lillian jean and jason jay kaplan in his youth he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for rembrandt which decades later inspired him respectively to found leading felid conservation group panthera and to establish the leiden collection the worlds largest private grouping of works from the dutch golden age at oxford university kaplan earned bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in history he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning while earning his phd he worked as an analyst covering israeli companies publicly traded in the us on a business trip he met his future wife daphne recanati the daughter of israeli investor leon recanati who had attended the same boarding school as kaplan daphnes mother artist mira recanati introduced him to israeli investor avi tiomkin who hired him as a junior partner in  kaplan had impressed tiomkin by correctly predicting saddam husseins  invasion of kuwait several years before it took place when tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in israel in  kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures careeredit inspired by marc faber who held that precious metals were insurance against the monetary foolishness of central governments kaplan focused on natural resources investing in  he founded apex silver mines to capitalize on the improving supplydemand fundamentals of metals while he was chairman and chief executive officer of apex his team discovered and financed the san cristobal deposit in bolivia now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world kaplan retired from apex silver at the end of  to focus on his new exploration projects in  a company related to kaplan became the largest investor in african platinum plc then known as southern african resources plc enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in south africa in  kaplan sold his position in african platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by impala platinum limited at a valuation of  million also in  kaplan founded leor exploration  production llc which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at oxford university in collaboration with dr david macdonald in  the couple endowed the recanatikaplan center at oxford universitys wildlife conservation research unit the wildcru and the universitys postgraduate diploma in international wildlife conservation practice which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at oxford in february  oxfords wildcru was awarded the queens anniversary prize for higher education in recognition of wildcrus outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation in july  a male lion named cecil one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work in wildlife conservation in  the kaplans were awarded the new species award and the naming of the newly discovered oriannes tree snake by the african rainforest conservancy regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes kaplan said if you want psychic gratification one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime kaplan cites american media mogul and philanthropist ted turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species on june   in what kaplan described as a turning point for global cat conservation environmental philanthropists from china india the united arab emirates and the united states formed an unprecedented new global alliance with panthera committing an initial  million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the worlds wild cats and their ecosystems among the initial partners with the kaplans was sheikh mohamed

links early life and educationedit born in new york city kaplan was raised in a jewish family in florida the son of lillian jean and jason jay kaplan in his youth he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for rembrandt which decades later inspired him respectively to found leading felid conservation group panthera and to establish the leiden collection the worlds largest private grouping of works from the dutch golden age at oxford university kaplan earned bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in history he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning while earning his phd he worked as an analyst covering israeli companies publicly traded in the us on a business trip he met his future wife daphne recanati the daughter of israeli investor leon recanati who had attended the same boarding school as kaplan daphnes mother artist mira recanati introduced him to israeli investor avi tiomkin who hired him as a junior partner in  kaplan had impressed tiomkin by correctly predicting saddam husseins  invasion of kuwait several years before it took place when tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in israel in  kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures careeredit inspired by marc faber who held that precious metals were insurance against the monetary foolishness of central governments kaplan focused on natural resources investing in  he founded apex silver mines to capitalize on the improving supplydemand fundamentals of metals while he was chairman and chief executive officer of apex his team discovered and financed the san cristobal deposit in bolivia now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world kaplan retired from apex silver at the end of  to focus on his new exploration projects in  a company related to kaplan became the largest investor in african platinum plc then known as southern african resources plc enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in south africa in  kaplan sold his position in african platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by impala platinum limited at a valuation of  million also in  kaplan founded leor exploration  production llc which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at oxford university in collaboration with dr david macdonald in  the couple endowed the recanatikaplan center at oxford universitys wildlife conservation research unit the wildcru and the universitys postgraduate diploma in international wildlife conservation practice which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at oxford in february  oxfords wildcru was awarded the queens anniversary prize for higher education in recognition of wildcrus outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation in july  a male lion named cecil one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work in wildlife conservation in  the kaplans were awarded the new species award and the naming of the newly discovered oriannes tree snake by the african rainforest conservancy regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes kaplan said if you want psychic gratification one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime kaplan cites american media mogul and philanthropist ted turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species on june   in what kaplan described as a turning point for global cat conservation environmental philanthropists

worlds wild cats and their ecosystems among the initial partners with the kaplans was sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan crown prince of abu dhabi and whose personal commitment to the panthera

lillian jean and jason jay kaplan in his youth he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for rembrandt which decades later inspired him respectively to found leading felid conservation group panthera and to establish the leiden collection the worlds largest private grouping of works from the dutch golden age at oxford university kaplan earned bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in history he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning while earning his phd he worked as an analyst covering israeli companies publicly traded in the us on a business trip he met his future wife daphne recanati the daughter of israeli investor leon recanati who had attended the same boarding school as kaplan daphnes mother artist mira recanati introduced him to israeli investor avi tiomkin who hired him as a junior partner in  kaplan had impressed tiomkin by correctly predicting saddam husseins  invasion of kuwait several years before it took place when tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in israel in  kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures careeredit inspired by marc faber who held that precious metals were insurance against the monetary foolishness of central governments kaplan focused on natural resources investing in  he founded apex silver mines to capitalize on the improving supplydemand fundamentals of metals while he was chairman and chief executive officer of apex his team discovered and financed the san cristobal deposit in bolivia now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world kaplan retired from apex silver at the end of  to focus on his new exploration projects in  a company related to kaplan became the largest investor in african platinum plc then known as southern african resources plc enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in south africa in  kaplan sold his position in african platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by impala platinum limited at a valuation of  million also in  kaplan founded leor exploration  production llc which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at oxford university in collaboration with dr david macdonald in  the couple endowed the recanatikaplan center at oxford universitys wildlife conservation research unit the wildcru and the universitys postgraduate diploma in international wildlife conservation practice which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at oxford in february  oxfords wildcru was awarded the queens anniversary prize for higher education in recognition of wildcrus outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation in july  a male lion named cecil one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work in wildlife conservation in  the kaplans were awarded the new species award and the naming of the newly discovered oriannes tree snake by the african rainforest conservancy regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes kaplan said if you want psychic gratification one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime kaplan cites american media mogul and philanthropist ted turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species on june   in what kaplan described as a turning point for global cat conservation environmental philanthropists from china india the united arab emirates and the united states formed an unprecedented new global alliance with panthera committing an initial  million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the worlds wild cats and their ecosystems among the initial partners with the kaplans was sheikh mohamed

council of the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university where kaplan scholar graham allison and decorated american general david petraeus created the recanatikaplan

links early life and educationedit born in new york city kaplan was raised in a jewish family in florida the son of lillian jean and jason jay kaplan in his youth he developed a passion for wildlife conservation and for rembrandt which decades later inspired him respectively to found leading felid conservation group panthera and to establish the leiden collection the worlds largest private grouping of works from the dutch golden age at oxford university kaplan earned bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in history he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the malayan counterinsurgency and the manner in which commodities influence strategic planning while earning his phd he worked as an analyst covering israeli companies publicly traded in the us on a business trip he met his future wife daphne recanati the daughter of israeli investor leon recanati who had attended the same boarding school as kaplan daphnes mother artist mira recanati introduced him to israeli investor avi tiomkin who hired him as a junior partner in  kaplan had impressed tiomkin by correctly predicting saddam husseins  invasion of kuwait several years before it took place when tiomkin decided to concentrate his investments solely in israel in  kaplan moved on to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures careeredit inspired by marc faber who held that precious metals were insurance against the monetary foolishness of central governments kaplan focused on natural resources investing in  he founded apex silver mines to capitalize on the improving supplydemand fundamentals of metals while he was chairman and chief executive officer of apex his team discovered and financed the san cristobal deposit in bolivia now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world kaplan retired from apex silver at the end of  to focus on his new exploration projects in  a company related to kaplan became the largest investor in african platinum plc then known as southern african resources plc enabling it to explore and develop one of the largest platinum group metals projects in south africa in  kaplan sold his position in african platinum as part of a transaction in which the company was acquired by impala platinum limited at a valuation of  million also in  kaplan founded leor exploration  production llc which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at oxford university in collaboration with dr david macdonald in  the couple endowed the recanatikaplan center at oxford universitys wildlife conservation research unit the wildcru and the universitys postgraduate diploma in international wildlife conservation practice which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at oxford in february  oxfords wildcru was awarded the queens anniversary prize for higher education in recognition of wildcrus outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation in july  a male lion named cecil one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work in wildlife conservation in  the kaplans were awarded the new species award and the naming of the newly discovered oriannes tree snake by the african rainforest conservancy regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes kaplan said if you want psychic gratification one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime kaplan cites american media mogul and philanthropist ted turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species on june   in what kaplan described as a turning point for global cat conservation environmental philanthropists

worlds wild cats and their ecosystems among the initial partners with the kaplans was sheikh mohamed bin zayed al nahyan crown prince of abu dhabi and whose personal commitment to the panthera

the san cristobal deposit in bolivia now one of the largest producers of silver and zinc in the world kaplan retired from apex silver at the end of  to focus on his new exploration projects in  a

kaplan founded leor exploration  production llc which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at oxford university in collaboration with dr david macdonald in  the couple endowed the recanatikaplan center at oxford universitys wildlife conservation research unit the wildcru and the universitys postgraduate diploma in international wildlife conservation practice which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at oxford in february  oxfords wildcru was awarded the queens anniversary prize for higher education in recognition of wildcrus outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation in july  a male lion named cecil one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work in wildlife conservation in  the kaplans were awarded the new species award and the naming of the newly discovered oriannes tree snake by the african rainforest conservancy regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes kaplan said if you want psychic gratification one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime kaplan cites american media mogul and philanthropist ted turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species on june   in what kaplan described as a turning point for global cat conservation environmental philanthropists from china india the united arab emirates and the united states formed an unprecedented new global alliance with panthera committing an initial  million over the succeeding ten years to conserve the worlds wild cats and their ecosystems among the initial partners with

which became the fastestgrowing privately held hydrocarbon exploration and production company in the united states in  leor’s natural gas assets were sold to encana oil  gas usa inc for  billion kaplan first began investing heavily in gold in  since the sales of african platinum and leor in  kaplan has focused on the electrum group its exploration arm electrum ltd which he cofounded with dr larry buchanan owns a diversified international portfolio of gold exploration assets its other entities hold significant interests in several publicly traded companies including novagold resources inc and gabriel resources ltd two companies that own several of the largest proven gold resources in the world among its private interests the electrum group is the controlling shareholder of sunshine silver mining  refining corporation which owns the sunshine silver mine in idaho the most prolific silver mine in us history as well as the los gatos silverzinc deposit in mexico which it is developing in partnership with dowa of japan his view on gold has not changed on february   he commented in marc faber’s gloom boom  doom report “some will say that  gold seems expensive i would suggest the contrary that a few years from now sub gold will feel like a true gift the forced liquidation of leveraged positions of all kinds in late  and early  has presented an extraordinary opportunity to build long gold positions at low prices… it should not be a surprise to see gold set new highs against all currencies including a strong dollar and an acceleration of the most enduring bull market in the world” in a january  oped in the financial times’ market insights column kaplan discussed the prudent man construct as a tool to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold in that piece he explained that a variety of factors – including the supply of and demand for gold the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay – are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes” according to kaplan these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal therefore “the prudent man rule may well be golden indeed” as a leading investor in gold kaplan is credited with correctly predicting that gold prices would increase his investment strategy and commitment to gold led bloomberg businessweek to refer to him as golds evangelist in a may  profile piece in the wall street journal kaplan said “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” adding “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” kaplans robust presence in the gold market was recognized in a december  wall street journal article which described kaplan along with other investors including john paulson david einhorn and john burbank the article stated that kaplan is “making a bigger wager on gold than almost any investor” noting that he believes junior miners provide the “greatest leverage to a bull market” and that the world is “entering an era defined by the scarcity value of great preciousmetals assets” in a  interview in the octavian report kaplan reaffirmed his bullish views on gold stating as a secular trend i see a great many similarities between the dow in the s and where we are today in gold during the s if one bought the djia at   or  it didnt have a material impact on longterm returns at any of those levels it was a great buy i feel the same for gold if one gets that one last leg down to complete the cycle so much the better but prices are headed much much higher after this correction is over ive been in this movie before kaplan further reinforced this stance in an article he authored for the january  issue of the gloom boom  doom report entitled the tortoise and the hare having a second bite of the apple he wrote is not reserved just for those who bought apple it can be had by carefully selecting an equity in an unpopular asset class with a global brand recognition greater even than apple itself gold rembrandt and the old mastersedit kaplans passion for the dutch masters began in his early childhood i was touched by rembrandt in a very deep way when i first encountered one of his paintings at the metropolitan museum in new york when i was six when i was eight and my parents asked me where i wanted to go on vacation i said amsterdam because thats where rembrandt was from i was floored by the beauty of the old masters the richness of the inner life that they were able to capture kaplan and his wife daphne recanati kaplan began to collect the art of the dutch golden age in  their leiden collection is now among the largest private assemblages of dutch art in the world rivaling the holdings of many major museums named after rembrandts native city the collection currently numbers more than  paintings and drawings most of which are included in a free highresolution online catalogue the kaplans intention was to establish a lending library for old masters including loans for special exhibitions as well as loans to bolster longterm installations kaplan explained in effect we were absorbing these paintings and taking them out of private hands and into the public domain in many cases for the first time we got a lot more pleasure sharing the collection focuses on rembrandt and his school illuminating the personalities and themes that shaped the golden age over five generations how the collection developed is explained in kaplans personal account of the journey a portrait in oil at the core of the collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings by rembrandt himself the largest private collection of the master and key members of his circle including his teacher pieter lastman and studiomate jan lievens in addition the collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum ranging from gerrit dou through to artists including govert flinck ferdinand bol and his last student aert de gelder the collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil carel fabritius a parallel focus of the collection is the representation of other artists from leiden in particular the fijnschilders fine manner painters including frans van mieris and gabriël metsu who flourished during midcentury under the influence of rembrandts first pupil gerrit dou the number of paintings by fijnschilders represented in the leiden collection is unmatched in any other private or public collection in addition tracing the interrelationships between amsterdam and leiden the collection also comprises masterpieces by artists from centers other than these two cities including frans hals from haarlem gerard ter borch from deventer hendrick ter brugghen from utrecht and the only remaining privately held work by johannes vermeer from delft the kaplans aspire for the collection to have an impact that reaches beyond the realms of scholarship and research the couple believes in the power of art to help forge an alliance of civilizations and transcend cultural differences at the launch of their exhibition masterpieces from the leiden collection – the age of rembrandt which opened at the louvre museum in february  kaplan stated our sense of mission is to use old masters to promote humanism and its noble offspring tolerance and mutual respect art alone may not save the world but it can help repair it in expanding upon his hopes for additional exhibitions planned for china and the middle east kaplan explained that rather than silently acquiescing to the building of walls or the burning of bridges my wife and i are using the most powerful tools we have rembrandt and our passion to build the connections that bind people together rather than tear us apart the unveiling of the leiden collection along with its highprofile exhibition at the louvre museum received extensive international coverage including profiles in among others the new york times le monde le figaro the wall street journal the economist and handelsblatt philanthropyedit conservationedit kaplan is the executive chairman of panthera corporation a charity which he and his wife cofounded in  panthera is devoted to preserving the big cats and their ecosystems and has been recognized as a leading force in felid conservation conservationist doug tompkins has referred to panthera as the foremost big cat conservation organization in the world with national geographic saying panthera represents the most comprehensive effort of its kind in wildcat conservation panthera created and maintains the largest protected jaguar corridor in the americas in particular the work of panthera’s ceo dr alan rabinowitz and kaplan to balance the preservation of the jaguar corridor in brazil with sustainable ranching was the focus of a january  profile by cbss  minutes in that piece kaplan outlined his thesis for utilizing sustainable ranching and community development to protect the apex predator and its environment there is no better way to stop poaching than to make the local community say hey wait a minute our children have medicine and education because of the jaguar when you show that you have won their hearts and their minds then you have won the war for his work as an environmentalist kaplan was the recipient of the hero of the year award by the iwff in  kaplan and his wife daphne helped establish a globally recognized felid conservation program at oxford university in collaboration with dr david macdonald in  the couple endowed the recanatikaplan center at oxford universitys wildlife conservation research unit the wildcru and the universitys postgraduate diploma in international wildlife conservation practice which offers young conservationists from developing countries access to training at oxford in february  oxfords wildcru was awarded the queens anniversary prize for higher education in recognition of wildcrus outstanding work in wildlife and environmental conservation in july  a male lion named cecil one of those being studied by the wildcrus hwange lion research project was killed in zimbabwe by a trophy hunter the killing of cecil led to a public outcry across the world the hwange project had been funded by the kaplans directly and through pantheras project leonardo for us cecil was like part of the family so we don’t take this lightly kaplan said cecil became a symbol while he was alive but in death he may very well have become the iconic representation of the precarious plight of his species the campaign to highlight the plight of african lions brought considerable attention to the wildcru and oxford prompting professor macdonald to remark to forbes magazine i think it’s also obvious that tom and his wife daphne have given more to big cat conservation than probably anybody else in history the kaplans also founded the orianne society focused on the conservation of the eastern indigo snake and its habitat the last remaining longleaf pine forests of the southeastern united states as part of this effort the kaplans created the orianne indigo snake preserve in georgia through the purchase and donation of  acres of the snake’s winter habitat in recognition for their work in wildlife conservation in  the kaplans were awarded the new species award and the naming of the newly discovered oriannes tree snake by the african rainforest conservancy regarding his wildlife conservation work with big cats and snakes kaplan said if you want psychic gratification one of the greatest ways is to know that you’ve made a real contribution to saving a species from blinking out during your lifetime kaplan cites american media mogul and philanthropist ted turner as one of the great inspirations of philanthropy and as a role model in saving imperiled species on june   in what

capital gold group report a billionaire goes allin on gold by capital gold group on may    comments by liam pleven and carolyn cui may   michael rubenstein for the wall street journal tigris financial’s thomas kaplan in his new york office this past week on his investment focus ‘i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold’ gold is setting records again boosting the holdings of central banks armageddon worrywarts and ordinary people who own gold bars coins and jewelry but few individuals stand to benefit as much as lowprofile billionaire thomas kaplan a new yorkborn commodities magnate who earned a doctorate in british colonial history at oxford mr kaplan oversees an empire devoted largely to gold many fund managers and highrollers have allocated small percentages of their portfolios to gold as a hedge against inflation but mr kaplan is the bull of bullion he has gone further than perhaps any other major investor betting the majority of his wealth on gold and other precious metals and it reflects his deeply held conviction that global economic instability could bring rising demand for gold through his firm tigris financial group and affiliates mr kaplan has loaded up on bullion and bought up properties in  countries on five continents where geologists are exploring for more tigris subsidiaries have taken stakes in mining companies including tiny firms that have yet to produce an ounce though he won’t disclose how much physical gold he owns mr kaplan who is  years old controls up to  of the shares in some socalled junior miners together his holdings amount to a nearly  billion bet on gold more than the brazilian central bank’s bullion is currently worth “i’ve reached a point where i feel the only asset i have confidence in is gold” mr kaplan said in an interview at tigris’s midtown manhattan headquarters mr kaplan’s views are shaped by a concern shared by many investors that heavy government spending hasn’t contained the woes facing the financial system gold hit an exchange record of  a troy ounce at the comex division of the new york mercantile exchange on may  days after eurozone leaders announced a nearly  trillion bailout for ailing member states he has experience with how supply and demand can drive the price of raw materials his doctoral thesis studied britain’s involvement after world war ii in malaya home to prized rubber and tin that taught him how far people and governments will go to secure natural resources wanting to apply his insights he went to israel to advise hedge funds his nose for finding valuable resources was developed at firms he started that explored for silver and natural gas which helped him make his fortune on demand and supply gold miners are struggling to make major discoveries and it takes years to bring new finds into production if people want to stock up on gold in a hurry it will be hard to ramp up production enough to satisfy them mr kaplan believes “you’ve got a perfect storm with no apparent solution” he said “if the world does well gold will be fine if the world doesn’t do well gold will also do fine … but a lot of other things could collapse” mr kaplan is known in the mining industry for his allin approach “when he likes something he dives in with both feet” egizio bianchini a banker at bmo capital markets in toronto said of mr kaplan whom he has worked with in the past in his charitable endeavors mr kaplan works similarly in  he cofounded panthera corp whose “singleminded pursuit” is preserving the world’s endangered wild cats he wrote in an open letter on the group’s site in which he cited inspirational quotes by winston churchill edward r murrow and marcus aurelius mr kaplan is also president of the board of directors at new york’s nd street y a prominent cultural organization that is a magnet for new york’s elite and he is a benefactor of eternal jewish family a group dedicated to uniform rules governing conversions to judaism whose leader resigned last year amid an alleged sex scandal in some cases mr kaplan has invested in gold miners that have also attracted the attention of fellow billionaires such as george soros and john paulson mr kaplan put money into one firm gabriel resources ltd in late  after mr paulson who made billions of dollars betting against housing markets mentioned how low the stock had fallen while they attended “the nutcracker” at the new york city ballet “i’m there” mr kaplan recalls was his response in early march mr paulson’s firm paulson  co and quantum partners ltd an investment fund run by soros fund management invested  million and  million respectively in novagold resources inc a canadian miner paying  a share their move came a year after mr kaplan who has  million invested in the company acquired  of the firm for  a share gold prices are up  this year after rising  last year which was the ninth straight up year for bullion mr kaplan thinks that greater gains are coming “i wouldn’t even say we’re in a bull market yet” he said but mr kaplan has concentrated risk in a volatile sector and he knows the potential pitfalls better than most in  for instance a company that mr kaplan founded apex silver mines ltd went bankrupt felled by the terms of a loan made after mr kaplan left the company in  the company emerged from bankruptcy last year and now operates as golden minerals co in january  mr kaplan received a socalled wells notice from the securities and exchange commission related to what the company said were “impermissible payments” of  to government officials by executives at a south american subsidiary the sec delivers wells notices to inform recipients that it may bring an enforcement action providing an opportunity for the recipient to persuade the agency not to pursue charges no charges have been filed against mr kaplan an sec spokesman declined to comment concentrated risk mr kaplan’s current investments also carry risk gabriel resources owns europe’s biggest undeveloped gold deposit in romania but has been waiting for government approval for years he has  million at stake in the company mr kaplan acknowledges the dangers involved in investing in small mining companies “it’s not the kind of thing i would suggest for widows and orphans” he said and he added he isn’t in a rush to cash in on his gold investments “if i am right about the big picture” he said “i will be rewarded for my patience” thomas s kaplan – chairman and chief investment officer of tigris financial group  years old doctorate in philosophy from

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
