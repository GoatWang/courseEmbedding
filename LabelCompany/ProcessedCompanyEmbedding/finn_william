first great american novel part of finns charm is the wisdom and sobering social criticism deftly lurking amongst the seemingly innocent observations of the uneducated huck and the evenlesseducated escaped slave jim william dufriss voice unpretentious and disarming like the books main characters seems the perfect armature on which to hang this literary strategy although he does an expert job with the entire cast dufriss delivery of jims dialogue is his crowning achievement out of context dufriss jim might sound mocking and racist due to his expert delivery of twains regional vernacular ignorance and intelligence however are not mutually exclusive and taken as a whole jims mind and heart come shining through allowing the listener to reflect on their own assumptions tantor
