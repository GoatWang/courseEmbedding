development todaro’s five years of living and teaching in africa as well as two decades of extensive travel throughout latin america and asia first as a director of the rockefeller foundation and then as a professor of economics at new york university helped shape and refine a book that is unique among development texts in approach organization and pedagogy the textbook economic development takes a policyoriented approach presenting economic theory in the context of critical policy debates and countryspecific case studies to show how theory relates to the problems and prospects of developing countries among its most significant innovations are the following it teaches economic development within the context of a major set of problems such as poverty inequality unemployment population growth environmental decay and rural stagnation formal abstract models and concepts are used to elucidate realworld development problems rather than being presented in isolation from case study illustrations it adopts a problem and policyoriented approach to the teaching of development economics on the assumption that a central objective of any development economics course should be the fostering of a student’s ability to understand contemporary economic problems of developing countries and to reach independent and informed judgments and policy conclusions about their possible resolution it approaches development problems systematically by following a standard pedagogic procedure with regard to their analysis and exposition each chapter begins by stating the general nature of a problem its principal issues and how it is manifested empirically in various developing countries the chapter then presents main goals and possible objectives the role of economic analysis in illuminating the problem and some possible policy alternatives and their likely consequences this approach not only helps students think systematically about major current development issues but even more important provides them with a methodology and an operating procedure for analyzing and reaching policy conclusions about other contemporary and future development problems it starts from the premise that it is possible to design and structure a broadly based development economics textbook that simultaneously uses the best available data from africa asia and latin america and appropriate theoretical tools to illuminate common developing country problems although these problems will of course differ in both scope and magnitude when we deal with such diverse countries as india bangladesh kenya egypt nigeria brazil mexico and guatemala it focuses on a wide range of developing countries not only as independent nationstates but also in relation to one another and in their interactions with rich nations in a global economy it recognizes the necessity of treating the problems of development and underdevelopment from an institutional and structural noneconomic as well as an economic perspective with appropriate modifications of received general economic principles theories and policies it thus attempts to combine relevant theory with realistic institutional analyses it views development and underdevelopment in both domestic and international contexts stressing the increasing interdependence of the world economy in areas such as food energy natural resources technology information and financial flows it considers the many economic social and institutional problems of underdevelopment as closely interrelated and requiring simultaneous and coordinated approaches to their solution at both the national and international levels topics include the capability approach to development comparative development economic growth convergence contemporary models including multiple equilibria poverty inequality population migration urbanization education child labor health agriculture environment roles of markets and government nongovernmental organisations

is a detailed examination of impacts and outlooks regarding the recent global financial crisis and economic development the revision features reports of development economics empirical findings in boxes that examine a variety of both methods and topics and address both specific policy concerns — such as improving child health education and microfinance design — and a broader understanding of sources of disparities in the world’s economies that can inform strategy of economic development the text features comparative case studies including indepth comparisons of ghana and côte divoire and
