managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report our audited financial statements are stated in united states dollars and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles overview ngfc equities inc we us our ngfc ngfc equities or the company was incorporated in the state of florida on october   since inception the company has been engaged in organizational efforts and obtaining initial financing the company was formed to i construct andor purchase and manage a chain of combined gasoline diesel and natural gas ng fueling and service stations initially in the miami fl area ii construct conversion factories to convert ng to liquefied natural gas lng and compressed natural gas cng and iii construct conversion factories to retrofit vehicles currently using gasoline or diesel fuel to also run on ng in the united states at a board of directors meeting held on february   the company chose to diversify its operations by adding two additional divisions to its original business strategy to set up three divisions as follows  energy and retail division  healthcare division  consulting division as we have indicated in the schedule c information that we filed with the security and exchange commission on january   we received our stockholder approval to change the name of our company from natural gas fueling and conversion inc to ngfc equities inc to better reflect our strategy of diversification the reason for the change in our business strategy came about through many meetings we had with various business owners both in the energy and retail sectors where our original focus was and also in other business sectors since we began our operations we identified owners of various businesses with promising upside potential who showed an interest in joining us under the transparency of our public company platform with us providing administrative tasks with those business owners continuing to operate their business and thus we have chosen to diversify our business objectives to operate profitable businesses in industries other than the energy and retail industry mostly through subsidiaries that will be managed by experienced operators with our company providing administrative assistance as the majority or  owner while continuing to focus on our original concept of setting up operating units in the energy sector as we get the funding to do so as part of this change in our strategy the company acquired  of the equity of ecilatam inc ecil that was incorporated in the state of florida on march   and is engaged in installation and performing maintenance and repairs of large medical equipment that deal in sterilization and disinfection ecil also sells spare parts consumables and service contracts for medical establishments as of now  of ecil sales and services are performed outside the usa also  of the maintenance and repairs for the period of these financial statements have been done only for the medical equipment belonging to getinge group a public company based in sweden who manufacture and distribute their own large medical equipment in may  ecil set up an animal health division to manufacture package market and distribute globally an infection healing cream for dairy animals in august  this animal health division was transferred to a separate corporation incorporated in the state of florida entitled la veles inc lvi with ngfc owning  of lvi la veles was planning on setting up a factory in the republic of serbia to manufacture this cream with mr goran antic acting as the chief executive officer of la veles inc however the activation of this strategy did not proceed smoothly and in order to save time and cost the board on january rd  decided to be involved only with distribution of this antiinfection cream and also let ecil directly handle the work through ecil and not get la veles inc be involved with it ecil currently has no formal agreement with the manufacturer of this cream to distribute it currently lvi remains an inactive  owned subsidiary of ngfc the cost of setting up lvi and making it inactive had been minimal for us due to the expertise of our staff in forming the corporation handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team on march   the company set up ngfc limited partnership nglp the partnership with the company acting as the general partner one objective of the partnership was to raise funds in the private market through any exempt offerings to acquire gasoline stations that the partnership would lease back to the company to earn a fixed return the partnership also has invested a portion of its funds in the financial markets one of the unique features of the partnership is an option the limited partners to the partnership will have to convert  of their contributed capital regardless of the balance of the capital account to shares of ngfc at a preagreed strike price within a preagreed period on may   we filed a form k deconsolidating nglp from ngfc because in the event the investment by nglp in public company stocks to be more than  of the total assets that may require us to register ngfc under the investment company act of  which we would like to avoid since the purpose of ngfc is to acquire companies to operate through subsidiaries and not be a passive investor while it is more practical for nglp to make a better return on the money nglp is holding by investing in any alternative investments while nglp still consider acquiring land and building that house operating gasoline stations to rent to energy and retail division of ngfc to get a fixed return on their money ngfc gave day written notice to all limited partners of nglp on july   informing ngfcs intention to resign as the general partner of ngfc effective august   concurrently to the above events andrew weeraratne the ceo of ngfc was appointed as the general partner of nglp also the board on the meeting held on may   approved to keep the option the current limited partners of nglp have as of may   to convert  of their capital to ngfc shares at  per shares by march   effective even after deconsolidation of nglp if this conversion feature was executed by all  limited partners then their total capital if any of them did not withdraw prior to march   of  could be converted at  cents per share to  shares of class a common stock of ngfc on may   we formed vanguard energy inc ve in san clemente california as  stockholder with an individual michael laub as  stockholder to conduct some of the business in our energy and retail division through ve mr laub is the founder and chief executive officer of cng united llc based in san clemente california that deals in training installation of engines for gasoline vehicles to run on natural gas as well as safety and maintenance of hybrid engines and vehicles on the rd of january  the board of directors decided to discontinue the operation of ve due to recent price decline in gasoline and until we assess the cost benefit of the vehicle conversion division and have mr laub who currently manages cng united llc work as a consultant for ngfc the financial cost of setting up and discontinuing ve had been minimal for us due to the expertise of our staff in forming the corporation handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team results of operations we have incurred recurring losses to date our financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation we expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through among other things the sale of equity or debt securities our consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders for the fiscal year from october   to september   is  and income from discontinued operations for the same period is  during the fiscal year ended september   we realized  in long term capital losses and  in short term capital gains and hold  in unrealized capital gains of stock and option position and generated  in dividend revenue during the fiscal year ending september   we had revenue of  cost of goods sold of  and a gross profit of  and incurred operating expenses of  our consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders for the fiscal year from october   to september   is  during the fiscal year ended september   we realized  in short term gains and hold  in unrealized capital losses of stock and option position and generated  in dividend revenue during the fiscal year ending september   we had revenue of  cost of goods sold of  and a gross profit of  and incurred operating expenses of  the increase in capital gain and the decrease in unrealized losses from fiscal year  to  reflect the increase in investment account especially in nglp even taking into consideration that nglp was deconsolidated in may  increase in revenue and the corresponding increase in gross profits reflects the full year operation of ecil in  as opposed to partial year operation of ecil in fiscal year  liquidity and capital resources our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended september   has included an explanatory paragraph in their opinion that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended september   indicating that our current liquidity position raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern if we are unable to improve our liquidity position we may not be able to continue as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue as a going concern and therefore be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities other than in the normal course of business which could cause investors to suffer the loss of all or a substantial portion of their investment as of september   our current assets were  our current liabilities were  stockholders deficit was  and as of september   and noncontrolling interest were  the weighted average number of shares outstanding was  for the period from october   to september   as of september   our current assets were  our current liabilities were  stockholders equity was  as of september   and noncontrolling interest were  the weighted average number of shares outstanding was  for the period from october   to september   we believe we will require approximately  million of available capital for each proposed operational unit in our energy and retail division comprised of a combined gasoline diesel and ng fueling service station along with a convenience store and a vehicle conversion station therefore at this juncture we plan to acquire a currently operating small fuel station and operate it until we find capital to build our completed operational units our subsidiary in healthcare division currently making enough cash flow to survive on their own and will need only minimal amount of money to stay afloat on march   the company executed an agreement for an equity line sale of  worth of ngfc shares to southridge partners ii lp southridge at a  discount on  cents per share the price at which our shares were sold last on otcpink pursuant to this equity line we filed a s on march   and subsequently a series of sas amendments to the s to get sec effectiveness for southridge to sell up to  shares of our class a common stock for  these  shares are defined as put shares that we will put to southridge pursuant to the purchase agreement southridge may also be referred to in this document as the selling security holder the purchase agreement with southridge provides that southridge is committed to purchase up to  million of our common stock we may draw on the facility from time to time as and when we determine appropriate in accordance with the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement this portion was calculated as approximately  of the companys public float as of march   when we file out initial prospectus with reference this equity line we issued a note for  to southridge as payment with reference to this agreement we have recorded that amount as loan payable to southridge on our balance sheet and have charged additionalpaidincapital account correspondingly this loan is payable in full with accrued interest at  per annum by december   we received the effectiveness from the sec on august   to begin selling our shares to southridge under this equity line we made a put notice to southridge on august   pursuant to this equity line to purchase  worth of put shares however southridge did not execute that put notice since according to southridge our closing bid price as reported by closing bid price for the companys common stock on the principal market on a trading day as reported by bloomberg finance lp was below  of the price at which we requested southridge to purchase our stock apart from the above stated equity line with southridge ccurrently we have no other commitments to raise additional funds we plan to get funding to acquire such smaller fuel station from this equity line offering if such capital does not become available from the proceeds of any future offering or other sources we will be able to continue operations as a development stage company for approximately the next  months from available cash on hand while seeking additional sources of capital there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available cash flows from operating activities as stated elsewhere in this report we deconsolidated nglp from our company financial statement during this fiscal year on our cash flow statements we chose the option to combine cash flows from discontinued operations with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow category and add the cash and cash equivalents included in assets held for sale at the beginning and end of the period to the respective balances in the cash line item from the balance sheet and have reconciled the cash balance per cash flow statements with the cash balance per balance sheet as of september   on a note to the financial statements following table shows reconciliation of

minority partner of la veles inc plan of operation and funding following is a brief description of the activities which we have established to accomplish our short term and long term goals when we broke down our company to three divisions we have not been able to find the capital to accomplish what we anticipated with this strategy and also due to the merger agreement we have signed this situation may change energy and retail division � located several existing gasoline stations with convenience stores in miami florida as our potential acquisition targets after conducting due diligence and required audits � continued to talk with a business broker to seek out additional gasoline stations with convenience stores and garages for us to acquire healthcare division � seek to expand our subsidiary ecilatam inc to do maintenance work for major equipment being sold by other major manufacturers of medical equipment rather than maintaining only the medical equipment of the swedish manufacturer getinge group as we do now � meet with more companies in synergistic areas such as cell therapy to cure cancer to acquire as subsidiaries of our company for us to break into this new industry we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with our planned growth of our business our existing working capital we believe is adequate for us to continue with our operation for about months if we are successful in either borrowing funds for which there is no assurance and raise funds from any future offerings for which there is no assurance facilitating us to acquire smaller gasoline stations with convenience stores and generate positive cash flow as we have forecasted we believe that will enable us to fund our operations over the next  to  months we believe it would cost us about  million to build one of our model operational units and that will require us to raise substantial capital we have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements or any commitments from any sources to lend us funds or to buy our common stock we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement and through a direct public offering of equity in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i developmental expenses associated with a startup business and ii marketing expenses we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities and debt issuances thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet longterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations material commitments as of the date of this annual report we do not have any material commitments purchase of significant equipment we plan to acquire a small gasoline fueling station along with a convenience store after performing the required audits during the next twelve months provided we raise enough funds from a future offering also we may buy a portable ng fueling station to be installed in the premises of gasoline station that we would buy within the next twelve months offbalance sheet arrangements as of the date of this annual report we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
