mead was born february   in south hadley massachusetts he was raised in a protestant middleclass family comprising his father hiram mead his mother elizabeth storrs billings mead and his sister alice his father was a former congregationalist pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology at oberlin college’s theological seminary elizabeth storrs mead taught for two years at oberlin college and subsequently from  to  served as president of mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts in  george mead enrolled at oberlin college graduating in  with a ba degree after graduation mead taught grade school for about four months for the following three years he worked as a surveyor for the wisconsin central railroad company in autumn  mead enrolled at harvard university where his main interests were philosophy and psychology at harvard mead studied with josiah royce a major influence upon his thought and william james whose children he tutored in  mead left harvard after receiving only a ba and moved to leipzig germany to study with psychologist wilhelm wundt from whom he learned the concept of the gesture a concept central to his later work in  he married helen kingsbury castle – the sister of henry northrup castle – a friend he met at oberlin despite never finishing his dissertation mead was able to obtain a post at the university of michigan in  at the university of michigan mead met charles h cooley and john dewey both of whom would influence him greatly in  mead moved along with dewey to the university of chicago where he taught until his death deweys influence led mead into educational theory but his thinking soon diverged from that of dewey and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind self and society– no detached philosopher he was active in chicagos social and political affairs among his many activities include his work for the city club of chicago he believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in chicago he also worked as treasurer for chicagos hull house mead died of heart failure on april   writingsedit in a career spanning more than  years mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology however he did not publish any books following his death several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of meads social psychology course at the university of chicago his lecture notes and his numerous unpublished papers the four volumes are meads  carus lectures edited by charles w morris the philosophy of the present  edited by arthur e murphy mind self and society  edited by charles w morris movements of thought in the nineteenth century  edited by merritt h moore and the philosophy of the act  most notable among meads published papers are “suggestions towards a theory of the philosophical disciplines”  “social consciousness and the consciousness of meaning”  “what social objects must psychology presuppose”  “the mechanism of social consciousness”  “the social self”  “scientific method and the individual thinker” “a behavioristic account of the significant symbol”  “the genesis of self and social control”   “the objective reality of perspectives”  ”the nature of the past”   and “the philosophies of royce james and dewey in their american setting”   in his lifetime mead published around  scholarly articles reviews and incidental pieces given their diverse nature access to these writings is difficult the first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the s in  andrew j reck collected twentyfive of mead’s published articles in selected writings george herbert mead bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press   four years later john w petras published george herbert mead essays on his social psychology a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts more recently mary jo deegan published essays in social psychology  a book project originally abandoned by mead in the early s in  filipe carreira da silva edited the gh mead a reader the most comprehensive collection to date it includes thirty of mead’s most important articles ten of which previously unpublished the mead project at brock university in ontario intends to publish all of meads odd remaining unpublished manuscripts pragmatism and symbolic interactionedit much of meads work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm he insisted that the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings mead   the two most important roots of meads work and of symbolic interactionism in general are the philosophy of pragmatism and social as opposed to psychological behaviorism ie mead was concerned with the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli pragmatism is a wideranging philosophical position from which several aspects of meads influences can be identified there are four main tenets of pragmatism see internet encyclopedia of philosophy first to pragmatists true reality does not exist out there in the real world it is actively created as we act in and toward the world second people remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer works third people define the social and physical objects they encounter in the world according to their use for them lastly if we want to understand actors we must base that understanding on what people actually do three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and the actors ability to interpret the social world thus to mead and symbolic interactionists consciousness is not separated from action and interaction but is an integral part of both symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of transactionalism meads theories in part based on pragmatism and behaviorism were transmitted to many graduate students at the university of chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism– social philosophy behaviorismedit mead was a very important figure in th century social philosophy one of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms discussed in mind self and society also known as social behaviorism this concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology rooted intellectually in hegelian dialectics and process philosophy mead like dewey developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action human activity is in a pragmatic sense the criterion of truth and through human activity meaning is made joint activity including communicative activity is the means through which our sense of self is constituted the essence of meads social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure this approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in mead’s terms is the individualized focus of the communication process it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no “mind or thought without language” and language the content of mind “is only a development and product of social interaction” mind self and society  thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is emergent in “the dynamic ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience mind self and society  for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication mead’s concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of “mind self and society” is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment action is very important to his social theory and according to mead actions also occur within a communicative process the initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture a gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism the rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person on this level no communication occurs neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other the gestures are nonsignificant for communication to take place each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act here the gestures are significant symbols a significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication– mead grounded human perception in an actionnexus joas   we perceive the world in terms of the “means of living” mead   to perceive food is to perceive eating to perceive a house is to perceive shelter that is to say perception is in terms of action meads theory of perception is similar to that of j j gibson mead the social psychologist argued in tune with durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing preexisting society or more specifically social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society the self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves mead argued that we are objects first to other people and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people and thus through language we become other to ourselves in joint activity which mead called social acts humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their coactors a central mechanism within the social act which enables perspective taking is position exchange people within a social act often alternate social positions eg givingreceiving askinghelping winninglosing hidingseeking talkinglistening in childrens games there is repeated position exchange for example in hideandseek and mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops however for mead unlike john dewey and j j gibson the key is not simply human action but rather social action in humans the manipulatory phase of the act is socially mediated that is to say in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object this is what mead means by the social act as opposed to simply the act the latter being a deweyan concept nonhuman animals also manipulate objects but that is a nonsocial manipulation they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object humans on the other hand take the perspective of other actors towards objects and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination in the social act of economic exchange for example both buyer and seller must take each others perspectives towards the object being exchanged the seller must recognize the value for the buyer while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur mead was influenced on this point by adam smith nature of the selfedit a final piece of meads social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process mead states the self is a social process meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate ones complete self as previously discussed mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process as gestures are taken in by the individual organism the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others in the form of gestures and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes this process is characterized by mead as the i and the me the me is the social self and the i is the response to the me in other words the i is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others while the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes mead develops william james distinction between the i and the me the me is the accumulated understanding of the generalized other ie how one thinks ones group perceives oneself etc the i is the individuals impulses the i is self as subject the me is self as object the i is the knower the me is the known the mind or stream of thought is the selfreflective movements of the interaction between the i and the me there is neither i nor me in the conversation of gestures the whole act is not yet carried out but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture these dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense and form the basis of a theory of human cognition for mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the i and the me mead rooted the self’s “perception and meaning” deeply and sociologically in a common praxis of subjects joas   found specifically in social encounters understood as a combination of the i and the me mead’s self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence for mead existence in community comes before individual consciousness first one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become selfconscious philosophy of scienceedit mead is a major american philosopher by virtue of being along with john dewey charles peirce and william james one of the founders of pragmatism he also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature science and history to philosophical anthropology and to process philosophy dewey and alfred north whitehead considered mead a thinker of the first rank he is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries as far as his work on the philosophy of science mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment the notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience there is a social relation to inanimate objects for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly or that it manipulates indirectly in perception for example in taking introjecting or imitating the resistant role of a solid object an individual obtains cognition of what is inside nonliving things historically the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe contact experience includes experiences of position balance and support and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world our scientific concepts of space time and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation in developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature the conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement in the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs the ultimate in experience however is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act play and game and the generalized otheredit mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through play and game play comes first in the childs development the child takes different roles heshe observes in adult society and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles for instance he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing cops and robbers and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing doctor as a result of such play the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self however it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves in the next stage the game stage it is required that a person develop a full sense of self whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game furthermore these roles must have a definite relationship to one another to illustrate the game stage mead gives his famous example of a baseball game but in a game where a number of individuals are involved then the child taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else if he gets in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his own position he must know what everyone else is going to do in order to carry out his own play he has to take all of these roles they do not all have to be present in consciousness at the same time but at some moments he has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude such as the one who is going to throw the ball the one who is going to catch it and so on these responses must be in some degree present in his own makeup in the game then there is a set of responses of such others so organized that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other mead  in the game stage organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly to determine what they will do within a specific group– mead calls this the childs first encounter with the generalized other which is one of the main concepts mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the social self in human beings the generalized other can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity through understanding the generalized other the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected appropriate and so on in different social settings how does perspective taking occur according to mead it has been argued that social acts such as games and routine forms of social interaction enable perspective taking through position exchange assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives then it might be that by moving between roles in a game eg between hiding and seeking or buying and selling we come to learn about the perspective of the other this new interpretation of meads account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support bibliographyedit  the philosophy of the present open court publishing  mind self and society ed by charles w morris

death several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of meads social psychology course at the university of chicago his lecture notes and his numerous unpublished papers the four volumes are meads  carus lectures edited by charles w morris the philosophy of the present  edited by arthur e murphy mind self and society  edited by charles w morris movements of thought in the

thinker” “a behavioristic account of the significant symbol”  “the genesis of self and social control”   “the objective reality of perspectives”  ”the nature of the past”   and “the philosophies of royce james and dewey in their american setting”   in his lifetime mead published around  scholarly articles reviews and incidental pieces given their diverse nature access to these writings is difficult the first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the s in  andrew j reck collected twentyfive of mead’s published articles in selected writings george herbert mead bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press   four years later john w petras published george herbert mead essays on his social psychology a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts more recently mary jo deegan published essays in social psychology  a book project originally abandoned by mead in the early s in  filipe carreira da silva edited the gh mead a reader the most comprehensive collection to date it includes thirty of mead’s most important articles ten of which previously unpublished the mead project at brock university in ontario intends to publish all of meads odd remaining unpublished manuscripts pragmatism and symbolic interactionedit much of meads work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm he insisted that the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings mead   the two most important roots of meads work and of symbolic interactionism in general are the philosophy of pragmatism and social as opposed to psychological behaviorism ie mead was concerned with the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli pragmatism is a wideranging philosophical position from which several aspects of meads influences can be identified there are four main tenets of pragmatism see internet encyclopedia of philosophy first to pragmatists true reality does not exist out there in the real world it is actively created as we act in and toward the world second people remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer works third people define the social and physical objects they encounter in the world according to their use for them lastly if we want to understand actors we must base that understanding on what people actually do three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and the actors ability to interpret the social world thus to mead and symbolic interactionists consciousness is not separated from action and interaction but is an integral part of both symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of transactionalism meads theories in part based on pragmatism and behaviorism were transmitted to many graduate students at the university of chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism– social philosophy behaviorismedit mead was a very important figure in th century social philosophy one of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms discussed in mind self and society also known as social behaviorism this concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology rooted intellectually in hegelian dialectics and process philosophy mead like dewey developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action human activity is in a pragmatic sense the criterion of truth and through human activity meaning is made joint activity including communicative activity is the means through which our sense of self is constituted the essence of meads social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure this approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in mead’s terms is the individualized focus of the communication process it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no “mind or thought without language” and language the content of mind “is only a development and product of social interaction” mind self and society  thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is emergent in “the dynamic ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience mind self and society  for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication mead’s concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of “mind self and society” is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment action is very important to his social theory and according to mead actions also occur within a communicative process the initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture a gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism the rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person on this level no communication occurs neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other the gestures are nonsignificant for communication to take place each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act here the gestures are significant symbols a significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication– mead grounded human perception in an actionnexus joas   we perceive the world in terms of the “means of living” mead   to perceive food is to perceive eating to perceive a house is to perceive shelter that is to say perception is in terms of action meads theory of perception is similar to that of j j gibson mead the social psychologist argued in tune with durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing preexisting society or more specifically social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society the self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves mead argued that we are objects first to other people and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people and thus through language we become other to ourselves in joint activity which mead called social acts humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their coactors a central mechanism within the social act which enables perspective taking is position exchange people within a social act often alternate social positions eg givingreceiving askinghelping winninglosing hidingseeking talkinglistening in childrens games there is repeated position exchange for example in hideandseek and mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops however for mead unlike john dewey and j j gibson the key is not simply human action but rather social action in humans the manipulatory phase of the act is socially mediated that is to say in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object this is what mead means by the social act as opposed to simply the act the latter being a deweyan concept nonhuman animals also manipulate objects but that is a nonsocial manipulation they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object humans on the other hand take the perspective of other actors towards objects and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination in the social act of economic exchange for example both buyer and seller must take each others perspectives towards the object being exchanged the seller must recognize the value for the buyer while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur mead was influenced on this point by adam smith nature of the selfedit a final piece of meads social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process mead states the self is a social process meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate ones complete self as previously discussed mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process as gestures are taken in by the individual organism the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others in the form of gestures and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes this process is characterized by mead as the i and the me the me is the social self and the i is the response to the me in other words the i is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others while the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes mead develops william james distinction between the i and the me the me is the accumulated understanding of the generalized other ie how one thinks ones group perceives oneself etc the i is the individuals impulses the i is self as subject the me is self as object the i is the knower the me is the known the mind or stream of thought is the selfreflective movements of the interaction between the i and the me there is neither i nor me in the conversation of gestures the whole act is not yet carried out but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture these dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense and form the basis of a theory of human cognition for mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the i and the me mead rooted the self’s “perception and meaning” deeply and sociologically in a common praxis of subjects joas   found specifically in social encounters understood as a combination of the i and the me mead’s self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence for mead existence in community comes before individual consciousness first one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become selfconscious philosophy of scienceedit mead is a major american philosopher by virtue of being along with john dewey charles peirce and william james one of the founders of pragmatism he also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature science and history to philosophical anthropology and to process philosophy dewey and alfred north whitehead considered mead a thinker of the first rank he is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries as far as his work on the philosophy of science mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment the notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience there is a social relation to inanimate objects for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly or that it manipulates indirectly in perception for example in taking introjecting or imitating the resistant role of a solid object an individual obtains cognition of what is inside nonliving things historically the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe contact experience includes experiences of position balance and support and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world our scientific concepts of space time and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation in developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature the conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement in the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs the ultimate in experience however is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act play and game and the generalized otheredit mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through play and game play comes first in the childs development the child takes different roles heshe observes in adult society and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles for instance he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing cops and robbers and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing doctor as a result of such play the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self however it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves in the next stage the game stage it is required that a person develop a full sense of self whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game furthermore these roles must have a definite relationship to one another to illustrate the game stage mead gives his famous example of a baseball game but in a game where a number of individuals are involved then the child taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else if he gets in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his own position he must know what everyone else is going to do in order to carry out his own play he has to take all of these roles they do not all have to be present in consciousness at the same time but at some moments he has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude such as the one who is going to throw the ball the one who is going to catch it and so on these responses must be in some degree present in his own makeup in the game then there is a set of responses of such others so organized that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other mead  in the game stage organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly to determine what they will do within a specific group– mead calls this the childs first encounter with the generalized other which is one of the main concepts mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the social self in human beings the generalized other can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity through understanding the generalized other the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected appropriate and so on in different social settings how does perspective taking occur according to mead it has been argued that social acts such as games and routine forms of social interaction enable perspective taking through position exchange assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives then it might be that by moving between roles in a game eg between hiding and seeking or buying and selling we come to learn about the perspective of the other this new interpretation of meads account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support bibliographyedit  the philosophy of the present open court publishing  mind self and society ed by charles w morris university of chicago press isbn

communicative activity is the means through which our sense of self is constituted the essence of meads social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure this approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in mead’s terms is the individualized focus of the communication process it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no “mind or thought without language” and language the content of mind “is only a development and product of social interaction” mind self and society  thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is emergent in “the dynamic ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience mind self and society  for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication mead’s concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of “mind self and society” is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment action is very important to his social theory and according to mead actions also occur within a communicative process the initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture a gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism the rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person on this level no communication occurs neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other the gestures are nonsignificant for communication to take place each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act here the gestures are significant symbols a significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication– mead grounded human perception in an actionnexus joas   we perceive the world in terms of the “means of living” mead   to perceive food is to perceive eating to perceive a house is to perceive shelter that is to say perception is in terms of action meads theory of perception is similar to that of j j gibson mead the social psychologist argued in tune with durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing preexisting society or more specifically social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society the self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves mead argued that we are objects first to other people and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people and thus through language we become other to ourselves in joint activity which mead called social acts humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their coactors a central mechanism within the social act which enables perspective taking is position exchange people within a social act often alternate social positions eg givingreceiving askinghelping winninglosing hidingseeking talkinglistening in childrens games there is repeated position exchange for example in hideandseek and mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops however for mead unlike john dewey and j j gibson the key is not simply human action but rather social action in humans the manipulatory phase of the act is socially mediated that is to say in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object this is what mead means by the social act as opposed to simply the act the latter being a deweyan concept nonhuman animals also manipulate objects but that is a nonsocial manipulation they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object humans on the other hand take the perspective of other actors towards objects and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination in the social act of economic exchange for example both buyer and seller must take each others perspectives towards the object being exchanged the seller must recognize the value for the buyer while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur mead was influenced on this point by adam smith nature of the selfedit a final piece of meads social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process mead states the self is a social process meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate ones complete self as previously discussed mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process as gestures are taken in by the individual organism the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others in the form of gestures and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes this process is characterized by mead as the i and the me the me is the social self and the i is the response to the me in other words the i is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others while the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes mead develops william james distinction between the i and the me the me is the accumulated understanding of the generalized other ie how one thinks ones group perceives oneself etc the i is the individuals impulses the i is self as subject the me is self as object the i is the knower the me is the known the mind or stream of thought is the selfreflective movements of the interaction between the i and the me there is neither i nor me in the conversation of gestures the whole act is not yet carried out but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture these dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense and form the basis of a theory of human cognition for mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the i and the me mead rooted the self’s “perception and meaning” deeply and sociologically in a common praxis of subjects joas   found specifically in social encounters understood as a combination of the i and the me mead’s self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence for mead existence in community comes before individual consciousness first one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become selfconscious philosophy of scienceedit mead is a major american philosopher by virtue of being along with john dewey charles peirce and william james one of the founders of pragmatism he also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature science and history to philosophical anthropology and to process philosophy dewey and alfred north whitehead considered mead a thinker of the first rank he is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries as far as his work on the philosophy of science mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment the notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience there is a social relation to inanimate objects for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly or that it manipulates indirectly in perception for example in taking introjecting or imitating the resistant role of a solid object an individual obtains cognition of what is inside nonliving things historically the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe contact experience includes experiences of position balance and support and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world our scientific concepts of space time and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation in developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature the conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement in the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs the ultimate in experience however is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act play and game and the generalized otheredit mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through play and game play comes first in the childs development the child takes different roles heshe observes in adult society and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles for instance he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing cops and robbers and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing doctor as a result of such play the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self however it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves in the next stage the game stage it is required that a person develop a full sense of self whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game furthermore these roles must have a definite relationship to one another to illustrate the game stage mead gives his famous example of a baseball game but in a game where a number of individuals are involved then the child taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else if he gets in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his own position he must know what everyone else is going to do in order to carry out his own play he has to take all of these roles they do not all have to be present in consciousness at the same time but at some moments he has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude such as the one who is going to throw the ball the one who is going to catch it and so on these responses must be in some degree present in his own makeup in the game then there is a set of responses of such others so organized that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other mead  in the game stage organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly to determine what they will do within a specific group– mead calls this the childs first encounter with the generalized other which is one of the main concepts mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the social self in human beings the generalized other can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity through understanding the generalized other the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected appropriate and so on in different social settings how does perspective taking occur according to mead it has been argued that social acts such as games and routine forms of social interaction enable perspective taking through position exchange assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives then it might be that by moving between roles in a game eg between hiding and seeking or buying and selling we come to learn about the perspective of the other this new interpretation of meads account of taking the

raised in a protestant middleclass family comprising his father hiram mead his mother elizabeth storrs billings mead and his sister alice his father was a former congregationalist pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology at oberlin college’s theological seminary elizabeth storrs mead taught for two years at oberlin college and subsequently from  to  served as president of mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts in  george mead enrolled at oberlin college graduating in  with a ba degree after graduation mead taught grade school for about four months for the following three years he worked as a surveyor for the wisconsin central railroad company in autumn  mead enrolled at harvard university where his main interests were philosophy and psychology at harvard mead studied with josiah royce a major influence upon his thought and william james whose children he tutored in  mead left harvard after receiving only a ba and moved to leipzig germany to study with psychologist wilhelm wundt from whom he learned the concept of the gesture a concept central to his later work in  he married helen kingsbury castle – the sister of henry northrup castle – a friend he met at oberlin despite never finishing his dissertation mead was able to obtain a post at the university of michigan in  at the university of michigan mead met charles h cooley and john dewey both of whom would influence him greatly in  mead moved along with dewey to the university of chicago where he taught until his death deweys influence led mead into educational theory but his thinking soon diverged from that of dewey and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind self and society– no detached philosopher he was active in chicagos social and political affairs among his many activities include his work for the city club of chicago he believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in chicago he also worked as treasurer for chicagos hull house mead died of heart failure on april   writingsedit in a career spanning more than  years mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology however he did not publish any books following his death several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of meads social psychology course at the university of chicago his lecture notes and his numerous unpublished papers the four volumes are meads  carus lectures edited by charles w morris the philosophy of the present  edited by arthur e murphy mind self and society  edited by charles w morris movements of thought in the nineteenth century  edited by merritt h moore and the philosophy of the act  most notable among meads published papers are “suggestions towards a theory of the philosophical disciplines”  “social consciousness and the consciousness of meaning”  “what social objects must psychology presuppose”  “the mechanism of social consciousness”  “the social self”  “scientific method and the individual thinker” “a behavioristic account of the significant symbol”  “the genesis of self and social control”   “the objective reality of perspectives”  ”the nature of the past”   and “the philosophies of royce james and dewey in their american setting”   in his lifetime mead published around  scholarly articles reviews and incidental pieces given their diverse nature access to these writings is difficult the first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the s in  andrew j reck collected twentyfive of mead’s published articles in selected writings george herbert mead bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press   four years later john w petras published george herbert mead essays on his social psychology a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts more recently mary jo deegan published essays in social psychology  a book project originally abandoned by mead in the early s in  filipe carreira da silva edited the gh mead a reader the most comprehensive collection to date it includes thirty of mead’s most important articles ten of which previously unpublished the mead project at brock university in ontario intends to publish all of meads odd remaining unpublished manuscripts pragmatism and symbolic interactionedit much of meads work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm he insisted that the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings mead   the two most important roots of meads work and of symbolic interactionism in general are the philosophy of pragmatism and social as opposed to psychological behaviorism ie mead was concerned with the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli pragmatism is a wideranging philosophical position from which several aspects of meads influences can be identified there are four main tenets of pragmatism see internet encyclopedia of philosophy first to pragmatists true reality does not exist out there in the real world it is actively created as we act in and toward the world second people remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer works third people define the social and physical objects they encounter in the world according to their use for them lastly if we want to understand actors we must base that understanding on what people actually do three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and the actors ability to interpret the social world thus to mead and symbolic interactionists consciousness is not separated from action and interaction but is an integral part of both symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of transactionalism meads theories in part based on pragmatism and behaviorism were transmitted to many graduate students at the university of chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism– social philosophy behaviorismedit mead was a very important figure in th century social philosophy one of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms discussed in mind self and society also known as social behaviorism this concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology rooted intellectually in hegelian dialectics and process philosophy mead like dewey developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action human activity is in a pragmatic sense the criterion of truth and through human activity meaning is made joint activity including

raised in a protestant middleclass family comprising his father hiram mead his mother elizabeth storrs billings mead and his sister alice his father was a former congregationalist pastor from a lineage of farmers and clergymen and who later held the chair in sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology at oberlin college’s theological seminary elizabeth storrs mead taught for two years at oberlin college and subsequently from  to  served as president of mount holyoke college in south hadley massachusetts in  george mead enrolled at oberlin college graduating in  with a ba degree after graduation mead taught grade school for about four months for the following three years he worked as a surveyor for the wisconsin central railroad company in autumn  mead enrolled at harvard university where his main interests were philosophy and psychology at harvard mead studied with josiah royce a major influence upon his thought and william james whose children he tutored in  mead left harvard after receiving only a ba and moved to leipzig germany to study with psychologist wilhelm wundt from whom he learned the concept of the gesture a concept central to his later work in  he married helen kingsbury castle – the sister of henry northrup castle – a friend he met at oberlin despite never finishing his dissertation mead was able to obtain a post at the university of michigan in  at the university of michigan mead met charles h cooley and john dewey both of whom would influence him greatly in  mead moved along with dewey to the university of chicago where he taught until his death deweys influence led mead into educational theory but his thinking soon diverged from that of dewey and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind self and society– no detached philosopher he was active in chicagos social and political affairs among his many activities include his work for the city club of chicago he believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in chicago he also worked as treasurer for chicagos hull house mead died of heart failure on april   writingsedit in a career spanning more than  years mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology however he did not publish any books following his death several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of meads social psychology course at the university of chicago his lecture notes and his numerous unpublished papers the four volumes are meads  carus lectures edited by charles w morris the philosophy of the present  edited by arthur e murphy mind self and society  edited by charles w morris movements of thought in the nineteenth century  edited by merritt h moore and the philosophy of the act  most notable among meads published papers are “suggestions towards a theory of the philosophical disciplines”  “social consciousness and the consciousness of meaning”  “what social objects must psychology presuppose”  “the mechanism of social consciousness”  “the social self”  “scientific method and the individual thinker” “a behavioristic account of the significant symbol”  “the genesis of self and social control”   “the objective reality of perspectives”  ”the nature of the past”   and “the philosophies of royce james and dewey in their american setting”   in his lifetime mead published around  scholarly articles reviews and incidental pieces given their diverse nature access to these writings is difficult the first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the s in  andrew j reck collected twentyfive of mead’s published articles in selected writings george herbert mead bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press   four years later john w petras published george herbert mead essays on his social psychology a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts more recently mary jo deegan published essays in social psychology  a book project originally abandoned by mead in the early s in  filipe carreira da silva edited the gh mead a reader the most comprehensive collection to date it includes thirty of mead’s most important articles ten of which previously unpublished the mead project at brock university in ontario intends to publish all of meads odd remaining unpublished manuscripts pragmatism and symbolic interactionedit much of meads work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm he insisted that the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings mead   the two most important roots of meads work and of symbolic interactionism in general are the philosophy of pragmatism and social as opposed to psychological behaviorism ie mead was concerned with the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli pragmatism is a wideranging philosophical position from which several aspects of meads influences can be identified there are four main tenets of pragmatism see internet encyclopedia of philosophy first to pragmatists true reality does not exist out there in the real world it is actively created as we act in and toward the world second people remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer works third people define the social and physical objects they encounter in the world according to their use for them lastly if we want to understand actors we must base that understanding on what people actually do three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and the actors ability to interpret the social world thus to mead and symbolic interactionists consciousness is not separated from action and interaction but is an integral part of both symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of transactionalism meads theories in part based on pragmatism and behaviorism were transmitted to many graduate students at the university of chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism– social philosophy behaviorismedit mead was a very important figure in th century social philosophy one of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms discussed in mind self and society also known as social behaviorism this concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology rooted intellectually in hegelian dialectics and process philosophy mead like dewey developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action human activity is in a pragmatic sense the criterion of truth and through human activity meaning is made joint activity including communicative activity is the means through which our sense of self is constituted the essence of meads social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure this approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in mead’s terms is the individualized focus of the communication process it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no “mind or thought without language” and language the content of mind “is only a development and product of social interaction” mind self and society  thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is emergent in “the dynamic ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience mind self and society  for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication mead’s concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of “mind self and society” is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment action is very important to his social theory and according to mead actions also occur within a communicative process the initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture a gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism the rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person on this level no communication occurs neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other the gestures are nonsignificant for communication to take place each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act here the gestures are significant symbols a significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication– mead grounded human perception in an actionnexus joas   we perceive the world in terms of the “means of living” mead   to perceive food is to perceive eating to perceive a house is to perceive shelter that is to say perception is in terms of action meads theory of perception is similar to that of j j gibson mead the social psychologist argued in tune with durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing preexisting society or more specifically social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society the self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves mead argued that we are objects first to other people and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people and thus through language we become other to ourselves in joint activity which mead called social acts humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their coactors a central mechanism within the social act which enables perspective taking is position exchange people within a social act often alternate social positions eg givingreceiving askinghelping winninglosing hidingseeking talkinglistening in childrens games there is repeated position exchange for example in hideandseek and mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops however for mead unlike john dewey and j j gibson the key is not simply human action but rather social action in humans the manipulatory phase of the act is socially mediated that is to say in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object this is what mead means by the social act as opposed to simply the act the latter being a deweyan concept nonhuman animals also manipulate objects but that is a nonsocial manipulation they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object humans on the other hand take the perspective of other actors towards objects and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination in the social act of economic exchange for example both buyer and seller must take each others perspectives towards the object being exchanged the seller must recognize the value for the buyer while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur mead was influenced on this point by adam smith nature of the selfedit a final piece of meads social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process mead states the self is a social process meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate ones complete self as previously discussed mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process as gestures are taken in by the individual organism the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others in the form of gestures and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes this process is characterized by mead as the i and the me the me is the social self and the i is the response to the me in other words the i is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others while the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes mead develops william james distinction between the i and the me the me is the accumulated understanding of the generalized other ie how one thinks ones group perceives oneself etc the i is the individuals impulses the i is self as subject the me is self as object the i is the knower the me is the known the mind or stream of thought is the selfreflective movements of the interaction between the i and the me there is neither i nor me in the conversation of gestures the whole act is not yet carried out but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture these dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense and form the basis of a theory of human cognition for mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the i and the me mead rooted the self’s “perception and meaning” deeply and sociologically in a common praxis of subjects joas   found specifically in social encounters understood as a combination of the i and the me mead’s self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence for mead existence in community comes before individual consciousness first one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become selfconscious philosophy of scienceedit mead is a major american philosopher by virtue of being along with john dewey charles peirce and william james one of the founders of pragmatism he also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature science and history to philosophical anthropology and to process philosophy dewey and alfred north whitehead considered mead a thinker of the first rank he is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries as far as his work on the philosophy of science mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment the notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience there is a social relation to inanimate objects for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly or that it manipulates indirectly in perception for example in taking introjecting or imitating the resistant role of a solid object an individual obtains cognition of what is inside nonliving things historically the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe contact experience includes experiences of position balance and support and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world our scientific concepts of space time and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation in developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature the conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement in the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs the ultimate in experience however is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act play and game and the generalized otheredit mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through play and game play comes first in the childs development the child takes different roles heshe observes in adult society and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles for instance he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing cops and robbers and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing doctor as a result of such play the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self however it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves in the next stage the game stage it is required that a person develop a full sense of self whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game furthermore these roles must have a definite relationship to one another to illustrate the game stage mead gives his famous example of a baseball game but in a game where a number of individuals are involved then the child taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else if he gets in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his own position he must know what everyone else is going to do in order to carry out his own play he has to take all of these roles they do not all have to be present in consciousness at the same time but at some moments he has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude such as the one who is going to throw the ball the one who is going to catch it and so on these responses must be in some degree present in his own makeup in the game then there is a set of responses of such others so organized that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other mead  in the game stage organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly to determine what they will do within a specific group– mead calls this the childs first encounter with the generalized other which is one of the main concepts mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the social self in human beings the generalized other can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity through understanding the generalized other the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected appropriate and so on in different social settings how does perspective taking occur according to mead it has been argued that social acts such as games and routine forms of social interaction enable perspective taking through position exchange assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives then it might be that by moving between roles in a game eg between hiding and seeking or buying and selling we come to learn about the perspective of the other this new interpretation of meads account of taking the

left harvard after receiving only a ba and moved to leipzig germany to study with psychologist wilhelm wundt from whom he learned the concept of the gesture a concept central to his later work in  he married helen kingsbury castle – the sister of henry northrup castle – a friend he met at oberlin despite never finishing his dissertation mead was able to obtain a post at the university of michigan in  at the university of michigan mead met charles h cooley and john dewey both of whom would influence him greatly in  mead moved along with dewey to the university of chicago where he taught until his death deweys influence led mead into educational theory but his thinking soon diverged from that of dewey and developed into his famous psychological theories of mind self and society– no detached philosopher he was active in chicagos social and political affairs among his many activities include his work for the city club of chicago he believed that science could be used to deal with social problems and played a key role in conducting research at the settlement house in chicago he also worked as treasurer for chicagos hull house mead died of heart failure on april   writingsedit in a career spanning more than  years mead wrote almost constantly and published numerous articles and book reviews in both philosophy and psychology however he did not publish any books following his death several of his students put together and edited four volumes from records of meads social psychology course at the university of chicago his lecture notes and his numerous unpublished papers the four volumes are meads  carus lectures edited by charles w morris the philosophy of the present  edited by arthur e murphy mind self and society  edited by charles w morris movements of thought in the nineteenth century  edited by merritt h moore and the philosophy of the act  most notable among meads published papers are “suggestions towards a theory of the philosophical disciplines”  “social consciousness and the consciousness of meaning”  “what social objects must psychology presuppose”  “the mechanism of social consciousness”  “the social self”  “scientific method and the individual thinker” “a behavioristic account of the significant symbol”  “the genesis of self and social control”   “the objective reality of perspectives”  ”the nature of the past”   and “the philosophies of royce james and dewey in their american setting”   in his lifetime mead published around  scholarly articles reviews and incidental pieces given their diverse nature access to these writings is difficult the first editorial efforts to change this situation date from the s in  andrew j reck collected twentyfive of mead’s published articles in selected writings george herbert mead bobbsmerrill the liberal arts press   four years later john w petras published george herbert mead essays on his social psychology a collection of fifteen articles that included previously unpublished manuscripts more recently mary jo deegan published essays in social psychology  a book project originally abandoned by mead in the early s in  filipe carreira da silva edited the gh mead a reader the most comprehensive collection to date it includes thirty of mead’s most important articles ten of which previously unpublished the mead project at brock university in ontario intends to publish all of meads odd remaining unpublished manuscripts pragmatism and symbolic interactionedit much of meads work focused on the development of the self and the objectivity of the world within the social realm he insisted that the individual mind can exist only in relation to other minds with shared meanings mead   the two most important roots of meads work and of symbolic interactionism in general are the philosophy of pragmatism and social as opposed to psychological behaviorism ie mead was concerned with the stimuli of gestures and social objects with rich meanings rather than bare physical objects which psychological behaviourists considered stimuli pragmatism is a wideranging philosophical position from which several aspects of meads influences can be identified there are four main tenets of pragmatism see internet encyclopedia of philosophy first to pragmatists true reality does not exist out there in the real world it is actively created as we act in and toward the world second people remember and base their knowledge of the world on what has been useful to them and are likely to alter what no longer works third people define the social and physical objects they encounter in the world according to their use for them lastly if we want to understand actors we must base that understanding on what people actually do three of these ideas are critical to symbolic interactionism the focus on the interaction between the actor and the world a view of both the actor and the world as dynamic processes and not static structures and the actors ability to interpret the social world thus to mead and symbolic interactionists consciousness is not separated from action and interaction but is an integral part of both symbolic interactionism as a pragmatic philosophy was an antecedent to the philosophy of transactionalism meads theories in part based on pragmatism and behaviorism were transmitted to many graduate students at the university of chicago who then went on to establish symbolic interactionism– social philosophy behaviorismedit mead was a very important figure in th century social philosophy one of his most influential ideas was the emergence of mind and self from the communication process between organisms discussed in mind self and society also known as social behaviorism this concept of how the mind and self emerge from the social process of communication by signs founded the symbolic interactionist school of sociology rooted intellectually in hegelian dialectics and process philosophy mead like dewey developed a more materialist process philosophy that was based upon human action and specifically communicative action human activity is in a pragmatic sense the criterion of truth and through human activity meaning is made joint activity including communicative activity is the means through which our sense of self is constituted the essence of meads social behaviorism is that mind is not a substance located in some transcendent realm nor is it merely a series of events that takes place within the human physiological structure this approach opposed the traditional view of the mind as separate from the body the emergence of mind is contingent upon interaction between the human organism and its social environment it is through participation in the social act of communication that individuals realize their potential for significantly symbolic behavior that is thought mind in mead’s terms is the individualized focus of the communication process it is linguistic behavior on the part of the individual there is then no “mind or thought without language” and language the content of mind “is only a development and product of social interaction” mind self and society  thus mind is not reducible to the neurophysiology of the organic individual but is emergent in “the dynamic ongoing social process” that constitutes human experience mind self and society  for mead mind arises out of the social act of communication mead’s concept of the social act is relevant not only to his theory of mind but to all facets of his social philosophy his theory of “mind self and society” is in effect a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of a social process involving the interaction of many individuals just as his theory of knowledge and value is a philosophy of the act from the standpoint of the experiencing individual in interaction with an environment action is very important to his social theory and according to mead actions also occur within a communicative process the initial phase of an act constitutes a gesture a gesture is a preparatory movement that enables other individuals to become aware of the intentions of the given organism the rudimentary situation is a conversation of gestures in which a gesture on the part of the first individual evokes a preparatory movement on the part of the second and the gesture of the second organism in turn calls out a response in the first person on this level no communication occurs neither organism is aware of the effect of its own gestures upon the other the gestures are nonsignificant for communication to take place each organism must have knowledge of how the other individual will respond to his own ongoing act here the gestures are significant symbols a significant symbol is a kind of gesture that only humans can make gestures become significant symbols when they arouse in the individual who is making them the same kind of response they are supposed to elicit from those to whom the gestures are addressed only when we have significant symbols can we truly have communication– mead grounded human perception in an actionnexus joas   we perceive the world in terms of the “means of living” mead   to perceive food is to perceive eating to perceive a house is to perceive shelter that is to say perception is in terms of action meads theory of perception is similar to that of j j gibson mead the social psychologist argued in tune with durkheim that the individual is a product of an ongoing preexisting society or more specifically social interaction that is a consequence of a sui generis society the self arises when the individual becomes an object to themselves mead argued that we are objects first to other people and secondarily we become objects to ourselves by taking the perspective of other people language enables us to talk about ourselves in the same way as we talk about other people and thus through language we become other to ourselves in joint activity which mead called social acts humans learn to see themselves from the standpoint of their coactors a central mechanism within the social act which enables perspective taking is position exchange people within a social act often alternate social positions eg givingreceiving askinghelping winninglosing hidingseeking talkinglistening in childrens games there is repeated position exchange for example in hideandseek and mead argued that this is one of the main ways that perspective taking develops however for mead unlike john dewey and j j gibson the key is not simply human action but rather social action in humans the manipulatory phase of the act is socially mediated that is to say in acting towards objects humans simultaneously take the perspectives of others towards that object this is what mead means by the social act as opposed to simply the act the latter being a deweyan concept nonhuman animals also manipulate objects but that is a nonsocial manipulation they do not take the perspective of other organisms toward the object humans on the other hand take the perspective of other actors towards objects and this is what enables complex human society and subtle social coordination in the social act of economic exchange for example both buyer and seller must take each others perspectives towards the object being exchanged the seller must recognize the value for the buyer while the buyer must recognize the desirability of money for the seller only with this mutual perspective taking can the economic exchange occur mead was influenced on this point by adam smith nature of the selfedit a final piece of meads social theory is the mind as the individual importation of the social process mead states the self is a social process meaning that there are series of actions that go on in the mind to help formulate ones complete self as previously discussed mead presented the self and the mind in terms of a social process as gestures are taken in by the individual organism the individual organism also takes in the collective attitudes of others in the form of gestures and reacts accordingly with other organized attitudes this process is characterized by mead as the i and the me the me is the social self and the i is the response to the me in other words the i is the response of an individual to the attitudes of others while the me is the organized set of attitudes of others which an individual assumes mead develops william james distinction between the i and the me the me is the accumulated understanding of the generalized other ie how one thinks ones group perceives oneself etc the i is the individuals impulses the i is self as subject the me is self as object the i is the knower the me is the known the mind or stream of thought is the selfreflective movements of the interaction between the i and the me there is neither i nor me in the conversation of gestures the whole act is not yet carried out but the preparation takes place in this field of gesture these dynamics go beyond selfhood in a narrow sense and form the basis of a theory of human cognition for mead the thinking process is the internalized dialogue between the i and the me mead rooted the self’s “perception and meaning” deeply and sociologically in a common praxis of subjects joas   found specifically in social encounters understood as a combination of the i and the me mead’s self proves to be noticeably entwined within a sociological existence for mead existence in community comes before individual consciousness first one must participate in the different social positions within society and only subsequently can one use that experience to take the perspective of others and thus become selfconscious philosophy of scienceedit mead is a major american philosopher by virtue of being along with john dewey charles peirce and william james one of the founders of pragmatism he also made significant contributions to the philosophies of nature science and history to philosophical anthropology and to process philosophy dewey and alfred north whitehead considered mead a thinker of the first rank he is a classic example of a social theorist whose work does not fit easily within conventional disciplinary boundaries as far as his work on the philosophy of science mead sought to find the psychological origin of science in the efforts of individuals to attain power over their environment the notion of a physical object arises out of manipulatory experience there is a social relation to inanimate objects for the organism takes the role of things that it manipulates directly or that it manipulates indirectly in perception for example in taking introjecting or imitating the resistant role of a solid object an individual obtains cognition of what is inside nonliving things historically the concept of the physical object arose from an animistic conception of the universe contact experience includes experiences of position balance and support and these are used by the organism when it creates its conceptions of the physical world our scientific concepts of space time and mass are abstracted from manipulatory experience such concepts as that of the electron are also derived from manipulation in developing a science we construct hypothetical objects in order to assist ourselves in controlling nature the conception of the present as a distinct unit of experience rather than as a process of becoming and disappearing is a scientific fiction devised to facilitate exact measurement in the scientific worldview immediate experience is replaced by theoretical constructs the ultimate in experience however is the manipulation and contact at the completion of an act play and game and the generalized otheredit mead theorized that human beings begin their understanding of the social world through play and game play comes first in the childs development the child takes different roles heshe observes in adult society and plays them out to gain an understanding of the different social roles for instance he first plays the role of policeman and then the role of thief while playing cops and robbers and plays the role of doctor and patient when playing doctor as a result of such play the child learns to become both subject and object and begins to become able to build a self however it is a limited self because the child can only take the role of distinct and separate others they still lack a more general and organized sense of themselves in the next stage the game stage it is required that a person develop a full sense of self whereas in the play stage the child takes on the role of distinct others in the game stage the child must take the role of everyone else involved in the game furthermore these roles must have a definite relationship to one another to illustrate the game stage mead gives his famous example of a baseball game but in a game where a number of individuals are involved then the child taking one role must be ready to take the role of everyone else if he gets in a ball nine he must have the responses of each position involved in his own position he must know what everyone else is going to do in order to carry out his own play he has to take all of these roles they do not all have to be present in consciousness at the same time but at some moments he has to have three or four individuals present in his own attitude such as the one who is going to throw the ball the one who is going to catch it and so on these responses must be in some degree present in his own makeup in the game then there is a set of responses of such others so organized that the attitude of one calls out the appropriate attitudes of the other mead  in the game stage organization begins and definite personalities start to emerge children begin to become able to function in organized groups and most importantly to determine what they will do within a specific group– mead calls this the childs first encounter with the generalized other which is one of the main concepts mead proposes for understanding the emergence of the social self in human beings the generalized other can be thought of as understanding the given activity and the actors place within the activity from the perspective of all the others engaged in the activity through understanding the generalized other the individual understands what kind of behavior is expected appropriate and so on in different social settings how does perspective taking occur according to mead it has been argued that social acts such as games and routine forms of social interaction enable perspective taking through position exchange assuming that games and routine social acts have differentiated social positions and that these positions create our cognitive perspectives then it might be that by moving between roles in a game eg between hiding and seeking or buying and selling we come to learn about the perspective of the other this new interpretation of meads account of taking the perspective of the other has experimental support bibliographyedit  the philosophy of the present open court publishing  mind self and society ed by charles w morris university of chicago press isbn

ttivanguard carver andress mead born  may  is a us scientist and engineer he currently holds the position of gordon and betty moore professor emeritus of engineering and applied science at the california institute of technology caltech having taught there for over  years mead is an enthusiastic instructor and he advised the first female electrical engineering student at caltech louise kirkbride his contributions as a teacher include the classic textbook introduction to vlsi design  which he coauthored with lynn conway a pioneer of modern microelectronics he has made contributions to the development and design of semiconductors digital chips and silicon compilers technologies which form the foundations of modern verylargescale integration chip design in the s he focused on electronic modelling of human neurology and biology creating neuromorphic electronic systems mead has been involved in the founding of more than  companies most recently he has called for the reconceptualization of modern physics revisiting the theoretical debates of niels bohr albert einstein and others in light of later experiments and developments in instrumentation contents  early life

hydroelectric project owned by southern california edison company carver attended a tiny local school for some years then moved to fresno california to live with his grandmother so that he could attend a larger high school he became interested in electricity and electronics while very young seeing the work at the power plant experimenting with electrical equipment qualifying for an amateur radio license and in high school working at local radio stations mead studied electrical engineering at caltech getting his bs in  his ms in  and his phd degree in  microelectronicsedit meads contributions have arisen from the application of basic physics to the development of electronic devices often in novel ways during the s he carried out systematic investigations into the energy behavior of electrons in insulators and semiconductors developing a deep understanding of electron tunneling barrier behavior and hotelectron transport in  he was the first person to describe and demonstrate a threeterminal solidstate device based on the operating principles of electron tunnelling and hotelectron transport in  he demonstrated that using tunnel emission hot electrons retained energy when traveling nanometer distances in gold his studies of iiiv compounds with w g spitzer established the importance of interface states laying the groundwork for bandgap engineering and the development of heterojunction devices gaas mesfetedit in  mead designed the first gallium arsenide gate fieldeffect transistor using a schottky barrier diode to isolate the gate from the channel as a material gaas offers much higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than silicon the gaas mesfet became the dominant microwave semiconductor device used in a variety of highfrequency wireless electronics including microwave communication systems in radio telescopes satellite dishes and cellular phones carvers work on mesfets also became the basis for the later development of hemts highelectronmobility transistors by fujitsu in  hemts like mesfets are accumulationmode devices used in microwave receivers and telecommunication systems moores lawedit mead is credited by gordon moore with coining the term moores law to denote the prediction moore made in  about the growth rate of the component count a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor fitting on a single integrated circuit moore and mead began collaborating around  when moore gave mead cosmetic reject transistors from fairchild semiconductor for his students to use in his classes during the s mead made weekly visits to fairchild visiting the research and development labs and discussing their work with moore during one of their discussions moore asked mead whether electron tunneling might limit the size of a workable transistor when told that it would he asked what the limit would be stimulated by moores question mead and his students began a physicsbased analysis of possible materials trying to determine a lower bound for moores law in  mead demonstrated contrary to common assumptions that as transistors decreased in size they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower rather he argued that transistors would get faster better cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized his results were initially met with considerable skepticism but as designers experimented more and more results supported his assertion in  mead and graduate student bruce hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as  microns this lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected despite initial doubts meads prediction influenced the computer industrys development of submicron technology when meads predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in  the transistor was highly similar to the one mead had originally described mead–conway vlsi designedit mead was the first to predict the possibility of storing millions of transistors on a chip his prediction implied that substantial changes in technology would have to occur to achieve such scalability mead was one of the first researchers to investigate techniques for verylargescale integration designing and creating highcomplexity microchips he taught the worlds first vlsi design course at caltech in  throughout the s with involvement and feedback from a succession of classes mead developed his ideas of integrated circuit and system design he worked with ivan sutherland and frederick b thompson to establish computer science as a department at caltech which formally occurred in  also in  mead coauthored a darpa report with ivan sutherland and thomas eugene everhart assessing the limitations of current microelectronics fabrication and recommending research into the system design implications of verylargescale integrated circuits beginning in  carver mead collaborated with lynn conway from xerox parc they developed the landmark text introduction to vlsi systems published in  an important spearhead of the mead  conway revolution a pioneering textbook it has been used in vlsi integrated circuit education all over the world for decades the circulation of early preprint chapters in classes and among other researchers attracted widespread interest and created a community of people interested in the approach they also demonstrated the feasibility of multiproject sharedwafer methodology creating chips for students in their classes their work caused a paradigm shift a fundamental reassessment of the development of integrated circuits and revolutionized the world of computers in  mead and conway received the award for achievement from electronics magazine in recognition of their contributions more than  years later the impact of their work is still being assessed building on the ideas of vlsi design mead and his phd student david l johannsen created the first silicon compiler capable of taking a users specifications and automatically generating an integrated circuit mead johannsen edmund k cheng and others formed silicon compilers inc sci in  sci designed one of the key chips for digital equipment corporation’s microvax minicomputer mead and conway laid the groundwork for the development of the mosis metal oxide semiconductor implementation service and the fabrication of the first cmos chip mead advocated for the idea of fabless manufacturing in which customers specify their design needs to fabless semiconductor companies the companies then design specialpurpose chips and outsource the chip fabrication to less expensive overseas semiconductor foundries neural models of computingedit next carver mead began to explore the potential for modelling biological systems of computation both animal and human brains his interest in biological models dated back at least to  when he met biophysicist max delbrück delbrück had stimulated meads interest in transducer physiology the transformations that occur between the physical input initiating a perceptual process and eventual perceptual phenomena observing graded synaptic transmission in the retina mead became interested in the potential to treat transistors as analog devices rather than digital switches he noted parallels between charges moving in mos transistors operated in weak inversion and charges flowing across the membranes of neurons he worked with professor john hopfield and nobelist richard feynman helping to create three new fields neural networks neuromorphic engineering and the physics of computation mead considered a founder of neuromorphic engineering is credited with coining the term neuromorphic processors developing this new direction mead was successful in finding venture capital funding to support the start of a number of companies in part due to an early connection with arnold beckman chairman of the caltech board of trustees mead has said that his preferred approach to development is technology push exploring something interesting and then developing useful applications for it touchedit in  mead and federico faggin founded synaptics inc to develop analog circuits based in neural networking theories suitable for use in vision and speech recognition the first product that synaptics brought to market was a pressuresensitive computer touchpad a form of sensing technology that rapidly replaced the trackball and mouse in laptop computers the synaptics touchpad was extremely successful at one point capturing  of the touchpad market hearingedit in  richard francis lyon and carver mead described the creation of an analog cochlea modelling the fluiddynamic travelingwave system of the auditory portion of the inner ear lyon had previously described a computational model for the work of the cochlea such technology had potential applications in hearing aids cochlear implants and a variety of speechrecognition devices their work has inspired ongoing research attempting to create a silicon analog that can emulate the signal processing capacities of a biological cochlea in  mead helped to form sonix technologies inc later sonic innovations inc founded by brigham young university professors doug chabries and richard christiansen in salt lake city utah mead designed the computer chip for their hearing aids in addition to being small the chip was said to be the most powerful used in a hearing aid release of the companys first product the natura hearing aid occurred in september  visionedit in the late s mead advised misha mahowald a phd student in computation and neural systems to develop the silicon retina using analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells cone cells and other nonphotoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye her  thesis received caltechs milton and francis clauser doctoral prize for its originality and potential for opening up new avenues of human thought and endeavor as of update her work was considered the best attempt to date to develop a stereoscopic vision system mead went on to describe an adaptive silicon retina using a twodimensional resistive network to model the first layer of visual processing in the outer plexiform layer of the retina around  mead and others established foveon inc in santa clara california to develop new digital camera technology based on neurallyinspired cmos image sensorprocessing chips the image sensors in the foveon x digital camera capture multiple colors for each pixel detecting red green and blue at different levels in the silicon sensor this provides more complete information and better quality photos compared to standard cameras that detect one color per pixel it has been hailed as revolutionary in  carver mead richard b merrill and richard francis lyon of foveon were awarded the progress medal of the royal photographic society for the development of the foveon x sensor synapsesedit meads work underlies the development of computer processors whose electronic components are connected in ways that resemble biological synapses in  and  mead hasler diorio and minch presented single transistor silicon synapses capable of analog learning applications and longterm memory storage carver pioneered the use of floatinggate transistors as a means of nonvolatile storage for neuromorphic and other analog circuits mead and diorio went on to

the official acm carver mead presents the universe and us an integrated theory of electromagnetics and gravitation ttivanguard carver andress mead born  may  is a us scientist and engineer he currently holds the position of gordon and betty moore professor emeritus of engineering and applied science at the california institute of technology caltech having taught there for over  years mead is an enthusiastic instructor and he advised the first female electrical engineering student at caltech louise kirkbride his contributions as a teacher include the classic textbook introduction to vlsi design  which he coauthored with lynn conway a pioneer of modern microelectronics he has made contributions to the development and design of semiconductors digital chips and silicon compilers technologies which form the foundations of modern verylargescale integration chip design in the s he focused on electronic modelling of human neurology and biology creating neuromorphic electronic systems mead has been involved in the founding of more than  companies most recently he has called for the reconceptualization of modern physics revisiting the theoretical debates of niels bohr albert einstein and others in light of later experiments and developments in instrumentation contents  early life and education  microelectronics  gaas mesfet  moores law  mead–conway vlsi design  neural models of computing  touch  hearing  vision  synapses  reconceptualizing physics  companies  awards  external links  references early life and educationedit carver andress mead was born in bakersfield california and grew up in kernville california his father worked in a power plant at the big creek hydroelectric project owned by southern california edison company carver attended a tiny local school for some years then moved to fresno california to live with his grandmother so that he could attend a larger high school he became interested in electricity and electronics while very young seeing the work at the power plant experimenting with electrical equipment qualifying for an amateur radio license and in high school working at local radio stations mead studied electrical engineering at caltech getting his bs in  his ms in  and his phd degree in  microelectronicsedit meads contributions have arisen from the application of basic physics to the development of electronic devices often in novel ways during the s he carried out systematic investigations into the energy behavior of electrons in insulators and semiconductors developing a deep understanding of electron tunneling barrier behavior and hotelectron transport in  he was the first person to describe and demonstrate a threeterminal solidstate device based on the operating principles of electron tunnelling and hotelectron transport in  he demonstrated that using tunnel emission hot electrons retained energy when traveling nanometer distances in gold his studies of iiiv compounds with w g spitzer established the importance of interface states laying the groundwork for bandgap engineering and the development of heterojunction devices gaas mesfetedit in  mead designed the first gallium arsenide gate fieldeffect transistor using a schottky barrier diode to isolate the gate from the channel as a material gaas offers much higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than silicon the gaas mesfet became the dominant microwave semiconductor device used in a variety of highfrequency wireless electronics including microwave communication systems in radio telescopes satellite dishes and cellular phones carvers work on mesfets also became the basis for the later development of hemts highelectronmobility transistors by fujitsu in  hemts like mesfets are accumulationmode devices used in microwave receivers and telecommunication systems moores lawedit mead is credited by gordon moore with coining the term moores law to denote the prediction moore made in  about the growth rate of the component count a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor fitting on a single integrated circuit moore and mead began collaborating around  when moore gave mead cosmetic reject transistors from fairchild semiconductor for his students to use in his classes during the s mead made weekly visits to fairchild visiting the research and development labs and discussing their work with moore during one of their discussions moore asked mead whether electron tunneling might limit the size of a workable transistor when told that it would he asked what the limit would be stimulated by moores question mead and his students began a physicsbased analysis of possible materials trying to determine a lower bound for moores law in  mead demonstrated contrary to common assumptions that as transistors decreased in size they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower rather he argued that transistors would get faster better cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized his results were initially met with considerable skepticism but as designers experimented more and more results supported his assertion in  mead and graduate student bruce hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as  microns this lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected despite initial doubts meads prediction influenced the computer industrys development of submicron technology when meads predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in  the transistor was highly similar to the one mead had originally described mead–conway vlsi designedit mead was the first to predict the possibility of storing millions of transistors on a chip his prediction implied that substantial changes in technology would have to occur to achieve such scalability mead was one of the first researchers to investigate techniques for verylargescale integration designing and creating highcomplexity microchips he taught the worlds first vlsi design course at caltech in  throughout the s with involvement and feedback from a succession of classes mead developed his ideas of integrated circuit and system design he worked with ivan sutherland and frederick b thompson to establish computer science as a department at caltech which formally occurred in  also in  mead coauthored a darpa report with ivan sutherland and thomas eugene everhart assessing the limitations of current microelectronics fabrication and recommending research into the system design implications of verylargescale integrated circuits beginning in  carver mead collaborated with lynn conway from xerox parc they developed the landmark text introduction to vlsi systems published in  an important spearhead of the mead  conway revolution a pioneering textbook it has been used in vlsi integrated circuit education all over the world for decades the circulation of early preprint chapters in classes and among other researchers attracted widespread interest and created a community of people interested in the approach they also demonstrated the feasibility of multiproject sharedwafer methodology creating chips for students in their classes their work caused a paradigm shift a fundamental reassessment of the development of integrated circuits and revolutionized the world of computers in  mead and conway received the award for achievement from electronics magazine in recognition of their contributions more than  years later the impact of their work is still being assessed building on the ideas of vlsi design mead and his phd student david l johannsen created the first silicon compiler capable of taking a users specifications and automatically generating an integrated circuit mead johannsen edmund k cheng and others formed silicon compilers inc sci in  sci designed one of the key chips for digital equipment corporation’s microvax minicomputer mead and conway laid the groundwork for the development of the mosis metal oxide semiconductor implementation service and the fabrication of the first cmos chip mead advocated for the idea of fabless manufacturing in which customers specify their design needs to fabless semiconductor companies the companies then design specialpurpose chips and outsource the chip fabrication to less expensive overseas semiconductor foundries neural models of computingedit next carver mead began to explore the potential for modelling biological systems of computation both animal and human brains his interest in biological models dated back at least to  when he met biophysicist max delbrück delbrück had stimulated meads interest in transducer physiology the transformations that occur between the physical input initiating a perceptual process and eventual perceptual phenomena observing graded synaptic transmission in the retina mead became interested in the potential to treat transistors as analog devices rather than digital switches he noted parallels between charges moving in mos transistors operated in weak inversion and charges flowing across the membranes of neurons he worked with professor john hopfield and nobelist richard feynman helping to create three new fields neural networks neuromorphic engineering and the physics of computation mead considered a founder of neuromorphic engineering is credited with coining the term neuromorphic processors developing this new direction mead was successful in finding venture capital funding to support the start of a number of companies in part due to an early connection with arnold beckman chairman of the caltech board of trustees mead has said that his preferred approach to development is technology push exploring something interesting and then developing useful applications for it touchedit in  mead and federico faggin founded synaptics inc to develop analog circuits based in neural networking theories suitable for use in vision and speech recognition the first product that synaptics brought to market was a pressuresensitive computer touchpad a form of sensing technology that rapidly replaced the trackball and mouse in laptop computers the synaptics touchpad was extremely successful at one point capturing  of the touchpad market hearingedit in  richard francis lyon and carver mead described the creation of an analog cochlea modelling the fluiddynamic travelingwave system of the auditory portion of the inner ear lyon had previously described a computational model for the work of the cochlea such technology had potential applications in hearing aids cochlear implants and a variety of speechrecognition devices their work has inspired ongoing research attempting to create a silicon analog that can emulate the signal processing capacities of a biological cochlea in  mead helped to form sonix technologies inc later sonic innovations inc founded by brigham young university professors doug chabries and richard christiansen in salt lake city utah mead designed the computer chip for their hearing aids in addition to being small the chip was said to be the most powerful used in a hearing aid release of the companys first product the natura hearing aid occurred in september  visionedit in the late s mead advised misha mahowald a phd student in computation and neural systems to develop the silicon retina using analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells cone cells and other nonphotoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye her  thesis received caltechs milton and francis clauser doctoral prize for its originality and potential for opening up new avenues of human thought and endeavor as of update her work was considered the best attempt to date to develop a stereoscopic vision system mead went on to describe an adaptive silicon retina using a twodimensional resistive network to model the first layer of visual processing in the outer plexiform layer of the retina around  mead and others established foveon inc in santa clara california to develop new digital camera technology based on neurallyinspired cmos image sensorprocessing chips the image sensors in the foveon x digital camera capture multiple colors for each pixel detecting red green and blue at different levels in the silicon sensor this provides more complete information and better quality photos compared to standard cameras that detect one color per pixel it has been hailed as revolutionary in  carver mead richard b merrill and richard francis lyon of foveon were awarded the progress medal of the royal photographic society for the development of the foveon x sensor synapsesedit meads work underlies the development of computer processors whose electronic components are connected in ways that resemble biological synapses in  and  mead hasler diorio and minch presented single transistor silicon synapses capable of analog learning applications and longterm memory storage carver pioneered the use of floatinggate transistors as a means of nonvolatile storage for neuromorphic and other analog circuits mead and diorio went on to found impinj based on their work with floatinggate transistors using

father worked in a power plant at the big creek hydroelectric project owned by southern california edison company carver attended a tiny local school for some years then moved to fresno california to live with his grandmother so that he could attend a larger high school he became interested in electricity and electronics while very young seeing the work at the power plant experimenting with electrical equipment qualifying for an amateur radio license and in high school working at local radio stations mead studied electrical engineering at caltech getting his bs in  his ms in  and his phd degree in  microelectronicsedit meads contributions have arisen from the application of basic physics to the development of electronic devices often in novel ways during the s he carried out systematic investigations into the energy behavior of electrons in insulators and semiconductors developing a deep understanding of electron tunneling barrier behavior and hotelectron transport in  he was the first person to describe and demonstrate a threeterminal solidstate device based on the operating principles of electron tunnelling and hotelectron transport in  he demonstrated that using tunnel emission hot electrons retained energy when traveling nanometer distances in gold his studies of iiiv compounds with w g spitzer established the importance of interface states laying the groundwork for bandgap engineering and the development of heterojunction devices gaas mesfetedit in  mead designed the first gallium arsenide gate fieldeffect transistor using a schottky barrier diode to isolate the gate from the channel as a material gaas offers much higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than silicon the gaas mesfet became the dominant microwave semiconductor device used in a variety of highfrequency wireless electronics including microwave communication systems in radio telescopes satellite dishes and cellular phones carvers work on mesfets also became the basis for the later development of hemts highelectronmobility transistors by fujitsu in  hemts like mesfets are accumulationmode devices used in microwave receivers and telecommunication systems moores lawedit mead is credited by gordon moore with coining the term moores law to denote the prediction moore made in  about the growth rate of the component count a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor fitting on a single integrated circuit moore and mead began collaborating around  when moore gave mead cosmetic reject transistors from fairchild semiconductor for his students to use in his classes during the s mead made weekly visits to fairchild visiting the research and development labs and discussing their work with moore during one of their discussions moore asked mead whether electron tunneling might limit the size of a workable transistor when told that it would he asked what the limit would be stimulated by moores question mead and his students began a physicsbased analysis of possible materials trying to determine a lower bound for moores law in  mead demonstrated contrary to common assumptions that as transistors decreased in size they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower rather he argued that transistors would get faster better cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized his results were initially met with considerable skepticism but as designers experimented more and more results supported his assertion in  mead and graduate student bruce hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as  microns this lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected despite initial doubts meads prediction influenced the computer industrys development of submicron technology when meads predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in  the transistor was highly similar to the one mead had originally described mead–conway vlsi designedit mead was the first to predict the possibility of storing millions of transistors on a chip his prediction implied that substantial changes in technology would have to occur to achieve such scalability mead was one of the first researchers to investigate techniques for verylargescale integration designing and creating highcomplexity microchips he taught the worlds first vlsi design course at caltech in  throughout the s with involvement and feedback from a succession of classes mead developed his ideas of integrated circuit and system design he worked with ivan sutherland and frederick b thompson to establish computer science as a department at caltech which formally occurred in  also in  mead coauthored a darpa report with ivan sutherland and thomas eugene everhart assessing the limitations of current microelectronics fabrication and recommending research into the system design implications of verylargescale integrated circuits beginning in  carver mead collaborated with lynn conway from xerox parc they developed the landmark text introduction to vlsi systems published in  an important spearhead of the mead  conway revolution a pioneering textbook it has been used in vlsi integrated circuit education all over the world for decades the circulation of early preprint chapters in classes and among other researchers attracted widespread interest and created a community of people interested in the approach they also demonstrated the feasibility of multiproject sharedwafer methodology creating chips for students in their classes their work caused a paradigm shift a fundamental reassessment of the development of integrated circuits and revolutionized the world of computers in  mead and conway received the award for achievement from electronics magazine in recognition of their contributions more than  years later the impact of their work is still being assessed building on the ideas of vlsi design mead and his phd student david l johannsen created the first silicon compiler capable of taking a users specifications and automatically generating an integrated circuit mead johannsen edmund k cheng and others formed silicon compilers inc sci in  sci designed one of the key chips for digital equipment corporation’s microvax minicomputer mead and conway laid the groundwork for the development of the mosis metal oxide semiconductor implementation service and the fabrication of the first cmos chip mead advocated for the idea of fabless manufacturing in which customers specify their design needs to fabless semiconductor companies the companies then design specialpurpose chips and outsource the chip fabrication to less expensive overseas semiconductor foundries neural models of computingedit next carver mead began to explore the potential for modelling biological systems of computation both animal and human brains his interest in biological models dated back at least to  when he met biophysicist max delbrück delbrück had stimulated meads interest in transducer physiology the transformations that occur between the physical input initiating a perceptual process and eventual perceptual phenomena observing graded synaptic transmission in the retina mead became interested in the potential to treat transistors as analog devices rather than digital switches he noted parallels between charges moving in mos transistors operated in weak inversion and charges flowing across the membranes of neurons he worked with professor john hopfield and nobelist richard feynman helping to create three new fields neural networks neuromorphic engineering and the physics of computation mead considered a founder of neuromorphic engineering is credited with coining the term neuromorphic processors developing this new direction mead was successful in finding venture capital funding to support the start of a number of companies in part due to an early connection with arnold beckman chairman of the caltech board of trustees mead has said that his preferred approach to development is technology push exploring something interesting and then developing useful applications for it touchedit in  mead and federico faggin founded synaptics inc to develop analog circuits based in neural networking theories suitable for use in vision and speech recognition the first product that synaptics brought to market was a pressuresensitive computer touchpad a form of sensing technology that rapidly replaced the trackball and mouse in laptop computers the synaptics touchpad was extremely successful at one point capturing  of the touchpad market hearingedit in  richard francis lyon and carver mead described the creation of an analog cochlea modelling the fluiddynamic travelingwave system of the auditory portion of the inner ear lyon had previously described a computational model for the work of the cochlea such technology had potential applications in hearing aids cochlear implants and a variety of speechrecognition devices their work has inspired ongoing research attempting to create a silicon analog that can emulate the signal processing capacities of a biological cochlea in  mead helped to form sonix technologies inc later sonic innovations inc founded by brigham young university professors doug chabries and richard christiansen in salt lake city utah mead designed the computer chip for their hearing aids in addition to being small the chip was said to be the most powerful used in a hearing aid release of the companys first product the natura hearing aid occurred in september  visionedit in the late s mead advised misha mahowald a phd student in computation and neural systems to develop the silicon retina using analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells cone cells and other nonphotoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye her  thesis received caltechs milton and francis clauser doctoral prize for its originality and potential for opening up new avenues of human thought and endeavor as of update her work was considered the best attempt to date to develop a stereoscopic vision system mead went on to describe an adaptive silicon retina using a twodimensional resistive network to model the first layer of visual processing in the outer plexiform layer of the retina around  mead and others established foveon inc in santa clara california to develop new digital camera technology based on neurallyinspired cmos image sensorprocessing chips the image sensors in the foveon x digital camera capture multiple colors for each pixel detecting red green and blue at different levels in the silicon sensor this provides more complete information and better quality photos compared to standard cameras that detect one color per pixel it has been hailed as revolutionary in  carver mead richard b merrill and richard francis lyon of foveon were awarded the progress medal of the royal photographic society for the development of the foveon x sensor synapsesedit meads work underlies the development of computer processors whose electronic components are connected in ways that resemble biological synapses in  and  mead hasler diorio and minch presented single transistor silicon synapses capable of analog learning applications and longterm memory storage carver pioneered the use of floatinggate transistors as a means of nonvolatile storage for neuromorphic and other analog circuits mead and diorio went on to found impinj based on their work with floatinggate transistors using lowpower methods of storing charges on floatinggate transistors impinj developed applications for flash memory storage and radio frequency identity tags rfid reconceptualizing physicsedit carver mead has developed an approach he calls collective electrodynamics in which electromagnetic effects including quantized energy transfer are derived from the interactions of the wavefunctions of electrons behaving collectively in this formulation the photon is a nonentity and plancks energy–frequency relationship comes from the interactions of electron eigenstates the approach is related to john cramers transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics to the wheeler–feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics and to gilbert n lewiss early description of electromagnetic energy exchange at zero interval in spacetime this reconceptualization makes predictions that differ from general relativity for instance gravitational waves should have a different polarization under gv the name given to this new theory of gravity moreover this difference in polarization can be detected by advanced ligo companiesedit mead has been involved in the founding of at least  companies the following list indicates some of the most significant and their main contributions actel field programmable gate arrays foveon silicon sensors for photographic imaging impinj selfadaptive microchips for flash memory and rfid silicon compilers integrated circuit design sonic innovations computer

the official acm carver mead presents the universe and us an integrated theory of electromagnetics and gravitation ttivanguard carver andress mead born  may  is a us scientist and engineer he currently holds the position of gordon and betty moore professor emeritus of engineering and applied science at the california institute of technology caltech having taught there for over  years mead is an enthusiastic instructor and he advised the first female electrical engineering student at caltech louise kirkbride his contributions as a teacher include the classic textbook introduction to vlsi design  which he coauthored with lynn conway a pioneer of modern microelectronics he has made contributions to the development and design of semiconductors digital chips and silicon compilers technologies which form the foundations of modern verylargescale integration chip design in the s he focused on electronic modelling of human neurology and biology creating neuromorphic electronic systems mead has been involved in the founding of more than  companies most recently he has called for the reconceptualization of modern physics revisiting the theoretical debates of niels bohr albert einstein and others in light of later experiments and developments in instrumentation contents  early life and education  microelectronics  gaas mesfet  moores law  mead–conway vlsi design  neural models of computing  touch  hearing  vision  synapses  reconceptualizing physics  companies  awards  external links  references early life and educationedit carver andress mead was born in bakersfield california and grew up in kernville california his father worked in a power plant at the big creek hydroelectric project owned by southern california edison company carver attended a tiny local school for some years then moved to fresno california to live with his grandmother so that he could attend a larger high school he became interested in electricity and electronics while very young seeing the work at the power plant experimenting with electrical equipment qualifying for an amateur radio license and in high school working at local radio stations mead studied electrical engineering at caltech getting his bs in  his ms in  and his phd degree in  microelectronicsedit meads contributions have arisen from the application of basic physics to the development of electronic devices often in novel ways during the s he carried out systematic investigations into the energy behavior of electrons in insulators and semiconductors developing a deep understanding of electron tunneling barrier behavior and hotelectron transport in  he was the first person to describe and demonstrate a threeterminal solidstate device based on the operating principles of electron tunnelling and hotelectron transport in  he demonstrated that using tunnel emission hot electrons retained energy when traveling nanometer distances in gold his studies of iiiv compounds with w g spitzer established the importance of interface states laying the groundwork for bandgap engineering and the development of heterojunction devices gaas mesfetedit in  mead designed the first gallium arsenide gate fieldeffect transistor using a schottky barrier diode to isolate the gate from the channel as a material gaas offers much higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than silicon the gaas mesfet became the dominant microwave semiconductor device used in a variety of highfrequency wireless electronics including microwave communication systems in radio telescopes satellite dishes and cellular phones carvers work on mesfets also became the basis for the later development of hemts highelectronmobility transistors by fujitsu in  hemts like mesfets are accumulationmode devices used in microwave receivers and telecommunication systems moores lawedit mead is credited by gordon moore with coining the term moores law to denote the prediction moore made in  about the growth rate of the component count a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor fitting on a single integrated circuit moore and mead began collaborating around  when moore gave mead cosmetic reject transistors from fairchild semiconductor for his students to use in his classes during the s mead made weekly visits to fairchild visiting the research and development labs and discussing their work with moore during one of their discussions moore asked mead whether electron tunneling might limit the size of a workable transistor when told that it would he asked what the limit would be stimulated by moores question mead and his students began a physicsbased analysis of possible materials trying to determine a lower bound for moores law in  mead demonstrated contrary to common assumptions that as transistors decreased in size they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower rather he argued that transistors would get faster better cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized his results were initially met with considerable skepticism but as designers experimented more and more results supported his assertion in  mead and graduate student bruce hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as  microns this lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected despite initial doubts meads prediction influenced the computer industrys development of submicron technology when meads predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in  the transistor was highly similar to the one mead had originally described mead–conway vlsi designedit mead was the first to predict the possibility of storing millions of transistors on a chip his prediction implied that substantial changes in technology would have to occur to achieve such scalability mead was one of the first researchers to investigate techniques for verylargescale integration designing and creating highcomplexity microchips he taught the worlds first vlsi design course at caltech in  throughout the s with involvement and feedback from a succession of classes mead developed his ideas of integrated circuit and system design he worked with ivan sutherland and frederick b thompson to establish computer science as a department at caltech which formally occurred in  also in  mead coauthored a darpa report with ivan sutherland and thomas eugene everhart assessing the limitations of current microelectronics fabrication and recommending research into the system design implications of verylargescale integrated circuits beginning in  carver mead collaborated with lynn conway from xerox parc they developed the landmark text introduction to vlsi systems published in  an important spearhead of the mead  conway revolution a pioneering textbook it has been used in vlsi integrated circuit education all over the world for decades the circulation of early preprint chapters in classes and among other researchers attracted widespread interest and created a community of people interested in the approach they also demonstrated the feasibility of multiproject sharedwafer methodology creating chips for students in their classes their work caused a paradigm shift a fundamental reassessment of the development of integrated circuits and revolutionized the world of computers in  mead and conway received the award for achievement from electronics magazine in recognition of their contributions more than  years later the impact of their work is still being assessed building on the ideas of vlsi design mead and his phd student david l johannsen created the first silicon compiler capable of taking a users specifications and automatically generating an integrated circuit mead johannsen edmund k cheng and others formed silicon compilers inc sci in  sci designed one of the key chips for digital equipment corporation’s microvax minicomputer mead and conway laid the groundwork for the development of the mosis metal oxide semiconductor implementation service and the fabrication of the first cmos chip mead advocated for the idea of fabless manufacturing in which customers specify their design needs to fabless semiconductor companies the companies then design specialpurpose chips and outsource the chip fabrication to less expensive overseas semiconductor foundries neural models of computingedit next carver mead began to explore the potential for modelling biological systems of computation both animal and human brains his interest in biological models dated back at least to  when he met biophysicist max delbrück delbrück had stimulated meads interest in transducer physiology the transformations that occur between the physical input initiating a perceptual process and eventual perceptual phenomena observing graded synaptic transmission in the retina mead became interested in the potential to treat transistors as analog devices rather than digital switches he noted parallels between charges moving in mos transistors operated in weak inversion and charges flowing across the membranes of neurons he worked with professor john hopfield and nobelist richard feynman helping to create three new fields neural networks neuromorphic engineering and the physics of computation mead considered a founder of neuromorphic engineering is credited with coining the term neuromorphic processors developing this new direction mead was successful in finding venture capital funding to support the start of a number of companies in part due to an early connection with arnold beckman chairman of the caltech board of trustees mead has said that his preferred approach to development is technology push exploring something interesting and then developing useful applications for it touchedit in  mead and federico faggin founded synaptics inc to develop analog circuits based in neural networking theories suitable for use in vision and speech recognition the first product that synaptics brought to market was a pressuresensitive computer touchpad a form of sensing technology that rapidly replaced the trackball and mouse in laptop computers the synaptics touchpad was extremely successful at one point capturing  of the touchpad market hearingedit in  richard francis lyon and carver mead described the creation of an analog cochlea modelling the fluiddynamic travelingwave system of the auditory portion of the inner ear lyon had previously described a computational model for the work of the cochlea such technology had potential applications in hearing aids cochlear implants and a variety of speechrecognition devices their work has inspired ongoing research attempting to create a silicon analog that can emulate the signal processing capacities of a biological cochlea in  mead helped to form sonix technologies inc later sonic innovations inc founded by brigham young university professors doug chabries and richard christiansen in salt lake city utah mead designed the computer chip for their hearing aids in addition to being small the chip was said to be the most powerful used in a hearing aid release of the companys first product the natura hearing aid occurred in september  visionedit in the late s mead advised misha mahowald a phd student in computation and neural systems to develop the silicon retina using analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells cone cells and other nonphotoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye her  thesis received caltechs milton and francis clauser doctoral prize for its originality and potential for opening up new avenues of human thought and endeavor as of update her work was considered the best attempt to date to develop a stereoscopic vision system mead went on to describe an adaptive silicon retina using a twodimensional resistive network to model the first layer of visual processing in the outer plexiform layer of the retina around  mead and others established foveon inc in santa clara california to develop new digital camera technology based on neurallyinspired cmos image sensorprocessing chips the image sensors in the foveon x digital camera capture multiple colors for each pixel detecting red green and blue at different levels in the silicon sensor this provides more complete information and better quality photos compared to standard cameras that detect one color per pixel it has been hailed as revolutionary in  carver mead richard b merrill and richard francis lyon of foveon were awarded the progress medal of the royal photographic society for the development of the foveon x sensor synapsesedit meads work underlies the development of computer processors whose electronic components are connected in ways that resemble

of electromagnetics and gravitation ttivanguard carver andress mead born  may  is a us scientist and engineer he currently holds the position of gordon and betty moore professor emeritus of engineering and applied science at the california institute of technology caltech having taught there for over  years mead is an enthusiastic instructor and he advised the first female electrical engineering student at caltech louise kirkbride his contributions as a teacher include the classic textbook introduction to vlsi design  which he coauthored with lynn conway a pioneer of modern microelectronics he has made contributions to the development and design of semiconductors digital chips and silicon compilers technologies which form the foundations of modern verylargescale integration chip design in the s he focused on electronic modelling of human neurology and biology creating neuromorphic electronic systems mead has been involved in the founding of more than  companies most recently he has called for the reconceptualization of modern physics revisiting the theoretical debates of niels bohr albert einstein and others in light of later experiments and

reconceptualizing physics  companies  awards  external links  references early life and educationedit carver andress mead was born in bakersfield california and grew up in kernville california his father worked in a power plant at the big creek hydroelectric project owned by southern california edison company carver attended a tiny local school for some years then moved to fresno california to live with his grandmother so that he could attend a larger high school he became interested in electricity and electronics while very young seeing the work at the power plant experimenting with electrical equipment qualifying for an amateur radio license and in high school working at local radio stations mead studied electrical engineering at caltech getting his bs in  his ms in  and his phd degree in  microelectronicsedit meads contributions have arisen from the application of basic physics to the development of electronic devices often in novel ways during the s he carried out systematic investigations into the energy behavior of electrons in insulators and semiconductors developing a deep understanding of electron tunneling barrier behavior and hotelectron transport in  he was the first person to describe and demonstrate a threeterminal solidstate device based on the operating principles of electron tunnelling and hotelectron transport in  he demonstrated that using tunnel emission hot electrons retained energy when traveling nanometer distances in gold his studies of iiiv compounds with w g spitzer established the importance of interface states laying the groundwork for bandgap engineering and the development of heterojunction devices gaas mesfetedit in  mead designed the first gallium arsenide gate fieldeffect transistor using a schottky barrier diode to isolate the gate from the channel as a material gaas offers much higher electron mobility and higher saturation velocity than silicon the gaas mesfet became the dominant microwave semiconductor device used in a variety of highfrequency wireless electronics including microwave communication systems in radio telescopes satellite dishes and cellular phones carvers work on mesfets also became the basis for the later development of hemts highelectronmobility transistors by fujitsu in  hemts like mesfets are accumulationmode devices used in microwave receivers and telecommunication systems moores lawedit mead is credited by gordon moore with coining the term moores law to denote the prediction moore made in  about the growth rate of the component count a component being a transistor resistor diode or capacitor fitting on a single integrated circuit moore and mead began collaborating around  when moore gave mead cosmetic reject transistors from fairchild semiconductor for his students to use in his classes during the s mead made weekly visits to fairchild visiting the research and development labs and discussing their work with moore during one of their discussions moore asked mead whether electron tunneling might limit the size of a workable transistor when told that it would he asked what the limit would be stimulated by moores question mead and his students began a physicsbased analysis of possible materials trying to determine a lower bound for moores law in  mead demonstrated contrary to common assumptions that as transistors decreased in size they would not become more fragile or hotter or more expensive or slower rather he argued that transistors would get faster better cooler and cheaper as they were miniaturized his results were initially met with considerable skepticism but as designers experimented more and more results supported his assertion in  mead and graduate student bruce hoeneisen predicted that transistors could be made as small as  microns this lower limit to transistor size was considerably smaller than had been generally expected despite initial doubts meads prediction influenced the computer industrys development of submicron technology when meads predicted target was achieved in actual transistor development in  the transistor was highly similar to the one mead had originally described mead–conway vlsi designedit mead was the first to predict the possibility of storing millions of transistors on a chip his prediction implied that substantial changes in technology would have to occur to achieve such scalability mead was one of the first researchers to investigate techniques for verylargescale integration designing and creating highcomplexity microchips he taught the worlds first vlsi design course at caltech in  throughout the s with involvement and feedback from a succession of classes mead developed his ideas of integrated circuit and system design he worked with ivan sutherland and frederick b thompson to establish computer science as a department at caltech which formally occurred in  also in  mead coauthored a darpa report with ivan sutherland and thomas eugene everhart assessing the limitations of current microelectronics fabrication and recommending research into the system design implications of verylargescale integrated circuits beginning in  carver mead collaborated with lynn conway from xerox parc they developed the landmark text introduction to vlsi systems published in  an important spearhead of the mead  conway revolution a pioneering textbook it has been used in vlsi integrated circuit education all over the world for decades the circulation of early preprint chapters in classes and among other researchers attracted widespread interest and created a community of people interested in the approach they also demonstrated the feasibility of multiproject sharedwafer methodology creating chips for students in their classes their work caused a paradigm shift a fundamental reassessment of the development of integrated circuits and revolutionized the world of computers in  mead and conway received the award for achievement from electronics magazine in recognition of their contributions more than  years later the impact of their work is still being assessed building on the ideas of vlsi design mead and his phd student david l johannsen created the first silicon compiler capable of taking a users specifications and automatically generating an integrated circuit mead johannsen edmund k cheng and others formed silicon compilers inc sci in  sci designed one of the key chips for digital equipment corporation’s microvax minicomputer mead and conway laid the groundwork for the development of the mosis metal oxide semiconductor implementation service and the fabrication of the first cmos chip mead advocated for the idea of fabless manufacturing in which customers specify their design needs to fabless semiconductor companies the companies then design specialpurpose chips and outsource the chip fabrication to less expensive overseas semiconductor foundries neural models of computingedit next carver mead began to explore the potential for modelling biological systems of computation both animal and human brains his interest in biological models dated back at least to  when he met biophysicist max delbrück delbrück had stimulated meads interest in transducer physiology the transformations that occur between the physical input initiating a perceptual process and eventual perceptual phenomena observing graded synaptic transmission in the retina mead became interested in the potential to treat transistors as analog devices rather than digital switches he noted parallels between charges moving in mos transistors operated in weak inversion and charges flowing across the membranes of neurons he worked with professor john hopfield and nobelist richard feynman helping to create three new fields neural networks neuromorphic engineering and the physics of computation mead considered a founder of neuromorphic engineering is credited with coining the term neuromorphic processors developing this new direction mead was successful in finding venture capital funding to support the start of a number of companies in part due to an early connection with arnold beckman chairman of the caltech board of trustees mead has said that his preferred approach to development is technology push exploring something interesting and then developing useful applications for it touchedit in  mead and federico faggin founded synaptics inc to develop analog circuits based in neural networking theories suitable for use in vision and speech recognition the first product that synaptics brought to market was a pressuresensitive computer touchpad a form of sensing technology that rapidly replaced the trackball and mouse in laptop computers the synaptics touchpad was extremely successful at one point capturing  of the touchpad market hearingedit in  richard francis lyon and carver mead described the creation of an analog cochlea modelling the fluiddynamic travelingwave system of the auditory portion of the inner ear lyon had previously described a computational model for the work of the cochlea such technology had potential applications in hearing aids cochlear implants and a variety of speechrecognition devices their work has inspired ongoing research attempting to create a silicon analog that can emulate the signal processing capacities of a biological cochlea in  mead helped to form sonix technologies inc later sonic innovations inc founded by brigham young university professors doug chabries and richard christiansen in salt lake city utah mead designed the computer chip for their hearing aids in addition to being small the chip was said to be the most powerful used in a hearing aid release of the companys first product the natura hearing aid occurred in september  visionedit in the late s mead advised misha mahowald a phd student in computation and neural systems to develop the silicon retina using analog electrical circuits to mimic the biological functions of rod cells cone cells and other nonphotoreceptive cells in the retina of the eye her  thesis received caltechs milton and francis clauser doctoral prize for its originality and potential for opening up new avenues of human thought and endeavor as of update her work was considered the best attempt to date to develop a stereoscopic vision system mead went on to describe an adaptive silicon retina using a twodimensional resistive network to model the first layer of visual processing in the outer plexiform layer of the retina around  mead and others established foveon inc in santa clara california to develop new digital camera technology based on neurallyinspired cmos image sensorprocessing chips the image sensors in the foveon x digital camera capture multiple colors for each pixel detecting red green and blue at different levels in the silicon sensor this provides more complete information and better quality photos compared to standard cameras that detect one color per pixel it has been hailed as revolutionary in  carver mead richard b merrill and richard francis lyon of foveon were awarded the progress medal of the royal photographic society for the development of the foveon x sensor synapsesedit meads work underlies the development of computer processors whose electronic components are connected in ways that resemble biological synapses in  and  mead hasler diorio and minch presented single transistor silicon synapses capable of analog learning applications and longterm memory storage carver pioneered the use of floatinggate transistors as a means of nonvolatile storage for neuromorphic and other analog circuits mead and diorio went on to found impinj based on their work with floatinggate transistors using lowpower methods of storing charges on floatinggate transistors impinj developed applications for flash memory storage and radio frequency identity tags rfid reconceptualizing physicsedit carver mead has developed an approach he calls collective electrodynamics in which electromagnetic effects including quantized energy transfer are derived from the interactions of the wavefunctions of electrons behaving collectively in this formulation the photon is a nonentity and plancks energy–frequency relationship comes from the interactions of electron eigenstates the approach is related to john cramers transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics to the wheeler–feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics and to gilbert n lewiss early description of electromagnetic energy exchange at zero interval in spacetime this reconceptualization makes predictions that differ from general relativity for instance gravitational waves should have a different polarization under gv the name given to this new theory of gravity moreover this difference in polarization can be detected by advanced ligo companiesedit mead has been involved in the founding of at least  companies the following list indicates some of the most significant and their main contributions actel field programmable gate arrays foveon silicon sensors for photographic imaging impinj selfadaptive microchips for flash memory and rfid silicon compilers integrated circuit design sonic innovations computer
