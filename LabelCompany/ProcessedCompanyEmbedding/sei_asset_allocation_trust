expansion alongside this expansion equity markets have rallied and after a long period of being undervalued appear to be near fair value even as the us economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion economies across the world are still struggling to find growth moderating output on a global level and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed as a consequence we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets while returns may be lower and more volatile than expected inflation is also lower leaving afterinflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns given this background of tepid global economic growth unconventional monetary policy measures and near fair market valuation we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of  and beyond  checking up on your portfolio in terms of overall portfolio weightings as of this writing we have largely moved to neutral in equities we maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity we also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises further we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach typically associated with a buyandhold strategy clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio through the second half and later generally you concentrate to create wealth you diversify to maintain wealth  review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant and equally important review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future   take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value  evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position if not consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position generally you concentrate to create wealth you diversify to maintain wealth  consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve for some time now passive funds such as exchangetraded funds or etfs have been popular with investors interasset class correlations having been elevated are now declining relative to historical averages meaning passive investing may become less effective this coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios  when investing for yield be aware that many yieldgenerating investments — including longdated bonds treasury and agency securities and certain real estate investment trusts reits — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates we encourage investors to think about a broader totalreturn approach with a focus on appreciation potential depreciation risk and yield  manage portfolios for tax efficiency as we often say “it’s not what you make it’s what you keep” with top effective federal marginal rates at over  — net of certain phaseouts and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — taxefficient investing and taxloss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer minimize and offset income tax liabilities therefore consider the following think about placing taxinefficient asset classes and strategies in taxadvantaged accounts evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as etfs master limited partnerships reits common stocks and qualified preferred stocks as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year remember taxadvantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic taxlossharvesting opportunities and potentially better aftertax returns with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting throughout the year  use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs a diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends bond coupons and other income flows which can be augmented by rulesbased rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals considering nonprofits many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations npos as well in addition npos should review spending rates and smoothing formulas particularly when they need consistency in spending they should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs andor meet operating needs for more information contact your us trust

expansion alongside this expansion equity markets have rallied and after a long period of being undervalued appear to be near fair value even as the us economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion economies across the world are still struggling to find growth moderating output on a global level and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed as a consequence we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets while returns may be lower and more volatile than expected inflation is also lower leaving afterinflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns given this background of tepid global economic growth unconventional monetary policy measures and near fair market valuation we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of  and beyond  checking up on your portfolio in terms of overall portfolio weightings as of this writing we have largely moved to neutral in equities we maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity we also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises further we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach typically associated with a buyandhold strategy clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio through the second half and later generally you concentrate to create wealth you diversify to maintain wealth  review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant and equally important review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future   take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value  evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position if not consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position generally you concentrate to create wealth you diversify to maintain wealth  consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve for some time now passive funds such as exchangetraded funds or etfs have been popular with investors interasset class correlations having been elevated are now declining relative to historical averages meaning passive investing may become less effective this coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios  when investing for yield be aware that many yieldgenerating investments — including longdated bonds treasury and agency securities and certain real estate investment trusts reits — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates we encourage investors to think about a broader totalreturn approach with a focus on appreciation potential depreciation risk and yield  manage portfolios for tax efficiency as we often say “it’s not what you make it’s what you keep” with top effective federal marginal rates at over  — net of certain phaseouts and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — taxefficient investing and taxloss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer minimize and offset income tax liabilities therefore consider the following think about placing taxinefficient asset classes and strategies in taxadvantaged accounts evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as etfs master limited partnerships reits common stocks and qualified preferred stocks as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year remember taxadvantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic taxlossharvesting opportunities and potentially better aftertax returns with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting throughout the year  use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs a diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends bond coupons and other income flows which can be augmented by rulesbased rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals considering nonprofits many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations npos as well in addition npos should review spending rates and smoothing formulas particularly when they need consistency in spending they should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs andor meet operating needs for more information contact your us trust

associated with future political and economic developments investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in more developed countries in addition concentration of investments in a single region may result in greater volatility alternative investments alternative investments are intended for qualified and suitable investors only alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk real estate investment trusts reits reits involve a significant degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative they are only made available to qualified investors under the terms of a private offering memorandum holdings in a reit may be highly leveraged and therefore more sensitive to adverse business or financial developments reits are long term and unlikely to produce a realized return for investors for a number of years investments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties the effect of economic conditions on real estate values changes in interest rates and risks related to renting properties such as rental defaults we believe the united states economy is in the midcycle phase of a long economic expansion alongside this expansion equity markets have rallied and after a long period of being undervalued appear to be near fair value even as the us economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion economies across the world are still struggling to find growth moderating output on a global level and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed as a consequence we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets while returns may be lower and more volatile than expected inflation is also lower leaving afterinflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns given this background of tepid global economic growth unconventional monetary policy measures and near fair market valuation we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of  and beyond  checking up on your portfolio in terms of overall portfolio weightings as of this writing we have largely moved to neutral in equities we maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity we also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises further we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach typically associated with a buyandhold strategy clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio through the second half and later generally you concentrate to create wealth you diversify to maintain wealth  review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant and equally important review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future   take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value  evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position if not consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position generally you concentrate to create wealth you diversify to maintain wealth  consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve for some time now passive funds such as exchangetraded funds or etfs have been popular with investors interasset class correlations having been elevated are now declining relative to historical averages meaning passive investing may become less effective this coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios  when investing for yield be aware that many yieldgenerating investments — including longdated bonds treasury and agency securities and certain real estate investment trusts reits — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates we encourage investors to think about a broader totalreturn approach with a focus on appreciation potential depreciation risk and yield  manage portfolios for tax efficiency as we often say “it’s not what you make it’s what you keep” with top effective federal marginal rates at over  — net of certain phaseouts and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — taxefficient investing and taxloss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer minimize and offset income tax liabilities therefore consider the following think about placing taxinefficient asset classes and strategies in taxadvantaged accounts evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as etfs master limited partnerships reits common stocks and qualified preferred stocks as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year remember taxadvantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic taxlossharvesting opportunities and potentially better aftertax returns with periods of episodic volatility think about taxloss harvesting throughout the year  use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs a diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends bond coupons and other income flows which can be augmented by rulesbased rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals considering nonprofits many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations npos as well in addition npos should review spending rates and smoothing formulas particularly when they need consistency in spending they should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs andor meet operating needs for more information contact your us trust advisor photograph of stones by dimitri otisgetty images important information investing involves risk there is
