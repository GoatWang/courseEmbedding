traded company knowles corp the next few months promise to be rocky blame it on the smartphone industrys disappointing duo nokia and blackberry knowles maker of miniature speakers and receivers was spun off this month from its conglomerate parent dover corp the itascabased company enjoyed a sixfold burst in revenue between  and  to  billion but the company already is warning that firstquarter revenue will slide  to  percent from a year ago with sales in its key mobile consumer electronics segment decreasing as much as  percent operating profit is projected to fall  to  percent as a result the stock has moved but a little from its debut at  on march  to  on march  “we face some headwinds early this year” acknowledges jeffrey niew  knowles president and ceo “but we think those headwinds will shift behind us after the third quarter” knowles which dates back almost  years has been the worlds no  maker of transistorbased microphones—the first words spoken by astronaut neil armstrong on the moon  years ago were broadcast through a knowles microphone in his helmet more recently it prospered by supplying tiny audio components to mobile phone giants nokia corp and blackberry ltd previously known as research in motion ltd as well as makers of hearing aids and other electronic gadgets the ups and downs of consumer electronics may be why it was cut loose by dover a downers grovebased manufacturing conglomerate better known for its staid portfolio of refrigeration and foodservice products and printing “dover is a hardcore industrial company aimed at investors who favor value stocks” says harsh kumar a memphis tennbased analyst at financial services firm stephens inc “meanwhile knowles is an electronics company with a much growthier outlook it was not a very good match to its parent company” dover executives decline to comment knowles is struggling because its big customers are struggling in the past year both finlands nokia and blackberry which is based outside toronto have ceded market share to smartphone leaders samsung electronics co of south korea and cupertino califbased apple inc those two source their smartphones in asia where rivals to knowles have taken chunks of business away the bestknown is aac technologies holdings inc of shenzhen china with nearly  billion in sales last year and luxurious  percent gross profit margins compared with knowles  percentat one point we had  percent of the market” mr niew says “we always knew that secondary sources would be coming along but our share is still between  and  percent” the company is catching on with the other smartphone makers fast analysts say knowles advantage is reputed to be the best research and development work in the industry and a keen eye for costcutting the company is moving its hearingaid production from china to the philippines this year after its member chinese workforce won minimum wages of  an hour up from  cents an hour when knowles arrived in  “our labor costs will be halved in the philippines” estimates mr niew who is closing plants on other fronts to consolidate production in fewer places debt protection knowles founded by acoustical engineer hugh knowles in  was the first maker of transistorbased microphones he died in  at age  and about a decade later the family sold the business to an investment group headed by english firm doughty hanson  co dover bought knowles in  for  million mr niew formerly the chief operating officer took the ceo title a year ago dover stuck knowles with some  million in debt in the spinoff but mr kumar is unconcerned “their interest payments currently are running  million a year and the company is generating  million a year in free cash flow so theyve got adequate protection on the debt side” he says earnings will be down slightly in the first half of the year he says but a big fourth quarter should propel the company to fullyear profits of  million or  a share up from  million or  a share in  both mr kumar and jmp securities in san francisco rate the stock a “buy” with a price target of  nicholas heymann an analyst at william blair  co in chicago expects dover which invested heavily in knowles recently to trade up after the spinoff “dover is finding success in getting rid of noncore businesses” he says as for knowles he expects bumpy profits as it reshuffles customers in the volatile consumer electronics field “owning that stock will be like riding a bucking bronco” mr heymann says “knowles theoretically should enjoy more growth than dover but dovers growth is much more predictable and homogenous across its portfolio” apple inc dover corp knowles corp manufacturing telecom todays crains get our daily roundup of important business news read next heres how four loko
