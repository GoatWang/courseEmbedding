carols daughter founder on success and crossing the racial hair care divide by janell ross lisa price knew that something big had happened to her company when she walked into a new york macys store in  price went in incognito hoping to get the average consumer experience at the counter where shoppers buy her carols daughter brand lotions and creams hair oils butters and scents she said price was expecting a few floor displays then she saw the words carols daughter attached to a wall i thought these people must really be serious price said somebody has put actual holes in the wall it was an amazing moment for price in the early s she was part of a television production team by day and by night she was a onewoman productconcocting hobbyistturnedentrepreneur actually in prices case it was more like nights and weekends in  prices mother carol convinced her to bring some of her handmade concoctions to a church flea market price spent about  to cover the fees labels and a  lace tablecloth to make her display look a little more homey she said the church flea market and several similar events garnered price a small following then a cadre of customers started visiting prices brooklyn apartment for holiday shopping events and populated the pages of prices customer contact list being the s price was collecting postal addresses not email accounts and she kept her recipes in an ordinary notebook in the early years the company sold about  to  in products the brand soon expanded from lotions to hair oils butters conditioners and other products then price added a catalogue a retail store in brooklyn and then online sales in  the company was featured on the oprah winfrey show the daytime tv host and beauty product rainmaker declared herself a fan of the brands foot lotion from there sales skyrocketed the line that price had once managed in her spare time from a spare bedroom reached  million in sales but then growth started to slow i knew no bank was going to say to someone who was operating a business in her house in brooklyn oh heres  million lets make some butter said price price pulled together the money to purchase a commercial building and began gradually moving out the shipping manufacturing and other functions from her kitchen and spare bedroom but there was still the lingering question of getting the capital needed to really rev up marketing and sales price had been approached before by companies that made her feel like she needed to dance or to audition for the level of investment that would allow the company to develop new products and reach new consumers in  a friend suggested that she meet with steve stoute a onetime music industry executive and now ceo of translation a marketing and ad company stoute listened then he told price that it seemed the only thing standing in the way of becoming a fullfledged prestige beauty brand was the ability to write a check and move the project forward i really knew that i had done everything that i could on my own i mean i had gotten on oprah without having a pr agent said price but i really did have to give it a lot of thought after some additional conversations stoute brought together a celebrity investment team that includes will smith his wife jada pinket smith and jayz the group invested about  million in carols daughter in exchange price surrendered an ownership stake in the company that she declined to specify that was the decision that changed everything price said i honestly had not thought of carols daughter as a beauty company in  sephora a beauty products store began selling carols daughter products today the companys products are among the topselling items on the home shopping network and in the sephora sections of jc penney and dillards department stores sales this year are expected to top  million the typical carols daughter client is a yearold or older africanamerican woman the company would like its average customers age to trend into the s as the company grows price wants to continue to minimize the number of synthetic ingredients in its products and she wants the company to become known for serving a variety of womens beauty needs the world is becoming a much more multiracial place and perpetuating the idea that carols daughter is a brand for black women with natural hair alone can be limiting price said to help shift the companys image the company has unveiled a new ad campaign featuring three celebrity spokesmodels at least two of whom have relatively recent multiracial ancestry the move has garnered some criticism one blogger wrote that he was disappointed to see a blackowned company reinforcing a whiter or at least biracial standard of beauty we want to expand said price and we do want to reach new customers because there are a lot of people who do not always identify themselves or the products they buy by race thats why we are trying to talk to our customers in terms of skin types and conditions hair textures and types but we want to do that without alienating our core customer we extremely grateful for every one of them suggest a correction janell ross reporter  politics business latino voices black voices
