halloysite nanotubes a bundle of naturalnano halloysite nanotubes compared to the width of a human hair halloysite nanotubes imaged at cornell university halloysite nanotubes imaged at alfred university with a transmission electron microscope halloysite nanotubes naturally formed in the earth over millions of years halloysite nanotubes are unique and versatile nanomaterials that are formed by surface weathering of aluminosilicate minerals and are composed of aluminum silicon hydrogen and oxygen halloysite nanotubes are ultratiny hollow tubes with diameters typically smaller than  nanometers  billionths of a meter with lengths typically ranging from about  nanometers to over  microns millionths of a meter our team of scientists and researchers are developing methods of separating out the nanotubes and processing them for use in numerous commercial applications such as additives in polymers and plastics electronic components cosmetics and home and personal care products properties of halloysite nanotubes the elements are aluminum silicon hydrogen oxygen the functional characteristics desired for specific applications can be controlled through selection of nanotube diameter and length diameters typically range from about nm to nm and in a variety of lengths allowing for a wide range of applications halloysite nanotubes can be coated with metallic and other substances to achieve a wide variety of electrical chemical and physical properties they can be filled with such things as active ingredients including many that are used for cosmetics household and personal care products pesticides pest repellents pharmaceuticals and other agents that could benefit from extended release naturalnano has identified additional applications not yet publicly disclosed for these unique and abundantly available materials the separation challenge while halloysite nanotubes are found in large quantity in the earth the process of mining and separating them is technically challenging naturalnano scientists and engineers are developing patentpending proprietary processes for extracting separating and classifying specific types of halloysite nanotubes from

today’s nanocomposite materials today most nanocomposites used in the plastics industry are made with “platy nanoclay” materials but these clays are very difficult and expensive to process platy clays such as the kaolin clay below contain layered twodimensional sheets held together by an intercalation or intermediary layer the sheets must first be exfoliated or chemically separated so they can function as nanoparticulate fillers and be dispersed in the polymer matrix in today’s platy nanoclay production process these multiple steps lead to complexity cost and dispersion quality challenges in addition most manufacturers do not have the specialized equipment needed to produce composites with platy nanoclays – this required investment is the biggest market barrier for nanoclays pleximer advantage naturalnano’s patent product bypasses these multiple processing steps and complex chemistry by offering the manufacturer a turnkey dropin solution that runs on standard conventional equipment pleximer is a turnkey concentrate in the form of pellets that can be added directly into the extruder by the end manufacturer pleximer contains halloysite clay nanotubes shown below that are blended with a specific polymer base utilizing naturalnano’s patent technology the resulting product is a dropin additive pleximer doesn’t require the expensive exfoliation process needed by platy clay systems and it successfully provides the required dispersion in a polymer matrix platy nanoclays by comparison have trouble achieving uniform dispersion even with exfoliation and work with a limited number of polymer families the nanocomposite market is also limited by the small number of manufacturers that have invested in the knowhow and the specialized equipment necessary to run platy nanoclays naturalnano believes that the pleximer technology will have rapid industry acceptance because it enables manufacturers to produce nanocomposites with existing equipment naturalnano is currently focused on leveraging this new dropin turnkey advantage to a select number of industrial compounders who supply major industries such as automotive performance sporting goods and aerospace
