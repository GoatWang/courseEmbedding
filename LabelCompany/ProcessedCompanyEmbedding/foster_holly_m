foster hollies and had to have one they were at least  tall covered with red berries and shaped like a christmas tree not knowing anything about plants we picked what looked like a healthy plant brought back to dallas tx and planted years later its still alive never produced any berries and today is only  tall ive finally did some research and learned several things although not positive of our specific variety i think it needs a opposite gender to pollinate for berries i also planted directly from the pot so no telling if it suffers from girdled roots i think ive watered correctly soil samples sent to texas a  m confim a  ph level so i tried to ammend with peat moss read more general purpose fertilizers and soil acidifier ive only recently covered the drip line area with mulch despite my best efforts to kill the plant it still stays a beautiful green throughout the year i sit here writing trying to figure out how to determine its gender and buy its mate to produce berries i found one site where examining its leaves can determine malefemale i have no place to put another plant so i am considering growing one from a pot i buried my father in dyserburg tenn thats why i was there my first sighting of the hollies were at the funeral home so the plant means a lot to me any info i find may help the plant thrive ive found additional info through research i found that foster  and  are not common the  is a male it has stamens coming from the flower whereas the female has a green berry in the flower center ive gone to a local dallas tx nursery and found a  it had a few berries and planted within  of the male unfortunately internet information can conflict i found that a  can produce berries this being midnovember i await flower production to really know what i have

everyone for the holiday season the only holly that produces berries on just one plant dense and healthy evergreen foliage beautiful specimen tree screen or hedge easily grown in sun or partialshade

garden and it is hardy and reliable throughout all but the coldest parts of the country plant hardiness zones  mature height  ft mature width  ft sunlight full sun to partial shade soil conditions average welldrained drought tolerance moderate botanical name foster holly ilex x attenuata fosteri holly is a popular evergreen shrub for hedges and specimen plants but its main attraction has to be the red berries that are such a traditional part of christmas celebrations so a lot of people buy a holly tree – but then never see any berries – a big disappointment this is because holly trees are separate male and female trees and most female trees will not produce berries without a male around this means planting another tree – if of course you have enough room – just to get berries on your first tree and the male tree will then never produce berries allinall this is a bit of a nuisance especially if you have a small garden so at the tree center we decided to solve this problem for our customers we talked to growers and experts and we found the foster holly foster holly is a hybrid female holly tree that produces a bumper crop of brightred berries just in time for christmas but this tree will do it all by herself without needing a male tree at all this is very unusual among hollies but it makes the foster holly the perfect holly for every garden especially if you don’t have room for more than one holly tree this vigorous small tree will grow  to  feet tall and  to  feet wide if left untrimmed it makes a great specimen in an open area or a background plant filling a corner of your garden behind other bushes since it is evergreen it also makes an excellent screening plant as a row along the edge of your property since it can easily be trimmed it is also a perfect choice for a hedge especially since it will grown in partial shade and in full sun foster holly has evergreen leaves that are  to  inches long with an irregular margin and several sharp tiny spines on the leaf these are not much of a problem but they do mean that a wellclipped holly hedge is very unpleasant to push through and will deter most humans and animals from coming into your garden the leaves are glossy a rich olivegreen in color and look attractive all year round the tree usually grows with a single trunk and branches radiating off it unless of course it has been pruned back in which case it will develop multiple stems and a bushier appearance this makes the foster holly very versatile since it can be shaped to fit the purpose you have in mind in spring small white flowers will appear on your tree to be followed by a heavy crop of brightred berries which are produced without the need for a male tree to pollinate it the berries will ripen before christmas just in time to decorate your home for the holiday season and they will also stay colorful and attractive on the tree all winter they are not edible but birds will often eat them plant your foster holly in a sunny or partiallyshaded location it will grow in damp soil as well as ordinary garden soil but once established it is also droughtresistant so this is a great lowmaintenance garden plant it has no significant pests or diseases and is vigorous with a good growthrate it is hardy to minus  degrees fahrenheit so it can be grown in most of the country from ohio to kansas and south as well as all through the west the foster holly is a hybrid between two american species of wild holly one is the american holly ilex opaca which grows wild in eastern and central states the other species is the dahoon ilex cassine which grows further south from virginia to texas and even in cuba in the s e e foster who owned foster nursery in bessemer alabama crossed these two plants and raised five seedlings when these grew into fullsized plants it turned out that the plant he had called  was the best since it was a female tree that produced a heavy crop of berries without a male tree being needed since then this tree has been grown and tested in many gardens and is probably the best holly available to grow as a single tree as you can imagine these plants must be carefully raised from stem cuttings taken from trees guaranteed to be the correct variety so other cheaper holly bushes will not be the foster holly and will only be a disappointment never producing berries for you from a single plant to plant a screen of foster holly space your trees  to  feet apart depending on how quickly you want the screen to fill in for a hedge space the plants  feet apart and lightly clip from the first year as your hedge grows to develop a dense structure always keep the top of your hedge narrower than the bottom so that you keep leaves growing right to the ground trim in late winter before flowering to get the maximum crop of berries and trim again in late summer if necessary at the tree center we strive to give our customers the best and with the foster holly tree we really feel this is the best holly you can buy plants of this quality are always in high demand and our stocks are limited so order a single specimen or several to make a beautiful hedge or screen you will not be disappointed but order now
