nashville coal advised tampa electric that the contract was illegal under the antitrust laws would therefore not be performed and no coal would be delivered tampa electric was therefore obliged to

annual consumption of peninsular florida  tons emphasizing that fact as well as the contract value of the coal covered by the year term— million—they held that such volume was not insignificant or

been foreclosed in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected in practical application even though a contract is found to be an exclusive dealing arrangement it does not violate the section unless the court believes it probable that performance of the contract will foreclose competition in a substantial share of the line of commerce affected the court then directly quoted standard stations a purely quantitative measure of this effect is inadequate because the narrower the area of competition the greater the comparative effect on the areas competitors since it is the preservation of competition which is at stake the significant proportion of coverage is that within the area of effective competition that meant the court said that it was necessary to evaluate this contract in terms of its magnitude in the relevant market the competition foreclosed by the contract must be found to constitute a substantial share of the relevant market that is to say the

in the setting of the large number of gasoline stations— or  of the retail outlets in the relevant market—and the large number of contracts over  together with the great volume of products involved
