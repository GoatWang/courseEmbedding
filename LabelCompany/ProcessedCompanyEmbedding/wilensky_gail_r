national health policy forum home about the forum products resources sponsors contact us pbs healthcare crisis gail r wilensky phd what are some of the dangers were facing now gail r wilensky phd john m olin senior fellow project hope chair medicare payment advisory commission its pretty clear right now that the problems that were facing are not going to correct themselves the fact that weve seen the number of people who are without insurance grow in part reflects the problem we have relying on employersponsored insurance in an era when that may not make much sense for at least all of the under  population we have an aging population seventyeight million baby boomers are going to start to retire at the end of this decade thatll put enormous stresses on the pension and medicare system we need to think about what makes sense for the st century whether or not its what made sense for the th century and we keep having advances in medical technology and ways to keep people alive longer so that raises a whole set of questions that we havent dealt with are there opportunities inside this crisis there are peculiarities in how we have insurance coverage today that we probably wouldnt duplicate it may be possible that we can evolve into a more sensible strategy over time its important to have an idea about where you want to go what you would like health care financing delivery to look like its just how you get there and whether you attempt to displace or destroy what you have now which works pretty well for large numbers of the population thats something were not inclined to do as opposed to making gradual steps and improvements to try to get to a better type of delivery system do ethics play or should they play a role in health care policy ethics will always play some role for the individuals who are involved ethical decisions get raised in hospitals on a daily basis in the life and death decisions that are involved between the physician and a patient the real question that people frequently mean is should ethical issues be a part of national health policy its a hard question to answer but i believe they really wont be in the sense in which people generally use the term and i think that because we are a very different heterogeneous population very different background ethnically religiously racially very different views about the appropriateness and efficacy of medicine and i think it would be very difficult for us to have a single uniform policy with regard to rationing of health care that is limiting on an official policy health care that the medical system thought was beneficial i dont see that we would be able the do it talk about your ideas on government assistance when i look at the issue of social obligation or a sense of responsibility it seems to me we are clearer for some populations i believe most people would agree that the poor and there are a lot of discussions about exactly who you put into that category will need some or a lot of help in terms of financing their own health care when it starts becoming more difficult is as people rise up the income scale should they be paying for their own health insurance coverage or do they need some subsidy some help and should there be the same amount of assistance no matter how wealthy or how poor those individuals are for my own values i wish we would start with the lowest income it seems to me that is an area in which there is widespread agreement and one of the great frustrations i have is in the  period both republicans and democrats included legislative proposals that at least included everybody below the poverty line and frequently substantial subsidies for people up to  percent of the poverty line and yet there wasnt a willingness to say even if we should do more lets at least make sure we do this because it had been as far as i can remember the first time that both political parties were on record as saying there should be a minimum benefit package for at least the very poorest to my mind it was just shameful that we let that period slip away these opportunities come along we ought to take advantage of them make progress and then come back to the table why is maintaining the status quo bad there are some problems we can see right now mostly for the individuals some stresses and pressures for the provider community but they seem to generally be able to take care of themselves pretty well as we can see from this last giveback of  billion in refinements to the balanced budget act but there are some individuals who are clearly at risk whether or not it will be an issue will depend on what else happens where they live whether they actually get a major illness people without insurance coverage are at risk they may only have routine expenses and if theyre not poor or very poor they should be able to take care of routine expenses even if theyre middle or upper middle class if they start having a serious medical illness that can present some real financial problems so those individuals are at risk and some number of them will have real problems the aging of the populations going to have a lot of repercussions we have this bulge in the age distribution of the population the people who were born between  and  who are aging and beginning to edge near retirement and we need to think about how to sensibly pay for the pension and health care needs of an older population i think its going to cause us to rethink whether or not were serious about social insurance talk about medicare there are a number of problems with medicare let me say first as somebody whos formerly director of medicare its a very popular social program and it has accomplished the major objective that it was set out to accomplish which was to make sure that seniors had access to medical care so when i criticize it its almost in a friendly benighted way rather than as a major criticism but its a peculiar program because it doesnt provide any catastrophic protection thats a very odd insurance program it doesnt now cover what we regard as part of mainstream coverage that is outpatient prescription drugs and even more importantly the level of coverage is not enough for the poorest and probably more than needs to be for the wealthiest among the seniors i dont see us willing to publicly finance a program that covers for all seniors what the poorest seniors need i dont want to turn it into a welfare program i think there are good arguments for losing the support of mainstream population if you make it into a welfare program but i think you can have a sliding contribution that the government makes as peoples incomes increase we do it all the time in the tax system so this is not a new concept  we pay twice as much for healthcare as any other country why there are lots of reasons were an inpatient population were very keen on new technology and procedures and we dont have to want to wait for them or have to travel long distances i think we will always spend substantially more relative to our gross national product than other countries and as a wealthy industrialized country there isnt any reason why we ought not to allow ourselves to do that the question that we ought to ask is whether or not we think were getting our moneys worth do we have good incentives built into the decisionmaking about spending on health care i think thats the much more important much of what we buy in health care has very little to do with life and death at the moment it has a lot to do with convenience information assurance for the worried well or the worried sick and a lot about quality of life where do you see this going in five to ten years i think we are going to actively struggle early on with the issues of the uninsured and the role of employersponsored insurance in the st century it is going to be very difficult to avoid this even in our prosperous economy we see the number growing if we at some point have a slowdown in the economy let alone anything as serious as a recession those numbers are likely to jump up in a substantial way we have to think about what makes sense for people who arent offered employersponsored insurance because theyre parttime workers or fulltime entrepreneurs what is the appropriate responsibility and obligation of the individual do we want to try to encourage employers to offer insurance who now tend not to such as small employers low wage employers or is it something that we want to try to make available to individuals through some mechanism what are we going to do for people who are primarily low income are we going to continue what weve started with the childrens health insurance program that is part of the states programs are we going to let some people go without insurance coverage if they choose to go without insurance coverage do we need something for catastrophic care available i think were going to start once again to look at these issues we did it in  i just hope were a little more honest with ourselves about what we really are willing to pay for and for whom were in the most prosperous time in the nations history and yet the number of uninsured has doubled in the last ten years in this country well the issue of doing away with a mechanism that provides health insurance to large numbers of the under ought to be approached very gingerly i dont know very many people who would today advocate starting an employerbased insurance system economists such as myself believe that the employer contribution is just part of the compensation package which would otherwise go to the employee so its really the employees money that the employer is spending they do so because of tax provisions that encourage part of the compensation to be provided as this kind of fringe benefit it tends to have the employee think its free and not care about what happens the question about why the numbers of uninsured have increased during this time of prosperity also need to be thought about in terms of the income groups that are affected there are some individuals who are transitioning off welfare who are not on medicaid now and going into jobs that do not provide insurance coverage as part of their job now some of these individuals actually could continue to be on medicaid but for a variety of reasons have chosen not to do that for some other individuals were beginning to see something that had not been present in the  or  years before its not a large number although it might be as many as  percent of the working uninsured of people who were offered insurance employersponsored coverage and said thanks but no thanks presumably their contribution was larger than they were able or willing to spend in terms of buying insurance coverage one of the lessons that i really learned when i was running medicare and medicaid is the different attitude toward government that exists around the country i grew up in the midwest and i have spent much of my adult life in washington and in the northeast and in both those places people tend to not be quite as mistrustful of the government as they are in other parts of the country when i would go out to places like wyoming or montana or south dakota i was really surprised to find out for many of the individuals in the provider communities how much they basically thought the problem was the federal government and that if i would get out of their way they could resolve their problems on their own thank you its not a question of whether thats right or wrong its important to remember that we are a very big and diverse country with very different attitudes toward social responsibility and government responsibility and the appropriateness of government in various spheres of our life and if we ignore that when were trying to resolve these very difficult social issues the chances are they arent going to get resolved the president of humana stated back in the s that he wanted to have health care as consistent as a mcdonalds hamburger there are a lot of issues that we need to deal with making sure that good outcomes are the expectation and the result lowering medical errors reducing complications because of inappropriate use of pharmaceuticals or drug interactions is very important i dont know that most people would necessarily feel comfortable with the notion of the mcdonald analogy to health care but the idea that you ought to feel pretty comfortable that you will have a good product or service reliably provided each and every time you go is not a bad goal for health care are things in health care better now than they were  years ago i think things are much better in many dimensions now than they were  years ago our romanticizing marcus welby ignored the fact that house calls made sense when there wasnt very much you could do anyway and so allowing people to stay in the comfort of their houses made a lot of sense when you have somebody whos really sick now you want them in an emergency room environment or an intensive care environment where there are many things that can really make a difference that youre not likely to be able to pick and carry with you into someones home but we have some problems i think we would do well not to always flagellate ourselves with our problems and remember some of our successes but to get serious about what were willing to do to resolve some of the problems with regard to the uninsured especially the poorest uninsured lets start with them first think about what we want to do with the aging baby boomer population and then worry about longterm care and if i had my druthers id do it in that order bruce vladeck said that if youre rich you get healthcare if youre poor you dont what do you think about the twotiered system approach i think if youre rich you get care some of its very good some of it probably isnt but you get a lot of it i believe if youre poor you are usually able to get a fair amount of care a lot of care in some cases some of which is very good some of which is not some of the lower middle class probably are at the most risk they may not have insurance or their insurance may not be as complete and theyre not easily eligible for assistance thats probably our biggest problem the lowermiddle income working uninsured population or maybe even underinsured population vladeck also described the medicare industrial complex can you comment on the trillionbillion of health care in this country  billion being spent on medicare and the provider community wonders why the government is bothering them its a lot of money much of it is well spent some of it is not it is reasonable and appropriate to go after fraud and abuse its a very complicated program enormous amount of regulations it frustrates a lot of people one of the concerns i have had is even when run by wellmeaning hardworking people is it really possible to have the federal government decide on the appropriate price for each unit of service and whether the quality with which it occurred was appropriate this goes to the issue about what we want medicare for the st century to look like but being vigilant about making sure that what the government is funding is really provided and was needed and was provided at an acceptable quality level is an appropriate role for government even if it irritates some of the people on the other side to the extent that the health care system makes it possible should the child of a gas station at attendant have the same chance of dying of particular illness as a child of a corporation executive it may depend a little bit on what the risk is being caused by and let me share that with you we ought to be making sure that people particularly the lowest income among us have basic coverage doesnt necessarily mean that it has to be government funded but we ought to make sure of that i am less concerned about multitiers as long as what were providing for the lowest income is acceptable to us as a country in terms of what it provides and the quality of care with which it is provided there will be some areas of illness where in order to try and resolve that illness will involve taking great long shots using technology that is at the cutting edge or still in experimental stages that will involved even therapeutics that are the equivalent of hailmarys in medical care and i think it is not reasonable to say we wont let a rich person spend their money that way if they want to i think it is unreasonable and unlikely that we would do that for every individual in our country and if we get too hungup on that issue well never resolve the fact that we a have a third of our uninsured population who are at or very near the poverty line thats something surely we can fix back to top sage reference  wilensky gail r skip to main content profile login sign into your profile to save and share content across sage knowledge

topics costs and spending drugs and medical technology medicare payment policy comparative effectiveness research and medicare gail wilensky’s view gail r wilensky february   editor’s note in the october issue of health affairs steven pearson and peter bach proposed a new medicare payment model incorporating comparative effectiveness research under the model services offering greater health benefits than an existing alternative would receive costbased reimbursement but services offering benefits only comparable to an existing alternative would receive a “reference price” equal to the reimbursement rate for that alternative new services for which comparative effectiveness evidence was inconclusive would receive costbased reimbursement for a limited time but they would then drop back to the reimbursement rate for existing alternatives if new evidence demonstrating superior benefits did not emerge below gail wilensky reacts to this proposal other health affairs blog posts today offer reactions from kathy buto and sean tunis the article by steve pearson and peter bach “how medicare could use comparative effectiveness research in deciding on new coverage and reimbursement” raises several important issues about the way coverage and reimbursement decisions are currently made for medicare it also suggests some ways to incorporate the principles underlying comparative effectiveness research cer into cms decisionmaking  the arcane procedures that are part of currentlaw policy are important to understanding the stovepiped nature of medicare payments as well as some of the peculiar outcomes of the current system the complexity of the coverage and reimbursement specifics that are produced with these different calculations are breathtaking  fixing these problems is—well—daunting at best as pearson and bach remind us decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement reflect a lot of history  coverage may reflect a national decision for coverage or may follow the local coverage decisions of various carriers  on occasion congress directs medicare to cover a disease or procedure such as they did with end stage renal disease  reimbursement decisions are much more complicated than coverage decisions and the structure that they follow tends to be settingspecific which is why the same service that is performed in different settings can be reimbursed so differently  for more than a decade — including the time when i chaired the medicare payment advisory commission — medpac commissioners and others have been expressing frustration at this inconsistency rehab services provided in nursing homes versus rehab services provided in other settings has been a frequently cited example  similar problems exist whenever the same service is provided in multiple settings  while it would be possible to “force” a common reimbursement across settings if done in isolation this would distort whatever relationship exists between the service involved and the various other services provided within the same setting  redoing entire reimbursement systems even when there is widespread agreement that they are fundamentally flawed is extremely difficult as evidenced by our current struggles over the sustainable growth rate and the medicare physician fee schedule proposed strategy despite the significant differences in how medicare reimbursement strategies are designed as pearson and bach note medicare reimbursement generally reflects the cost of the service directly or based on historical estimates that are then periodically updated basically the strategy that pearson and bach propose for incorporating comparative effectiveness research into reimbursement would only change medicare’s reliance on cost as the basis for reimbursement in a limited way  reimbursement would continue to reflect cost but for those services or products that are found to be clinically comparable to an existing service or product the reimbursement would reflect the cost of the comparable service or product rather than its own cost  this is similar to reference pricing a reimbursement strategy that is used frequently in other countries particularly for pharmaceuticals  it is also similar to a strategy that is used occasionally in medicare known as “least costly alternative” where reimbursement may be limited to the reimbursement for a lower priced product  it is my understanding that there has been considerable dispute about how and when cms can make use of the “least costly alternative” principle and in some instances congress and the courts have intervened and prohibited its use the innovation that pearson and bach bring is to explicitly tie the reimbursement of a new product or service to its comparative effectiveness relative to an existing product or service  those that can be shown to be clinically “superior” would be reimbursed using the customary costrelated reimbursement strategy  those that were not clinically superior would be reimbursed at the existing comparable product’s level  those for which there is insufficient evidence would be reimbursed at the higher level that would normally be set for a new product for an initial three year period after which they would be reevaluated for evidence of clinical superiority  if clinical superiority can be demonstrated the higher price would continue otherwise the reimbursement would fall to the level of the competitor product i support the basic strategy pearson and bach present especially separating the relevance of cer for reimbursement as opposed to coverage  although some may argue that distinguishing lack of coverage from the lack of appropriate reimbursement is a difference without meaning conceptually the distinction is important  if the product or service is safe and effective it should be able to be provided however if it doesn’t do more than what is already on the market it’s not clear why there should be any higher payment  the principle is clear enough  establishing the answer empirically may be more of a challenge i’m not quite sure why pearson and bach seem so concerned about whether three years will be precisely the right period of time for all innovations  the answer is it will surely be inadequate for evaluating some innovations and perhaps generous for others  it seems to me that cms could be authorized to allow an additional twoyear extension of the original reimbursement whenever there appeared to be convincing evidence that the manufacturer had attempted to collect evidence in an expeditious way but that significant questions remained unanswered or unresolved after three years challenges the challenges are both technical and political  pearson and bach clearly appreciate the difficulties in defining what will be termed “superior” versus “comparable” clinical effectiveness  the discussion regarding the potential challenges of amassing an adequate base of evidence within  years also indicates that they are not underestimating the challenges associated with comparator measurements  they also recognize both the importance of and the difficulties associated with measuring patient preferences in establishing comparable or superior comparative clinical effectiveness  they also raise the question as to whether this approach should be only for new products and services or for existing ones as well the resolution of these as well as other technical and measurement issues will require greater consensus than now exists but should be aided by the methodology committee that was established by the affordable care act to advise the patientcentered outcomes research institute pcori  whatever views ultimately prevail any changes will need to go through the rulemaking process if they are to become a part of medicare reimbursement strategy assuming legislative authority is provided  given the controversial nature of these issues rulemaking is likely to be an arduous process  as to whether this approach should be used only for new products and services or existing ones as well a reasonable strategy is to start with new products and services in order to clearly establish the principle   over time however whenever there are several different products or services in the same space that are both highcost and highvolume an assessment to establish clinical superiority for the higher reimbursed products should also be undertaken  because the “pushback” for existing products is likely to be greater than for new products and services this assessment should only be undertaken after the principle of superior clinical effectiveness in exchange for higher reimbursement has been clearly established the technical issues involved with establishing superiority versus comparability in terms of clinical effectiveness are not likely to be as challenging as the political challenges  congress or at least some members of congress was skittish about including costeffectiveness analyses as part of cer as well as about how cer might ultimately be used this was reflected in the various provisions and limitations relating to cer in the economic stimulus legislation arra as well as in provisions in the affordable care act for example although pcori was not envisioned as a decisionmaking body the aca makes clear that it isn’t to mandate coverage reimbursement  etc  in addition to these prohibitions the language reflects the intent of the congress that evidence from research should be part of a larger process used for coverage decisions rather than the sole basis for such decisions and that evidence should not be used in such a way that benefits to people with disabilities would be assigned lower values  none of the prohibitions in the statutory language either of arra or the affordable care act directly relate to the use of a form of reference pricing that reflects clinical effectiveness comparability such as is being suggested  of course nothing in the statute allows it either and cms would need statutory authority to establish this type of reimbursement strategy as a sidebar in their discussion of the use of two prices for intensitymodulated radiation therapy one for higher risk patients and a lower one for other patients pearson and bach say that medicare has never tried making such differential payments but that is not quite accurate   when i was the hcfa administrator the agency was struggling about when to pay the higher costs associated with the use of low osmolardensity contrast material  the american college of radiology was asked or offered—i can’t remember which to identify the conditions where the use of the more expensive contrast medium was clinically important  in those cases a higher payment was made in all other cases payment was based on the lowercost contrast material although hospitals were free to use whichever contrast medium they preferred an alternative framework for using cer in medicare as i’ve indicated i support the strategy of not providing higher reimbursement for products and services that do not provide clinically superior outcomes or only providing higher reimbursements for the subgroups where superiority can be demonstrated  i also support the notion of providing a limited time frame for companies to be able to claim superiority without actually being able to prove it  companies that need more than three years could even be asked to assume partial risk for the differential payment  the question is whether there might be a concept that is more comfortable than pearson’s and bach’s framework for the congress and the public to use that also incorporates cer into medicare’s reimbursement policies what is the best way to push these ideas forward  my suggestion is to think about incorporating the concepts of cer into medicare reimbursement as part of the more general move to valuebased insurance and valuebased reimbursement rather than as a standalong change  the concept of valuebased reimbursement is present in several provisions of the affordable care act including the use of a valuebased purchasing for hospitals in  as well as the development of plans for valuebased purchasing for nursing homes home care and ambulatory surgical centers  limiting higher levels of reimbursement only to those services and products that have demonstrably superior clinical outcomes is completely consistent with the use of vbr and should be regarded as part of the more general move to vbr it would be even more useful to incorporate notions of valuebased insurance into this process  under vbi principles the lowest copayments would be used for those products and services that have the best clinical outcome in general or for a particular subset of the population  similarly products and services whose outcomes are highly uncertain or of less clinical value would have higher copayments  this type of tiered copayment is very familiar to the public since most insurance policies have used some variant of it for pharmaceutical benefits for more than a decade  the difference is that now the lowest coinsurance or copays would be for the services with the highest or more certain clinical outcomes just as the adoption of tiered copayments by part d medicare drug plans was a nonevent following several years of use by the private sector perhaps the adoption of tiered copayments reflecting comparative clinical effectiveness could become a nonevent for medicare if it were to be adopted first by the private sector  unlike medicare employers sponsoring coverage and private insurance companies don’t need the congress’ permission to adopt innovative payment strategies although the aca places some limits on changes that can be introduced by plans that wish to be considered as grandfathered thus to me the best way to incorporate cer into medicare reimbursement is to think of it as part of the move to vbi and vbr and to push hard for innovative employers and private sector insurance to begin adopting these principles as soon as possible  fortunately this seems to have been happening

gail r wilensky phd john m olin senior fellow project hope on january   mr chairman and members of the committee thank you for inviting me to appear before you my name is gail wilensky i am the john m olin senior fellow at project hope an international health education foundation and chair of the physician payment review commission i am also a former administrator of the health care financing administration however i am here today to present only my own views on medicare and my testimony should not be regarded as representing the position of project hope or pprc in my comments i will discuss some of the short and long term implications of changes in medicare policy my concern is that most of the reforms considered in the last session of congress and those already being raised in this session do not resolve the long term problems of medicare and in most cases not even the intermediate financing needs of medicare the public needs to be more aware of the magnitude of the changes needed to keep the hospital insurance trust fund afloat for the next decade the need for reform although medicare has been one of our most popular social programs it has some major weaknesses and is in serious need of reform the most significant problems concern the financing of medicare and the need to restructure medicare so that the benefits that have been promised to our seniors can be delivered at a sustainable rate of growth in spending medicare’s current financing problems pose short term intermediate term and long term difficulties for the program in the short term medicare part b represents a major drain on the budget since threequarters of its spending is financed from general revenue this spending exacerbates the deficit and makes it more difficult to reach a balanced budget in the intermediate term the hospital insurance hi trust fund will become bankrupt in the next four years and under current projections will accumulate enormous deficits over the next ten years in the longer term with the retirement of the baby boomers medicare is not financially viable and its future insolvency raises serious questions about the design of a program that will be sustainable in the st century spending rates and solvency issues at a time when spending in the private sector has slowed significantly spending on medicare continues at unsustainable rates using the recently released congressional budget office january  baseline estimates medicare is still projected to grow at a rate of almost   percent per year over the next five year budget period comparatively during this same period total federal budget outlays are only projected to grow at an average annual rate of  percent and the gross domestic product is projected to only grow at an average annual rate of  percent the projections for the solvency of the hi trust fund remain alarming most of the lower spending growth  percent per year projected for medicare from the  baseline came from part b reductions the trust fund is still projected to be bankrupt in  with accumulated deficits of more than half a trillion dollars by  in order for the trust fund to survive another decade we would have to find a way to sustain an annual growth rate of  percent per year instead of the  percent growth rate currently projected for part a this is a much more radical change than any of the proposals of the last session had contemplated present structure of medicare despite all of the changes occurring in the private sector medicare continues to remain primarily a feeforservice program with limited availability of and participation in managed care the projections for  indicate an expected enrollment of  million seniors in riskbased hmo’s representing  of all enrollees while the enrollment in hmo’s has grown rapidly over the last several years and is expected to continue growing rapidly for the next decade even by  it is expected that two thirds of the medicare population will still remain in the traditional program there are several reasons that explain the relatively small numbers of seniors in managed care but one of the most important reasons is the limited types of nonhmo managed care options available to the medicare population the very population that most needs and probably most desires flexibility medicare select a ppo offering for medigap is finally available across the country and a heavily regulated type of pointofservice plan was made available in  but is not yet available everywhere a medicare choices demonstration is setting up a number of provider service network and partial capitation models but it will be years before an evaluation of this limited set of options is available in addition to the limited options that have been available and lack of incentives for the elderly to be cost conscious there are some significant problems with the way payments are made to hmo’s payments to hmo’s reflect the medicare spending per capita that occurs within that geographic area these payments called the adjusted average per capita cost aapcc vary enormously from a high of around  per person per month to a low of  per person per month differences in the aapcc primarily reflect very different practice styles and volumes of services used although to a lesser extent they also reflect differences in costs of living not surprisingly hmo growth has been greatest in the areas where the capitation rate is very high and hmo’s are able to offer many extra benefits at no additional cost to the senior by setting the capitation payment rate at  of the rate of spending that occurs under the traditional program and having the traditional program operate as an openended entitlement the government guarantees it cannot save money by having seniors choose an hmo other than the  it would save assuming there was no favorable risk selection the issue of risk selection however has raised the possibility that the capitation payment may actually cost the government money this would happen if the elderly choosing hmo’s are healthier than the elderly in their same agesex categories and if they would spend less than  of the average were they to stay in traditional medicare while it appears that the elderly choosing an hmo use less services and are healthier the year before they enter an hmo it is unclear whether favorable selection persists over time for those who remain in hmo’s in sum the present structure of medicare hardly makes it surprising that it is facing financing problems the elderly have limited options in the health care plans available to them medicare pays most of the costs for the services it covers and almost all of the elderly have coverage that is supplemental to medicare either privately purchased medigap or medicaid that means there is little reason for an elderly person to seek out costeffective physicians or hospitals or to use lower cost durable medical equipment laboratories or outpatient hospitals hospitals and physicians also have little reason to provide costeffective care if there is any medical gain to be had from providing more services and some reason to fear legal repercussions if they do less than they might have done and the patient has an adverse outcome payments to capitation plans follow payments in fee for service and to the extent risk selection occurs may even cost the government money ultimately we need to reward the elderly for choosing more costeffective health care to provide incentives for physicians and hospitals to order and prescribe costeffective medicine and be willing to share the savings which an aggressive reorganization of health care can produce restructuring medicare the use of a better designed aapcc the payment currently used for hmo’s could become the basis for a voucher type payment which would encourage more costeffective choices by seniors in order to make this transformation it would be necessary to redesign the determinants of the aapcc to make it more stable than it is now and to take better account of risk selection than appears to occur it also needs to be decoupled from spending in an openended entitlement either being set by competitive bid or by administrative fiat government spending in the traditional medicare program also needs to be limited to the same rate of increase as in the capitated plans if seniors are to be encouraged to choose between traditional medicare and capitated plans and among capitated plans on the basis of their costeffectiveness the closest approximation of the structure i believe would be a better model for a reformed medicare program is the federal employees health benefits plan fehb in which traditional medicare would become one of the plan offerings and the premium payment by the government would be the same irrespective of the choice made this model assumes many more choices available to seniors than is currently available an annual enrollment process more information available to seniors about the choices available monitoring or control of the enrollment process and oversight of plan performance the level of payment could be set by a weighted average of plans available by a competitive bid of plans in an area or as a percent increase over existing rates some specific medicare problems aside from the more general issues of restructuring medicare there are some specific problems facing the medicare program which need to be resolved the traditional medicare program is expected to be the dominant program for at least the next decade there are management strategies which are routinely used by the private sector to improve efficiency which could be used in medicare these include physician profiling case management practice guideline and the bundling of payments several of these have or are currently being tried by hcfa as part of a demonstration but hcfa needs to be able to take the early results of demonstrations and move on them more rapidly than has seemed possible in the past there are several areas in part a of medicare that need to be addressed in the near term these include strategies for slowing the growth in home health hospice and other nonhospital services through prospective payment copayments or other policies and reforming payment methodologies for hospital outpatient departments there are also several areas concerning physician payment under part b that need to be addressed in the near term these include the implementation of resourcebased practice expense values and the move to a single conversion factor under the relative value system finally there are several areas concerning the aapcc that need to be addressed regardless of whether it becomes the basis for restructuring the entire medicare program these include limiting the extreme variations in the aapcc and introducing better risk adjusters also both as part of the aapcc and as a more general issue in medicare reforms need to be made in the payments that are being made for graduate medical education much of the attention in the months ahead will be on ways to produce medicare savings needed for a balanced budget bill it will be very important that the congress be selective about the types of short term savings that are pursued to be sure that they are consistent with a reformed medicare structure some changes are consistent with the move to an incentivebased choice structure some are neutral and some may move the system in the wrong direction for example adding a  percent coinsurance for home health or a fixed copayment for rehabilitation hospital admissions would raise additional revenue lower utilization in these areas and make managed care options more attractive similarly “bundling” postacute care services capitating those areas of part a which have been growing very rapidly over the last several years and will continue to grow more rapidly than the remainder of part a for the rest of the decade will also make managed care plans that tend to cover these components more attractive and discourage their utilization in the feeforservice world reducing payments to indirect medical education or direct medical education would be neutral with respect to its effect of the choice of the elderly regarding costeffective health care plans although it would obviously affect academic health centers and teaching hospitals but large reductions in overall physician fees could lead physicians to compensate with substantial volume increases in their own services or in ancillary services in their offices which would mitigate some of the savings and exacerbate the divisions between feeforservice and atrisk medical practice it is possible to accommodate the need for shortterm revenue increases and also set the stage for the more fundamental changes in the incentives information and options that are needed to reform the medicare program since it will take some time to restructure medicare and to realize the gains from reforming medicare it is important that these reforms be started as soon as possible this session of congress is none too soon to start gail r wilensky of unitedhealth group inc board

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples
