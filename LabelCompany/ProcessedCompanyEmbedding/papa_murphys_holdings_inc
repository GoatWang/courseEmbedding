retailwholesale » retail  restaurants zacks earnings esp expected surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks

debtmarketplacethe mortgage reit forumsummarythe product is excellent and the valuation is extremely attractivethe restaurant level financials have one major problem margins are too weakthey should attack the problem by improving advertising effectivenesstargeted advertising through either facebook or refining their direct mailing strategy could improve the effectiveness of their advertising dollarsinstead of using that logical business plan management is turning the franchising model on its head by paying franchisees no joke this plan is terribleresearching papa murphys nasdaqfrsh was a bit of a strange mistake the company makes an excellent pizza and prices it at an exceptional value this is the opinion of a frequent customer once per month sometimes twice the stores offer a great value with fresh ingredients but the shares are very different the company trades at an incredible value despite the pe ratio but the business plan is anything other than fresh this is a case where the company could take off but some mindboggling decisions are holding the company back the value is so compelling i was about to come out with a solid bull rating until seeing how the company plans to establish growth where is the value this is effectively a restaurant so i use ev to ebitda as the primary ratio for evaluating it the company is trading at about x ebitda this is despite ebitda being weakened by a few fundamental issues ill go into those soon the point i want to make here is that dominos nysedpz and papa johns nasdaqpzza are trading at about  and x ebitda respectively overall for the restaurant sector i consider those valuations rich on the other hand  is just exceptionally cheap so why does papa murphys trade at such a weak valuation when the competitors are demanding massive multiples the numbers there are plenty of numbers investors could look through but there are a couple that really tell the tale frsh was buying back franchise locations which is usually a bad sign when the franchisees feel they have a poor investment that is a huge red flag so why are franchisees unhappy i pulled the numbers for the trailing  quarters of  and compared it to the same  quarters of  to establish restaurant level margins for the franchisee this represents the expected business performance however papa murphys locations owned by the company are not paying franchising fees so their margins are artificially stronger below youll see the values i ran through a simple spreadsheet allow me to put this simply  for restaurant margins is exceptionally weak even  isnt very good  to  is normal for a franchiseworthy restaurant the simple and stupid response to this problem would be to target the relatively high cost of food and packaging which was running around  normal is a bit lower around  but papa murphys is a lower cost store that prides themselves on fresh and natural ingredients if they compromise on the quality of the ingredients they would irreparably damage their brand i speak as both an analyst and a frequent customer their labor is a little bit on the expensive side as well but i dont think their paying high wages i didnt see any employees driving sports cars the problem is lack of leverage on the fixed costs here how do they get higher leverage they need to be able to drive sales higher at the stores a little expansion in their business volume would dramatically improve those numbers with the advertising costs i would like to see papa murphys squeezing a little more value out of their advertising dollars two ways to improve advertising effectiveness the first option i would suggest is looking at what facebook nasdaqfb can offer facebook does an incredible job of delivering extremely targeted advertisements this would be a great way for the company to work on getting the most out of each advertising dollar papa murphys should really strive to maximize their advertising and it wouldnt be hard for facebook to deliver the advertisements to people who have posted things containing fresh ingredients or pizza to be clear facebook is quite arguably the best advertising company we have ever seen too bad the market is completely aware of facebooks excellence and priced it accordingly regardless facebook would be a great partner for delivering their advertisements the second option would be to refine their direct mailing campaign they mail a ton of coupons trust me i get more than i could possibly use those coupons are expensive to mail but they contain tracking numbers since i have a small drawer where all the food coupons go tricks i learned before i had money i went and pulled out some old ones the tracking numbers didnt include a consistent number or even a consistent organizational scheme that is unfortunate when papa murphys is going to hit literally  homes with these coupons they could devise unique identifiers for each residence since the mailers include the customer residence they could be efficiently tracking which coupons show up in the store if youve sent a house  coupon mailers and they have not used a single one is it really worth mailing them frequently this is a simple enough method to track and the unique residence code dont tell the customer what the code means can be entered whenever the store is slow the marginal cost should be extremely low a really terrible strategy rather than using those strategies papa murphys had their own plan to expand sales it is terrible they will waive all franchisee fees for  years to encourage qualified applicants to sign up as new franchisees when the product is good you dont give it away for  years you can give a taste but you dont expect mcdonalds nysemcd to do this remarkably the plan then goes on to include paying the franchisee what the heck up to  to help with opening costs then they can receive a  per month rebate for each store opened during the first  years… this isnt a bad plan it is arguably the single worst plan ive ever heard let me assure you ive heard some terrible plans i have a friend that moved to iowa youre welcome joe okay so this is the second worst plan ive ever heard management can justify this plan on the premise that stores do significantly better when they have more locations because they need to reach a critical mass so local advertising budgets are large enough to build consumer awareness the solution to that is to stop expanding into new markets just stop fix the business that exists they have  locations  companyowned rest franchised and if most of those restaurants were consistently showing margins around  this stock would be worth vastly more franchisees would happily come to the business because they could make money from selling a great product at an attractive price instead papa murphys wants to pay the franchisees no royalty fees and papa murphys pays them… this stock shouldve been a great buy the valuations are insane on the attractive side but they arent quite as insane as the plan for growth this is not how to run a restaurant or how to run a franchising business if they get a new ceo currently have an interim ceo and he establishes some intelligent plans this could become an extremely attractive stock for now ill keep sitting on the sidelines and waiting for the board to realize they are supposed to be running a business disclosure iwe have no
