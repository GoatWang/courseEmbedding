reviews  innovative product a lot of flexibility mar   dana mcdonald senior counsel under armour  overall    ease of use    customer support comments onit has proven a great partner both in terms of its product features and the customer service support the onit team provides onit provides a very nimble product that can be quickly modified and adapted for various business needs this is not the case with the other products we considered in this space my experience of onit is that they are motivated not only to sell their product at the outset but to continue to improve the product and ensure customer success in the adoption and use of the product its been a great experience so far makes my job easier jan   kirsten taitelbaum director of legal finance and operations davita healthcare partners inc  overall    ease of use    customer support comments i love the onit apps i seem to find most of my problems can be solved with an onit app they are very easy to get set up and the customer support team is great at responding quickly and making updates as we identify changes we need we were manually tracking data in excel files and our different departments had different excel files that didnt match up our file was never up to date and anytime we needed metrics we had to go through a  day effort to try to pull the information together from systems and the excel file now we integrate with the system and hold the data all in our onit app and the other department uses it to interact with us so we can all be looking at the same information it has improved our intake process too we have recently found that other departments are now asking us for access to the information we have in there because it is so valuable the reporting tools are still a work in progress for them but we can easily get all the data we need out of the system to create any reporting we need great product great team of people i highly recommend vendor response by onit on january   we are always thrilled to hear that our apps make life easier for clients onits contract intake app jan   libby troughton senior manager legal business operations the home depot  overall    ease of use    customer support comments home depot in conjunction with onit developed several contract intake apps in order to streamline our process for contract review requests coming into the legal department previously we had no formal process for our client to request legal services relating to reviewing and negotiating contracts now with our intake app our clients can simply fill out an easy to use online form which provides us with all the necessary information in order to generate a new contract or review any addendums etc relating to an existing contract they can also attach existing relevant documents that request is then sent to the legal department where an attorney is assigned the matter and the review begins all communications with our clients are through the onit app eliminating emails and keeps all communications in one central location as it relates to that particular contract this has been an exceptional process improvement for our client communications reporting metrics and speed in which we can turn around contracts our client have embraced this new process and use it daily vendor response by onit on january   the home depot is an invaluable onit partner we are thrilled to know that we provide them with this kind of value show more reviews
