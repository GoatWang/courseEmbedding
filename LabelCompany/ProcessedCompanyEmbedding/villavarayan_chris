defense and specialty businesses villavarayan most recently served as vice president global manufacturing and supply chain management for meritor previously he was managing director for meritor india where he lived for two and a half years during that time he led meritor heavy vehicle systems india ltd a joint venture with the kalyani group in mysore india prior to that villavarayan was general manager operations planning and strategy at meritor we caught up with villavarayan by phone while he was at the american trucking associations technology  maintenance council annual meeting in nashville tenn last monthhdt you introduced several new products at tmc what would you say your most exciting one was villavarayan i think its the meritor tire inflation system our product were launching in late  or early  with mtis you have better fuel economy but also a very large play on downtime it takes the driver out of the equation by having an automated tire inflation system as opposed to something that just does monitoring this will essentially ensure the tires are always inflated to the right pressure so you take out the possibility of having to worry about downtimeweve had automatic tire inflation on the trailer axle for so long and its been going great we looked at it and said why not look at this on the tractor side on a tractor you can look at the front axle and say that would be no different than trailer axle its the rear axle that really takes the work the engineering teams have found a great way to pressurize the tandem setfor our x our bread and butter axle in north america were launching some new axles for downsped applications for that whole downspeeding application we have that whole package to integrate to the engine and the transmissionand beyond that we showcased the x axle which is our bread and butter axle in europe the x is the laserwelded axle from europe we removed a lot of bolts its much lighter weight we will be seeing that here this fallwe also announced a new trailer axle the mtec our current version is  inches in diameter but were coming in with a inch thinwall and reduced about  pounds of weight its a great product because it is a broader diameter an inch wider so you get better torsional benefit and less bending at the wheel end so less tire wearhdt when you got your engineering degree did you think youd someday end up in a position like this was top leadership your goalvillavarayan laughs actually im the wrong type of engineer – im a civil engineer i graduated out of mcmaster university in canada a very long time ago i think i spent about two years on the civil side then i had opportunity to work for an automotive company a partnership between honda and two japanese robotics companies i did that for a couple years and joined meritor in a lot of my time with meritor it was in operations… i started working through levels of plant management then took over a specific initiative called manufacturing performance plus to look at our network in  looking at our manufacturing footprint globally and looking at ways to optimize that… we optimized the footprint reduced the number of facilities decided what manufacturing we considered core and noncore and a large piece driven in to lean and optimizing our facilities and supply chain from there i spent some time in europe running european facilities then i went on to india to take on a business role running our joint venturehdt what was it like in india compared to north americavillavarayan it was a great time to go the market was just picking up it was just an incredible opportunity to go there at a time of incredible growth it moved very very fasthdt what has it been like shifting your focus to north and south americavillavarayan  after i came back from india for a year and a half i ran global operations so we had all our facilities reporting into me what we did last year was we went to more of a pl structure i took north and south america and joe plomin who had the sales side took europe and asia so a part of the role is essentially what ive been doing before the sales side was part that was newthe similarity with india is the focus on the growth of the product the best part of being here today is talking about all the new products were launching thats the similarity to being in india through that period we were just launching a lot it moves fast your product cycle feels fasterhdt how does that reorganization benefit the company and the end uservillavarayan i think the reason we changed the focus is  so we can move fasterif you look at m our threeyear plan to make sure as a company we hit a  ebitda target there are four pillars the first one is operations the second is business and sales growth the third is materials and supply chain and the fourth one is our peopleall of that kind of ties in with having one person look at it from a pl perspective and be able to be coordinated and drive that better – lets call it faster and better alignment we have gone nine quarters of being well on the path to hitting mhdt what would you say the biggest challenges have been in your first yearvillavarayan laughs i think its just been a very good experiencein terms of challenges because i have north and south america i think a bit of a challenge has been the market in south america weve seen a  to  reduction in production volume the opposite of north america you also have a very strong devaluation in the currency which impacts the revenue assumption and also impacts stuff we bring in and take out there are localization rules in place so there has to be a certain level of local content and as we aim to hit that target one of the things we struggle with obviously is the cost of that keeps escalating because the inflation in brazil is very significanton the north american side i wouldn’t say there has been too much of a challenge its just been incredibly exciting just before i came into the role we closed a fouryear agreement with daimler and a sevenyear agreement with volvo and we have a new sevenyear agreement with paccar we are already standard with navistar so as we look at the position we have with four major players and others in the market like hino weve just made good progress as a company from a capacity and operations standpoint weve gone through quite an uptick  i think a  to  increase in production volume year over year  and unlike previous boom years weve havent seen the hiccupshdt the trucking equipment business seems to becoming more and more global what should truck buyers and maintenance managers know about this trend how does it affect us here in the usvillavarayan in europe the demand seems to be somewhat sluggish in asia china is not ramping up to the levels we expected but india is a nugget where we are finally seeing volumes coming back up the last quarter was very good for themin terms of global trends that affect north america im going to ask joe plomin to answerplomin when you look at global trends from product standpoint look at one technology and two legislation europe tends to have a tendency to lead the world from a technology standpoint having said that theres a uniqueness of the european market that makes it not necessarily applicable across the globesecondly you look at legislation and when you look at emissions the us and europe are really neck and neck and theyre also leading the market relative to safety what you see in the developing countries now as technology becomes more cost effective more mature you see more of it making its way into brazil china asia russia i think what you see is technology leadership coming out of us and europe but adaptation and modifications to suit market needs in each of the different regions whether its cost driven or application and duty cycle driven for instance if you think of the us market the average linehaul speed is faster than elsewhere in the world so it drives a different type of truckwithin meritor we have a global product strategy team that looks at what platforms make sense to take global and what platforms are really unique regionally driven products – and we have a mix of bothvillavarayan  the x is something were bringing from europe to here the x is something being developed in india that were looking to launch as a mediumduty axle here in the future theres a lot of alignment between europe and south america this is somewhere were also striving for commonalityhdt last year eaton and meritor settled a longrunning lawsuit over transmission technology from when the zf meritor joint venture brought the freedomline to the states seems like the freedomline an automated manual may have been a bit ahead of its time what do you think of the rapid acceptance of amts in the us market over the past few years any chance meritor might look into getting back into that businessvillavarayan  no what we are doing is working with companies whether it be eaton or with volvo and daimler on ensuring that our products combined with theirs can provide a high level of integration and continue to improve the efficiency of the overall end customerhdt weve heard that in some cases more fuelefficient downsped drivetrains arent being speced correctly and there are problems with the higher torque damaging componentsvillavarayan youre correct the answer is training on the fleet side and alignment and integration with the oe side we make sure we have good alignment between the transmission the driveline and the axle we work with companies whether it be eaton or the vertically integrated players like volvo or daimler to make sure we have a product that doesn’t destroy any of the three and meet the market trend for downsped drivetrainshdt what are your focus and priorities going forwardvillavarayan  a lot of it is driven by the focus on growth next year as we look at north america the market will continue to grow so we have to continue to focus on delivering our customer requirements as we go through this very very high market i think the last time we were at these levels were  so the focus is to ensure that we dont disappoint our customers and that we continue to grow with our customersand weve talked about the many new products we have to get up and running in the next  months and finally its the operations to support the market and if we get all those done then were going to be well on our path the targets in m tags meritor axles global technology  maintenance
