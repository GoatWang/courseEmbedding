a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country

insights log in newsletters longshort equity share loading the player what is longshort equity longshort equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline a longshort equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions although this may not always be the case the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions or the other way around the longshort equity strategy is popular with hedge funds many of which employ a marketneutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal breaking down longshort equity while many hedge funds also employ a longshort equity strategy with a long bias such as  where long exposure is  and short exposure is  comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their longshort strategy longshort equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography advanced economies emerging markets europe etc sector energy technology etc investment philosophy value or growth and so on an example of a longshort equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund a popular variation of the longshort model is that of the “pair trade which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector for example an investor in the technology space may take a long position in microsoft and offset that with a short position in intel if the investor buys  shares of microsoft at  each and intel is trading at  the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing  intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal the ideal situation for this longshort strategy would be for microsoft to appreciate and for intel to decline if microsoft rises to  and intel falls to  the overall profit on this strategy would be  even if intel advances to  – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at  although much less so to get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison longshort strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs for example if interest rates are rising a hedge fund may short interestsensitive sectors such as utilities and go long on defensive sectors such as health care trading center longshort fund longshort ratio equity market neutral net exposure

federal income taxation to ensure that wealthy individuals and corporate taxpayers pay a fair share of federal income taxes its reach however now sometimes extends beyond the wealthy what is the amt the amt is a tax system that works in parallel with the regular federal income tax system—while some taxpayers use the regular system others must use the amt system the amt has its own set of forms rates rules and brackets and requires taxpayers to calculate their federal income tax using this system the amt was originally designed to capture a small number of wealthy taxpayers and ensure that those taxpayers were paying at least a minimum amount of tax unlike the regular income tax however the amt is not indexed for inflation thus over time inflation makes more and more taxpayers subject to the amt causing it to extend to more middleincome taxpayers factors that can increase the likelihood of amt how can i find out if i may be subject to the amt there are no guaranteed tests to determine in advance if you are subject to the amt if you were subject to it last year and you have a similar income and tax situation this year you will most likely be subject to it again the irs maintains a calculator the irs amt assistant to help determine if you may be subject to the amt another method is to see what you might owe under the ordinary tax system and compare it to what you might owe under the amt the taxcaster can help you estimate both amounts if your amt tax bill is higher thats the tax youll owe certain deductions and types of income can influence whether or not you are subject to the amt among the most common factors that can make an individual subject to the amt are substantial deductions for state and local income taxes personal exemptions interest on second mortgages and interest on home equity loans used for purposes other than home improvement miscellaneous itemized deductions medical expenses note that these deductions have the potential to be disallowed or treated differently under the amt system than under the normal ordinary income tax system other factors that can cause susceptibility to the amt are earning significant interest income usually taxexempt from certain private activity municipal bonds exercising incentive stock options that are deep in the money on which gain is usually deferrable and taxed as capital gain income if one or more of the above factors apply to you consider talking to your tax advisor to see if you may be able to reduce your exposure to amt effects of the amt ways you can manage your amt exposure effects of the amt if you are subject to the amt your tax bill could be significantly higher than it would be otherwise your tax bill could increase under the amt in a number of ways including you could lose deductions for state and local taxes paid you could lose the personal exemptions for yourself your spouse if you are married and any children this year the personal exemption is  thus a married couple with three dependent children could lose  in exemptions if you dont itemize your deductions you could lose the ability to claim the standard deduction the standard deduction is  for joint filers and  for singles if you have qualified dividends and longterm capital gains they are taxed at federal rates no higher than  for purposes of both the ordinary income tax and the amt however the extra income could reduce or even eliminate the amount of income you can exempt from the amt the amt exemption amounts are  for married couples filing jointly  for single and head of household filers  for married couples filing separately in future years these amounts will be subject to adjustments due to inflation if you have certain private activity bonds that are not exempt from the amt they pay a slightly higher rate of interest to compensate for the lack of exemption therefore if you are subject to the amt youll have to include interest from these bonds as part of your taxable income if you are subject to the amt you will need to file form  and possibly other forms depending on the nature of your income and deductions ways you can manage your amt exposure if you were subject to the amt last year or you think you could be subject to the amt in the future you can take steps to help minimize its impact start your plan now by using the taxcaster tool it may help you estimate your potential tax liability under both the regular federal income tax system and the federal amt system although talking to your tax advisor about your specific situation is always advisable below are four ways you may be able to reduce or perhaps even eliminate your exposure to the amt  check your taxfree mutual funds and bonds fidelitys amtfree mutual funds money market funds

and local municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal income tax andor amt however if these bonds were used to pay for such private activities as housing projects hospitals or certain industrial parks the interest is fully taxable for taxpayers subject to the amt interest dividends distributed by a municipal bond or money market mutual fund are also subject to the amt if the fund owns certain private activity bonds a funds prospectus will tell you if the fund aims to generate only amtfree interest dividends fidelity offers both amtfree municipal bond and money market funds that seek to avoid investing in any private activity bonds that generate interest dividends subject to the amt  time deductions and tax payments lets say you aren’t likely subject to the amt this year but you discover that you may be subject to the amt next year you may want to consider paying your local and state tax bills including property tax before the end of this year you could also group together other expenses for next year—such as interest on a second mortgage and investment and tax preparation fees—and pay them this year youll gain deductions that may otherwise be lost next year and you may be able to avoid amt in the current year  time your capital gains under the amt a portion of your income may be exempt from tax this year the exemption amounts will be  for married joint filers and  for unmarried individuals but the exemption is subject to phaseout based on income while capital gains generally qualify for the same lower rates under the amt as under the regular tax rules a capital gain may cause you to lose part or all of your amt exemption if you hold securities that are not publicly traded you may be able to manage this situation by delaying a sale into the next year or using an installment sale to spread the gains and potential tax liability over a number of years for example if you have appreciated private securities that would result in a  capital gain you might consider spreading the sale out over two to three years especially if you have other nonrecurring deductions that you want to use before taking any action however be sure to take into account your longterm financial plans  be careful with incentive stock options typically you dont have to include income related to the exercise of incentive stock options isos when calculating your normal tax liability with the amt you must often include iso income when you exercise the options regardless of how much longer you hold the shares received if you are likely to pay the amt consider selling your shares in the same year you exercise the options that way youll at least have the cash to pay your amt bill you could also think about exercising a few options at a time over several years to spread out the income and potential tax liability consult your tax professional for guidance appropriate to your specific situation on these and other strategies for managing your amt exposure additional

creationredemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to the funds net asset value and possibly face delisting risk considerations the funds shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in the fund one of the principal risks of investing in the fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing the funds investment portfolio the advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result there can be no assurance that the funds investment objective will be achieved the fund may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the stock market an investment in a fund containing securities of nonus issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting nonus issuers the fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors shorting may result in greater gains or greater losses short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns because losses on short sales arise from increases in the value of the security sold short such losses are theoretically unlimited the fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than inkind securities as a result the fund may be less taxefficient the fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact the funds market exposure for limited periods of time the fund may invest in the shares of other etfs and therefore the funds investment performance and risks may be related to the investment performance and risks of the underlying etfs in general as a shareholder in other etfs the fund bears its ratable share of the underlying etfs expenses and would be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the fund invests in other etfs the use of futures and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when the funds portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance the funds return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by the fund the fund is classified as nondiversified and may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers first trust advisors lp is the adviser to the fund first trust advisors lp is an affiliate of first

a base case we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time to derisk no we think derisking would be premature at least from a purely returngenerating standpoint we expect the macro environment to remain supportive of risk assets during  amid a slowbutsteady expansion in developed markets and an acceleration of growth in some emerging markets view more what’s driving the expansion what’s driving the expansion we believe this is a slowgrowth recovery best explained by cyclical economic drivers we believe the concerns about the developed world being mired in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country
