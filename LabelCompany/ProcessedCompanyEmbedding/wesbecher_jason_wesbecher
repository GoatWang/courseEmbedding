salesandmarketing strategy is the future for small business image credit john cooper  flickr jason wesbecher guest writer entrepreneur cmo mattersight ceo docket performance ignited how the new emotional workplace affects hiring retention and culture jason wesbecher customer service customer care is your best marketing strategy jason wesbecher customer loyalty think small to win customer loyalty jason wesbecher shares september   last week i was asked a thoughtful if slightly provocative question from an enterprisesales candidate i was interviewing what’s your quota he queried but i wasnt put off as a former vp of salesturnedcmo i absolutely loved the direct nature of the queryrelated marketers your sales team needs leads not inquiriesi then explained to the candidate that i do in fact have a quota in regard to leads generated and revenue booked  a success measurement thats not so different from those i had in my sales daysi suspect that the genesis of the question was rooted in two decades of salesmarketing relationship debt sure the two departments put on a good show in front of the ceo and board of directors but the snark comes out as soon as everyone retreats to his or her respective office you’ll hear people say things like “the marketing leads are terrible” or “salespeople are lazy”there is something unique about today’s selling environment that represents an opportunity to forever change the dynamics of this relationship today’s bb buyers simply don’t need the assistance of a salesperson in the same way they did a decade ago instead they rely on thoughtleadership content product reviews case studies and peer recommendations that marketing teams develop to nurture prospectsgiven this increasingly blurry line between marketing and sales it seems logical that both departments ought to grow closer together in an effort to optimize customer acquisition cmos are poised to lead this chargejust a few years ago hubspot coined the term “smarketing” which captures the notion of an integrated sales and marketing strategy back then it was an aspirational idea today it has become a necessary reality many companies are scrambling  and struggling  to put an effective smarketing strategy in place to overcome this challenge consider one thing alignment the first step is to get sales and marketing teams in agreement about who the target audiences are and what the pain points are that the product is solving once buyer personas are determined marketers and salespeople should agree on specific and quantitative definitions of a lead how does each team define a qualified lead cocreating these definitions puts everyone on the same page and eliminates complaints and accusations down the road about “bad” leadsrelated are you maximizing your prospects currency of attentionthe next step in creating a strong smarketing strategy is to agree on the numbers given my background in sales i’m comfortable with quotas and quantifiable measurements of success as cmo of mattersight im overseeing my teams progress in creating a twoway salesmarketing servicelevel agreement sla which defines how each team will help and support the other the agreement includes a commitment from marketing on the number of leads that will be generated rules for how fast sales will followup on leads and actions to be taken to engage with prospectsdepending on your organization an sla could look like thismarketing will deliver  leads per product per monthsales will make its first attempt to engage with a lead within five business hours but will make no more than four attempts in  daysonce joint success is clearly outlined with quantitative factors the final step is to live and breathe the data use dashboards to create transparency between marketing and sales quickly visualize the lead pipeline and identify where and when challenges arise dashboards and statistics can also be used to measure against the goals laid out in the slamarketing and sales have the same goal increase revenue it’s time for the two divisions to come together make agreements on how each department can help the other and create a culture of honesty and transparency the technology to do this is readily available now it’s high time that these people and processes step up and adapt to the changing bb marketrelated no referrals no problem
