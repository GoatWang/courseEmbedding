a low cost high performance green backsheet for solar panels biosolar is the leading commercial provider of biobased solar panel backsheets a backsheet is a required insulating film in all solar photovoltaic panels its primary purpose is to protect the solar panel components specifically the solar cells and wires from environmental elements such as stress or moisture which can degrade the  year life of solar panels most backsheets are made from petroleumbased plastics biobacksheet is made from plant based renewable materials biosolar�s biobacksheet is the only commercially available underwriters laboratory ul certified biobased backsheet biobacksheet has features and benefits that are unmatched by traditional backsheets from the largest supplier features benefits biobased green materials biobacksheet is lower cost than conventional backsheets by using plant based materials which are not subject to the rising price of petroleum biobacksheet makes solar panels more sustainable and renewable high thermal conductivity biobacksheet can increase the power output of solar panels by quickly transferring heat away from solar cells which lowers the operating temperature and improves solar conversion efficiency and power output monolayer construction conventional backsheets are made by laminating multiple layers of materials to provide combined functionality these layers often delaminate and degrade the life of the solar panel biobacksheet employs a breakthrough monolithic single layer construction that does not exhibit interlayer delamination certifications biobacksheet is the only solar panel backsheet certified as biobased product under the usda biopreferred� program where federal agencies and its contractors are required by law to purchase products that are biobased biobacksheet is the only biobased backsheet with ul material certification complete solar panels incorporating biobacksheet have also been ul certified at the panel level fully

 billion by  with a modern world running on electricity the need for battery storage has never been greater the ability to store energy take it on the go and use it later has opened up a new world of killer apps such as long range electric vehicles iphones and storage of renewable wind and solar energy for later use the key to enabling these killer apps is better and lower cost batteries according to a  report from lux research the global energy storage market will rise to  billion by the year  with a compound annual growth rate of  much of the growth will be in electric vehicles which will rise to  billion followed by the incumbent consumer electronics segment such as iphones which will rise to  billion with a reminder of  billion in stationary applications such as solar back up power and grid storage gtm research and the energy storage association predict that the energy storage market in the united states will triple in  and will grow from  million in  to  billion by  over  of installed energy storage capacity uses lithiumion batteries as the technology is proven and bankable high growth markets electric vehicles transportation is the fastest growing segment of the battery industry and is one of the biggest users of energy storage for example with a modest sale of  units electric vehicles will use  billion worth of batteries this represents only a tiny sliver of the worldwide market of over  million cars per year a low cost fast charging and longrange battery will enable the mass adoption and affordability of cleanenergy electric vehicles to replace fossil fuel vehicles solar energy storage one hour of solar energy can power the entire world for a day while costeffective and efficient solar panels have allowed us to convert solar energy into useful electricity the problem remains that the sun does not shine at night cost effective battery solutions can fundamentally change the face of solar energy from a daytimeonly power source to a fulltime power source as of  nearly  of us energy storage is deployed by the power companies but gtm research and the energy storage association predict that the fastest market will be deployments by endusers such as residential commercial and industrial users and is expected to be  of the overall market by  solar integration and demand charge management will primarily drive this growth consumer electronics consumer electronics include everything from mobile phones laptops power tools to flashlights will continue to be a huge segment of the market lux research estimates this to be a  billion market by  higher energy capacity and rapid charge will enable mobile lifestyles where we dont have to worry about running out of battery or be attached to wall outlets of airport terminals waiting

electrical cars to run double their current range biosolar inc reports progress on its highenergy anode material for lithium ion batteries jan   biosolar inc provided a progress report on the development of its highenergy anode material for next generation lithium batteries the company recently completed the initial test of its siliconmetal sim anode material for lithiumion batteries during this test a recent batch of the company’s sim anode material was evaluated against a benchmark siliconcarbon anode material known as one of the best silicon anode materials commercially available during the test both silicon materials were prepared to reach the energy storage capacity of over mahg at the electrode level and evaluated at full cell configuration with lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide linicoalo cathode electrodes one of the significant parameters that can project battery performance is the capacity retention after  charging and discharging cycles at identical loading prototype batteries with the companys sim anode retained  of the original capacity whereas the benchmark silicon anode retained just  of its original capacity similar private companies by

military applications and various mobile applications santa clarita ca – march   – biosolar inc otc bsrc developer of breakthrough products and materials that reduce the cost of photovoltaic pv solar modules today announced that it has received its first commercial biobacksheet order the first shipment of biobacksheet will be used for the manufacture of specialty pv panels for electric utility vehicles with anticipated further shipments to be used by military and other mobile applications the customer’s pv panels feature lightweight highpowertoweight ratio highly durable customizable shapes sizes and colors dr david lee the company’s ceo commented “this first commercial order marks an important event in the history of our company in spite of recent turmoil in the solar market we have found success customers are attracted to the unique product features of biobacksheet including single layer composition reliability efficiency and cost competitiveness though the sales cycle for specialty pv panels can be shorter than mainstream pv panels it is important to note that the durability requirements in this market segment are much more stringent than what is normally expected from standard pv components” “the length of time it takes for mainstream pv customers to complete the full purchase cycle is long but it also creates a barrier of entry for the competition” lee added “biosolar is now in position to expand sales into mainstream pv market as we have completed successful internal testing qualification and ul material certification our sales and support efforts during the past  months have resulted in certain large customers obtaining panel level ul or iec certifications we look forward to achieving our next major milestone which is receiving purchase commitments from large scale solar manufacturers” dr lee concluded “solar is one of the fastest growing markets in the world and biosolar is very well positioned to benefit from the surge in demand our patent pending biobacksheet is the world’s first and only ul certified solar panel backsheet made from renewable materials and features two distinct benefits that are unmatched by existing backsheets first biobacksheet’s high thermal conductivity rapidly draws heat away from the solar cells which can increase the power output of the entire solar panel and also improve long term durability by decreasing temperature fluctuations second biobacksheet’s usda biopreferred certification allows solar panels to be marketed as more sustainable and socially responsible and preferred by us government agencies”
