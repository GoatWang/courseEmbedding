conveyor pdf brochure receive new page full line printed brochure review quote specifications with a technical expert       pneumaticon® dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems flexicons pneumaticon dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems range from singlepoint upandin installations to crossplant systems with multiple pickup and discharge points and automated controls satisfying an exceptionally wide range of bulk conveying applications all are customengineered and fully integrated with other flexicon equipment and systems and your new or existing process pneumaticon dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems move bulk materials that are suspended in an air stream that is introduced by a positive pressure blower upstream of material intake points or by a vacuum pump that removes air from the system downstream of material discharge points material is separated from the conveying air at the use point then discharged on a batch basis via butterfly or slide gate valves or continuously via rotary airlock valves   easy conveyor line routing since conveyor lines can be routed vertically and in any horizontal direction over short or long distances through small holes in walls or ceilings flexicon pneumaticon systems are easy to integrate into production environments in which process equipment and other obstacles often exist while consuming minimal floor space diversity of products handled by one conveyor powders having wide ranging bulk densities as well as flakes pellets capsules tablets and other friable materials can be handled by a single flexicon pneumatic conveyor providing the flexibility needed to transport multiple ingredients   total evacuation pneumaticon systems fully evacuate the vessel being discharged and the conveyor line itself minimizing crosscontamination of multiingredient systems complete transfer of material also ensures that individual and consolidated batch ingredients reach their destinations accurately by weight maximizing quality while minimizing waste wide capacity range with a pneumaticon conveyor capacity can range from several pounds to tens of tons per hour feeding any destination from small packaging lines to silos and railcars moreover excessive fluctuations in the feed rate — resulting in overloading or underloading — will not damage the system   enclosed system prevents contamination totally enclosed and dustfree a pneumaticon conveying system prevents contamination of the product and plant environment allowing safe transfer of contaminationsensitive materials including dusty and hazardous products high reliability and ease of maintenance flexicon pneumaticon systems feature easytomaintain filter receivers with access doors and inspection ports as well as rotary airlock valves with optional rotor support bars for easy access cleaning and inspection   mobile and custom configurations selfcontained flexicon pneumaticon conveying systems complete with feed hopper andor pickup wand blower unit filter receiver and control package are available preengineered and configured on castermounted frames for inplant mobility designed constructed and finished to industrial and sanitary standards pneumaticon conveying systems are available in carbon steel with durable industrial finishes or stainless steel finished to standards required for industrial food dairy and pharmaceutical applications available upgrades include quickaccess and quickdisconnect fitments   compare flexible screw conveyors pneumatic conveyors and tubular cable conveyors   system types positive pressure systems positive pressure dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are typically employed to convey bulk materials from a single source to one or multiple destinations over longer distances and with greater capacity than possible using vacuum systems these systems utilize a positive displacement blower with single or multiple downstream material entry points each of which meters product into conveying lines by means of a rotary airlock valve that maintains the pressure differential between the ambient atmosphere and that of the conveying line material and air blown through the line exit at single or multiple use points where they are separated by means of a filter receiver or cyclone separator or fed directly into process vessels that are vented to downstream dust collection devices pressure systems offer higher efficiency than vacuum systems can convey over longer distances and can blow directly into process and storage vessels without the use of a rotary airlock valve vacuum systems vacuum dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are generally employed for transporting material from multiple sources such as storage vessels process equipment trucks and railcars to individual or multiple destinations unlike positive pressure systems vacuum systems allow easy pickup of materials from open containers using wands and do not impart heat to the material since vacuum systems offer superior leak containment they are often specified on the basis of cleanliness particularly when handling hazardous materials negative pressure is created by a positive displacement vacuum pump located at the downstream end of the system material typically enters the system via upstream rotary airlock valves handheld pickup wands and nonflowthroughfloodfeed pickup adapters and exits the system through filter receivers or cyclone separators that separate the material from the conveying air directly above process equipment surge hoppers storage vessels or other discharge points in addition vacuum conveying is suited to direct feeding of blenders reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are put under vacuum by a line terminating at a downstream bag house or other dust collection device eliminating the need for individual filter receivers or cyclone separators above each discharge point   components a complete range of pneumatic system components flexicon provides any and all components necessary to configure your pneumaticon system including flextube diverters wyediverters plug diverters and other line diverter configurations rotary airlock valves in all popular designs and sizes filter receivers for low to highcapacity applications cyclone separators for low to highcapacity applications gaininweight and lossofweight batching systems dust collectors and bin vents controls and electrical equipment handheld pickup wands silos day bins and other storage vessels   bag dump stations flexicons sanitary bag dump station collects dust created during manual dumping of bulk materials from bags boxes drums and other containers and allows rapid toolfree wash down optional rocker arms support the hood assembly above the hopper rim eliminating the need for operators to lift and remove the hood during cleaning and inspection shown with quickclean rotary airlock storage vessels flexicon storage vessels in carbon steel with durable coatings shown and in stainless steel are available equipped with flow promotion devices and rotary airlock valves for consistent metering of bulk material into positive pressure or vacuum pneumatic conveyor lines with optional load cells and programmable controls vessels can serve as lossofweight batching systems   inlet hoppers sanitary stainless steel inlet hopper is gravityfed from upstream process equipment or storage vessels a sanitary stainless steel rotary airlock valve at the hopper discharge can be equipped with optional support rails that allow the rotor assembly to separate from the valve body for sanitizing of all material contact surfaces and to close securely in seconds — toolfree   filter receivers pneumaticon filter receivers incorporate numerous design and construction innovations offering unsurpassed separation efficiency across all capacity ranges lowcapacity units are commonly positioned above packaging lines or smaller process equipment while medium capacity units are utilized above storage vessels and process equipment such as blenders and bulk bag fillers   silo vents this silo vent is essentially the upper section of a filter receiver that can be mounted atop an existing silo or other large vessel into which material can be conveyed vacuum receivers this modular vacuum receiver features a rugged clamptogether design that facilitates rapid disassembly for filter maintenance and cleaning whereas conventional filter receivers employ multiple smaller elements it employs a single large diameter filter cartridge and offers an ideal solution for lowthroughputrate shortdistance pneumatic conveying applications   cyclone separators unlike filter receivers cyclone separators require no filters to separate solid particles from the gas stream instead relying on cyclonic action alone an air stream containing material enters the separator at a tangential angle and is spun rapidly creating a circular flow that imparts centrifugal force to the particles which strike the wall of the cyclone and fall through a bottom outlet into a process vessel   material intake methods pressure and vacuum conveying systems commonly utilize rotary airlock valves to introduce material to the air stream handheld wands and nonflowthrough floodfeed pickup adapters can be utilized with vacuum systems   rotary airlock valves with flowthrough pickup adapters pressure and vacuum systems rotary airlock valves with flowthrough pickup adapters can be utilized in pressure and vacuum systems for both controlled metering of material into the conveying system and maintaining the pressure differential between the conveying system and ambient atmosphere   wands vacuum systems handheld pickup wands plumbed to vacuum conveyor lines with flexible hose are used to vacuum material from gaylords drums paper bags barrels or other containers   nonflowthrough floodfeed pickup adapters vacuum systems material can be introduced into vacuum conveyor lines via nonflowthrough floodfeed pickup adapters which are typically used at pickup points where lower volumes of material are fed manually   material pickup points clockwise from top left include handheld pickup wand rotary airlock with flowthrough adapter nonflowthrough pickup adapter and rotary airlock with flowthrough pickup adapter   material discharge methods material typically exits pressure and vacuum pneumatic conveyors via filter receivers or cyclone separators or discharges directly into process or storage vessels positive pressure systems can additionally employ fillpass valves to discharge material from the system at one use point or redirect the material to another use point   directly into process vessels pressure and vacuum systems both pressure and vacuum systems can feed material directly into blenders reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are vented to a downstream bag house or other dust collection device eliminating the need for individual filter receivers   filter receivers pressure and vacuum systems flexicon filter receivers separate solids from the air stream using filter media and gravity and are generally specified when materials contain smaller particles that are prone to dusting andor when dust containment is a primary requirement they are normally located above material use points and employ reversepulse jet filter cleaning to dislodge accumulated dust from filter surfaces allowing continuous and efficient separation of material from the air stream   cyclone separators pressure and vacuum systems cyclones separate solids from the conveyor air stream using centrifugal force and gravity and are typically specified when materials are comprised of larger particle sizes that are not prone to dusting although filters are uncommon they can be incorporated as a secondary means of capturing airborne solids   fillpass valves pressure systems fillpass valves are commonly used to discharge material directly into individual or multiple process vessels andor to deliver it to several destinations along a common conveying line downstream of the last fillpass valve the conveying line is normally routed to the original material source point or into a dust collection device   configurations   ﻿ atsg  air transport services group air transport services group home company profile overview atsg is a leading provider of

expertise for seamless integration with your process download new pneumatic conveyor pdf brochure receive new page full line printed brochure review quote specifications with a technical expert       pneumaticon® dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems flexicons pneumaticon dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems range from singlepoint upandin installations to crossplant systems with multiple pickup and discharge points and automated controls satisfying an exceptionally wide range of bulk conveying applications all are customengineered and fully integrated with other flexicon equipment and systems and your new or existing process pneumaticon dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems move bulk materials that are suspended in an air stream that is introduced by a positive pressure blower upstream of material intake points or by a vacuum pump that removes air from the system downstream of material discharge points material is separated from the conveying air at the use point then discharged on a batch basis via butterfly or slide gate valves or continuously via rotary airlock valves   easy conveyor line routing since conveyor lines can be routed vertically and in any horizontal direction over short or long distances through small holes in walls or ceilings flexicon pneumaticon systems are easy to integrate into production environments in which process equipment and other obstacles often exist while consuming minimal floor space diversity of products handled by one conveyor powders having wide ranging bulk densities as well as flakes pellets capsules tablets and other friable materials can be handled by a single flexicon pneumatic conveyor providing the flexibility needed to transport multiple ingredients   total evacuation pneumaticon systems fully evacuate the vessel being discharged and the conveyor line itself minimizing crosscontamination of multiingredient systems complete transfer of material also ensures that individual and consolidated batch ingredients reach their destinations accurately by weight maximizing quality while minimizing waste wide capacity range with a pneumaticon conveyor capacity can range from several pounds to tens of tons per hour feeding any destination from small packaging lines to silos and railcars moreover excessive fluctuations in the feed rate — resulting in overloading or underloading — will not damage the system   enclosed system prevents contamination totally enclosed and dustfree a pneumaticon conveying system prevents contamination of the product and plant environment allowing safe transfer of contaminationsensitive materials including dusty and hazardous products high reliability and ease of maintenance flexicon pneumaticon systems feature easytomaintain filter receivers with access doors

standards required for industrial food dairy and pharmaceutical applications available upgrades include quickaccess and quickdisconnect fitments   compare flexible screw conveyors pneumatic conveyors and tubular cable conveyors   system types positive pressure systems positive pressure dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are typically employed to convey bulk materials from a single source to one or multiple destinations over longer distances and with greater capacity than possible using vacuum systems these systems utilize a positive displacement blower with single or multiple downstream material entry points each of which meters product into conveying lines by means of a rotary airlock valve that maintains the pressure differential between the ambient atmosphere and that of the conveying line material and air blown through the line exit at single or multiple use points where they are separated by means of a filter receiver or cyclone separator or fed directly into process vessels that are vented to downstream dust collection devices pressure systems offer higher efficiency than vacuum systems can convey over longer distances and can blow directly into process and storage vessels without the use of a rotary airlock valve vacuum systems vacuum dilute phase pneumatic conveying systems are generally employed for transporting material from multiple sources such as storage vessels process equipment trucks and railcars to individual or multiple destinations unlike positive pressure systems vacuum systems allow easy pickup of materials from open containers using wands and do not impart heat to the material since vacuum systems offer superior leak containment they are often specified on the basis of cleanliness particularly when handling hazardous materials negative pressure is created by a positive displacement vacuum pump located at the downstream end of the system material typically enters the system via upstream rotary airlock valves handheld pickup wands and nonflowthroughfloodfeed pickup adapters and exits the system through filter receivers or cyclone separators that separate the material from the conveying air directly above process equipment surge hoppers storage vessels or other discharge points in addition vacuum conveying is suited to direct feeding of blenders reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are put under vacuum by a line terminating at a downstream bag house or other dust collection device eliminating the need for individual filter receivers or cyclone separators above each discharge point   components a complete range of pneumatic system components flexicon provides any and all components necessary to configure your pneumaticon system including flextube diverters wyediverters plug diverters and other line diverter configurations rotary airlock valves in all popular designs and sizes filter receivers for low to highcapacity applications cyclone separators for low to highcapacity applications gaininweight and lossofweight batching systems dust collectors and bin vents controls and electrical equipment handheld pickup wands silos day bins and other storage vessels   bag dump stations flexicons sanitary bag dump station collects dust created during manual dumping of bulk materials from bags boxes drums and other containers and allows rapid toolfree wash down optional rocker arms support the hood assembly above the hopper rim eliminating the need for operators to lift and remove the hood during cleaning and inspection shown with quickclean rotary airlock storage vessels flexicon storage vessels in carbon steel with durable coatings shown and in stainless steel are available equipped with flow promotion devices and rotary airlock valves for consistent metering of bulk material into positive pressure or vacuum pneumatic conveyor lines with optional load cells and programmable controls vessels can serve as lossofweight batching systems   inlet hoppers sanitary stainless steel inlet hopper is gravityfed from upstream process equipment or storage vessels a sanitary stainless steel rotary airlock valve at the hopper discharge can be equipped with optional support rails that allow the rotor assembly to separate from the valve body for sanitizing of all material contact surfaces and to close securely in seconds — toolfree   filter receivers pneumaticon filter receivers incorporate numerous design and construction innovations offering unsurpassed separation efficiency across all capacity ranges lowcapacity units are commonly positioned above packaging lines or smaller process equipment while medium capacity units are utilized above storage vessels and process equipment such as blenders and bulk bag fillers   silo vents this silo vent is essentially the upper section of a filter receiver that can be mounted atop an existing silo or other large vessel into which material can be conveyed vacuum receivers this modular vacuum receiver features a rugged clamptogether design that facilitates rapid disassembly for filter maintenance and cleaning whereas conventional filter receivers employ multiple smaller elements it employs a single large diameter filter cartridge and offers an ideal solution for lowthroughputrate shortdistance pneumatic conveying applications   cyclone separators unlike filter receivers cyclone separators require no filters to separate solid particles from the gas stream instead relying on cyclonic action alone an air stream containing material enters the separator at a tangential angle and is spun rapidly creating a circular flow that imparts centrifugal force to the particles which strike the wall of the cyclone and fall through a bottom outlet into a process vessel   material intake methods pressure and vacuum conveying systems commonly utilize rotary airlock valves to introduce material to the air stream handheld wands and nonflowthrough floodfeed pickup adapters can be utilized with vacuum systems   rotary airlock valves with flowthrough pickup adapters pressure and vacuum systems rotary airlock valves with flowthrough pickup adapters can be utilized in pressure and vacuum systems for both controlled metering of material into the conveying system and maintaining the pressure differential between the conveying system and ambient atmosphere   wands vacuum systems handheld pickup wands plumbed to vacuum conveyor lines with flexible hose are used to vacuum material from gaylords drums paper bags barrels or other containers   nonflowthrough floodfeed pickup adapters vacuum systems material can be introduced into vacuum conveyor lines via nonflowthrough floodfeed pickup adapters which are typically used at pickup points where lower volumes of material are fed manually   material pickup points clockwise from top left include handheld pickup wand rotary airlock with flowthrough adapter nonflowthrough pickup adapter and rotary airlock with flowthrough pickup adapter   material discharge methods material typically exits pressure and vacuum pneumatic conveyors via filter receivers or cyclone separators or discharges directly into process or storage vessels positive pressure systems can additionally employ fillpass valves to discharge material from the system at one use point or redirect the material to another use point   directly into process vessels pressure and vacuum systems both pressure and vacuum systems can feed material directly into blenders reactors and other enclosed process vessels that are vented to a downstream bag house or other dust collection device eliminating the need for individual filter receivers   filter receivers pressure and vacuum systems flexicon filter receivers separate solids from the air stream using filter media and gravity and are generally specified when materials contain smaller particles that are prone to dusting andor when dust containment is a primary requirement they are normally located above material use points and employ reversepulse jet filter cleaning to dislodge accumulated dust from filter surfaces allowing continuous and efficient separation of material from the air stream   cyclone separators pressure and vacuum systems cyclones separate solids from the conveyor air stream using centrifugal force and gravity and are typically specified when materials are comprised of larger particle sizes that are not prone to dusting although filters are uncommon they can be incorporated as a secondary means of capturing airborne solids   fillpass valves pressure systems fillpass valves are commonly used to discharge material directly into individual or multiple process vessels andor to deliver it to several destinations along a common conveying line downstream of the last fillpass valve the conveying line is normally routed to the original material source point or into a dust collection device   configurations   redirect you will be redirected to air transport services group in

is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first
