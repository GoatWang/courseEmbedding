portfolio companies by the regulated entities and the affiliated funds   it is anticipated that each regulated entity may coinvest in portfolio companies with one or more affiliated funds advised by the affiliated investment advisers andor one or more other regulated entities   the regulated entity advisers and the regulated entities believe that determining the allocation of a coinvestment opportunity based on a  pro rata  share of the capital available for investment by the applicable regulated entities and the participating funds provides for the equitable allocation of coinvestments and takes into account the current capacity of such regulated entities and participating funds to make the type of investment presented by the coinvestment opportunity    reasons for coinvesting   it is anticipated that coinvestment in portfolio companies by the regulated entities and the affiliated funds should increase the number of favorable investment opportunities for the regulated entities the coinvestment program will be implemented if it is approved by a required majority as defined below of the applicable regulated entity   the regulated entity advisers expect that coinvestment by the regulated entities and the affiliated funds or among the regulated entities themselves will provide the regulated entities with the ability to achieve greater diversification and together with the affiliated funds the opportunity to exercise greater influence on the portfolio companies in which the regulated entities and the participating funds coinvest   a bdc that makes investments of the type contemplated by the regulated entities typically limits its participation in any one transaction to a specific dollar amount which may be determined by legal or internally imposed limits on exposure in a single investment in addition the code imposes diversification requirements on companies such as the regulated entities which seek certain favorable tax treatment under subchapter m of the code   in view of the foregoing in cases when a regulated entity adviser identifies investment opportunities requiring larger capital commitments it must seek the participation of other entities with similar investment styles the availability of the affiliated funds andor other regulated entities as investing partners of a regulated entity may alleviate the necessity in certain circumstances   without the opportunity for coinvestment each regulated entity acting alone might have to forego some investment opportunities if the respective regulated entity cannot provide all of the financing required by a potential portfolio company portfolio companies may reject an offer of funding arranged by a regulated entity adviser as a result of the regulated entity’s inability to commit the entire amount of financing required by the portfolio company in a timely manner by reducing the number of instances in which a regulated entity’s individual or aggregate investment limits require the regulated entity adviser to arrange a syndicated financing with unaffiliated entities the regulated entities likely will be required to forego fewer attractive investment opportunities with the assets of the affiliated funds along with the assets of the other regulated entities available for coinvestment there should be an increase in the number of opportunities accessible to each regulated entity      see irc section b          the regulated entity advisers and the board of each of the regulated entities believe that it would be desirable for the regulated entities to coinvest with other regulated entities and with the affiliated funds and that such investments would be consistent with the investment objective investment policies investment positions investment strategies investment restrictions regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors applicable to the regulated entities   at least quarterly the board of each of the regulated entities will review the rationale for the coinvestment program and evaluate whether the program remains important to the regulated entities    mechanics of the coinvestment program   in selecting investments for each regulated entity the regulated entity advisers will consider the investment objective investment policies investment position capital available for investment and other factors relevant to the respective regulated entities they advise similarly in selecting investments for the affiliated funds the affiliated investment adviser will choose investments separately for each entity considering in each case the investment objective investment policies investment position capital available for investment and other factors relevant to that particular investing entity the regulated entity advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a regulated entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other regulated entities andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification the regulated entities however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them   the regulated entity adviser as applicable will present each proposed coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation of each investment opportunity to the directors of the relevant regulated entity’s board that are eligible to vote under section o the “ eligible directors ” the “required majority” as defined in section o “ required majority ” of a regulated entity will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the regulated entity no independent director will have any direct or indirect financial interest in any coinvestment transaction or any interest in any portfolio company other than through an interest if any in the securities of the regulated entity   all subsequent activity ie exits or followon investments in a coinvestment transaction will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this application          a regulated entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or followon investment without obtaining prior approval of the required majority if among other things i the proposed participation of each regulated entity and affiliated fund is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or followon investment as the case may be and ii the board of directors of the regulated entity has approved that regulated entity’s participation in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as being in the best interests of the regulated entity if the board has not given such approval in advance any such disposition or followon investment will be submitted to the regulated entity’s eligible directors the board of a regulated entity may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and followon investments with the result that all dispositions andor followon investments must be submitted to the eligible directors   the coinvestment program stipulates that the terms conditions price class of securities settlement date and registration rights applicable to the applicable regulated entity’s purchase be the same as those applicable to the purchase by the other regulated entities andor participating funds   the amount of each regulated entity’s capital available for investment will be determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set from time to time by the board of the applicable regulated entity or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations likewise an affiliated fund’s capital available for investment is determined based on the amount of cash on hand existing commitments and reserves if any the targeted leverage level targeted asset mix and other investment policies and restrictions set by the affiliated fund’s directors general partners or adviser or imposed by applicable laws rules regulations or interpretations   b applicable law    sections d a and i and rule d   section d of the  act generally prohibits an affiliated person as defined in section a of the  act or an affiliated person of such affiliated person of a registered closedend investment company acting as principal from effecting any transaction in which the registered closedend investment company is a joint or a joint and several

on a basis less advantageous than that of the other participant although the commission has not adopted any rules expressly under section a section i provides that the rules under section d applicable to registered closedend investment companies  eg  rule d are in the interim deemed to apply to transactions subject to section a rule d as made applicable to bdcs by section i prohibits any person who is related to a bdc in a manner described in section b as modified by rule b acting as principal from participating in or effecting any transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other

modification if not so submitted          in passing upon applications under rule d the commission will consider whether the participation by the bdc or controlled company in such joint transaction is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants

by the commission pursuant to section d and made applicable to bdcs by section i paragraph a of rule d permits an otherwise prohibited person acting as principal to participate in or effect a transaction in connection with a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profitsharing plan in which a bdc is a participant if an application regarding the joint enterprise arrangement or profitsharing plan has been filed with the commission and has been granted by an order issued prior to the submission of such plan or any modification thereof to security holders for approval or prior to its adoption or modification if not so submitted paragraph b of rule d states that in passing upon applications under that rule the commission will consider whether the participation by the investment company in such joint enterprise joint arrangement or profitsharing plan on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants   applicants submit that the fact that the required majority of each regulated entity will approve each coinvestment transaction before the investment is made and other protective conditions set forth in this application will ensure that the regulated entities will be treated fairly each regulated entity would have the ability to engage in followon investments in a fair manner consistent with the protections of the other conditions   if the regulated entity advisers or the principals or any person controlling controlled by or under common control with the regulated entity advisers or the principals and the affiliated funds collectively the “ holders ” own in the aggregate more than  percent of the outstanding voting shares of a regulated entity the “ shares ” then the holders will vote such shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on  the election of directors  the removal of one or more directors or  any other matter under either the act or applicable state law affecting the board’s composition size or manner of election   applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the independent directors will act independently in evaluating the coinvestment program because the ability of the regulated entity advisers or the principals to influence the independent directors by a suggestion explicit or implied that the independent directors can be removed will be limited significantly the independent directors shall evaluate and approve any independent third party taking into account its qualifications reputation for independence cost to the shareholders and other factors that they deem relevant          the conditions to which the requested relief will be subject are designed to ensure that the regulated entity advisers the affiliated investment advisers or the principals would not be able to favor the affiliated funds over the regulated entities or one regulated entity over another through the allocation of investment opportunities among them  to the extent there is an investment that falls within the objectives and strategies of a regulated entity and one or more other regulated entities andor the investment objectives and strategies of one or more affiliated funds it is expected that a regulated entity will coinvest with one or more other regulated entities andor one or more affiliated funds with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification the regulated entities however will not be obligated to invest or coinvest when investment opportunities are referred to them applicants submit that the coinvestment program presents an attractive alternative to the institution of some form of equitable allocation protocol for the allocation of  of individual investment opportunities to either one regulated entity or the affiliated funds as opportunities arise   applicants submit that the regulated entities’ participation in the coinvestment transactions will be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants applicants believe that the conditions will ensure that the regulated entity advisers the affiliated investment advisers and the principals would not be able to favor the affiliated funds over the regulated entities or one regulated entity over another through the allocation of investment opportunities among them because as a guiding principle the conditions permit a coinvestment transaction only if the eligible directors have made a determination that the proposed investment would not benefit an affiliated person other than the fund participating in the transaction and then only to the extent strictly permitted by the conditions   after making the determinations required in conditions  and a other than in the case of pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided for in conditions  and  the applicable regulated entity adviser will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the eligible directors and the required majority will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the regulated entity   applicants believe that participation by the regulated entities in pro rata dispositions and followon investments as provided in conditions  and  is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants a formulaic approach such as pro rata dispositions and followon investments eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation determinations and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness    g conditions   applicants agree that any order of the commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions    each time a regulated entity adviser or an affiliated investment adviser considers a potential coinvestment transaction for an affiliated fund or another regulated entity that falls within the thencurrent objectives and strategies of a regulated entity   the appropriate regulated entity adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the regulated entity in light of the regulated entity’s thencurrent circumstances    a if a regulated entity adviser deems a regulated entity’s participation in any potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate for such regulated entity it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for such regulated entity   b if the aggregate amount recommended by regulated entity advisers to be invested by the regulated entities in such potential coinvestment transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested by each participating fund collectively in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity the amount proposed to be invested by each such party will be allocated among them  pro rata  based on each participating party’s capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated up to the amount proposed to be invested by each the regulated entity advisers will provide the respective eligible directors with information concerning each party’s available capital to assist the eligible directors with their review of such regulated entity’s investments for compliance with these allocation procedures      “ objectives and strategies ” means the regulated entity’s investment objectives and strategies as described in the regulated entity’s registration statement on form n other

overreaching in respect of the regulated entity or its stockholders on the part of any person concerned    ii the transaction is consistent with   a the interests of the regulated entity’s stockholders and   b the regulated entity’s thencurrent objectives and strategies   iii the investment by another regulated entity or one or more participating funds would not disadvantage the

conclusions required by this condition ciii if   a the eligible directors shall have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer if any   b the regulated entity adviser agrees to and does provide periodic reports to the board of the applicable regulated entity with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through

fund or any affiliated person of either receives in connection with the right of a participating fund or other regulated entity to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to

the participating regulated entities in accordance with the amount of each party’s investment and          iv the proposed investment by the regulated entity will not benefit the regulated entity advisers the affiliated funds or other regulated entities or any affiliated person of any of them other than the other parties to the coinvestment transaction except a to the extent permitted by

fund or another regulated entity but not such regulated entity of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company’s board of directors the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition  if conditions ciiia b and c are met    a if any regulated entity or participating fund elects to sell exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a coinvestment transaction then   i the investment adviser to such regulated entity or participating fund will notify each other regulated entity that participated in the coinvestment transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time and

and medley aspect gp llc trends affecting our business we believe that our disciplined investment philosophy contributes to the stability of our firms performance our results of operations including the fair value of our aum are affected by a variety of factors including conditions in the global financial markets as well as economic and political environments particularly in the us during the first half of fiscal year  economic conditions continued to be unpredictable and volatile as it was during fiscal year  however during the second half of fiscal year  broad economic markets showed stability and loan volumes across the lending spectrum improved loan funds received significant inflows while clo issuances continued to increase in the second half of  both these factors drove significant volume in the loan market and drove pricing lower as a result the opportunity set for appropriate riskadjusted investments reduced our platform provides us the ability to lend across the capital structure and at varying interest rates providing our firm access to a larger borrower subset over time however we believe the deployment of capital during fiscal year  was prudent and cautious inlight of the prevailing market conditions in addition to these macroeconomic trends and market factors our future performance is dependent on our ability to attract new capital we believe the following factors will influence our future performance the extent to which investors favor directly originated private credit investments our ability to attract additional capital is dependent on investors views of directly originated private credit investments relative to traditional assets we believe fundraising efforts will continue to be impacted by certain fundamental asset management trends that include i the increasing importance of directly originated private credit investment strategies for institutional investors ii increasing demand for directly originated private credit investments from retail investors iii recognition by the consultant channel which serves endowment and pension fund investors that directly originated private credit is an important component of asset allocation iv increasing demand from insurance companies seeking alternatives to investing in the liquid credit markets and v deleveraging of the global banking system bank consolidation and increased bank regulatory requirements our ability to generate strong stable returns and retain investor capital throughout market cycles the capital we are able to attract and retain drives the growth of our aum fee earning aum and management fees we believe we are well positioned to invest through market cycles given our aum is in either permanent capital vehicles or longdated private funds and smas our ability to source investments with attractive riskadjusted returns our ability to grow our revenue is dependent on our continued ability to source attractive investments and deploy the capital that we have raised we believe that the current economic environment provides attractive investment opportunities our ability to identify attractive investments and execute on those investments is dependent on a number of factors including the general macroeconomic environment valuation size and the liquidity of these investment opportunities a significant decrease in the quality or quantity of investment opportunities in the directly originated private credit market a substantial increase in corporate default rates an increase in competition from new entrants providing capital to the private debt market and a decrease in recovery rates of directly originated private credit could adversely affect our ability to source investments with attractive riskadjusted returns the attractiveness of our product offering to investors we believe defined contribution plans retail investors public institutional investors pension funds endowments sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies are increasing exposure to directly originated private credit investment products to seek differentiated returns and current yield our permanent capital vehicles and longdated private funds and smas benefit from this demand by offering institutional and retail investors the ability to invest in our private credit investment strategy we believe that the breadth diversity and number of investment vehicles we offer allow us to maximize our reach with investors components of our results of operations management fees management fees include both base management fees as well as part i incentive fees base management fees base management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of i average or total gross assets including assets acquired with leverage ii total commitments iii net invested capital iv nav or v lower of cost or market value of a funds portfolio investments these fees are calculated quarterly and are paid in cash in advance or in arrears depending on each specific fund base management fees are recognized as revenue in the period advisory services are rendered subject to our assessment of collectability in addition we also receive non assetbased management fees that may include special fees such as origination fees transaction fees and similar fees paid to us in connection with portfolio investments of our funds these fees are specific to particular transactions and the contractual terms of the portfolio investments and are recognized when earned part i incentive fees we also include part i incentive fees that we receive from our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our longdated private funds in management fees part i incentive fees are paid quarterly in cash and are driven primarily by net interest income on senior secured loans effective january   as it relates to mcc these fees are subject to netting against realized and unrealized losses we are primarily an asset manager of yieldoriented products and our incentive fees are primarily derived from spread income rather than trading or capital gains in addition we also carefully manage interest rate risk we are generally positioned to benefit from a raising rate environment which should benefit fees paid to us from our vehicles and funds performance fees our longdated private funds and smas may have industry standard carried interest performance fee structures and are typically  to  of the total return over a  to  annualized preferred return we record these fees on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are contractually due but not paid and we present this revenue as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations these fees are subject to repayment clawback the timing and amount of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods refer to risk factors  risks related to our business and industry generally if at the termination of a fund and sometimes at interim points in the life of a fund the fund has not achieved investment returns that in most cases exceed the preferred return threshold or in all cases the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled medley had not received any distributions of performance fees through december   other than tax distributions a portion of which is subject to clawback as of december   we accrued  million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at fair value as of the end of the reporting period our actual obligation however would not become payable or realized until the end of a funds life for any given period performance fee revenue on our consolidated statements of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date since fund return hurdles are cumulative previously recognized fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular funds hurdle rate for the year ended december   we did not reverse previously recognized performance fees for the year ended december   we reversed  million of previously recognized performance fees for the year ended december   we reversed  million and  million of previously recognized performance fees on a standalone and consolidated basis respectively as of december   we recognized cumulative performance fees of  million part ii incentive fees for our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our longdated private funds part ii incentive fees generally represent  of each funds cumulative realized capital gains net of realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation we have not received these fees historically and do not expect such fees to be material in the future given our focus on senior secured lending other revenues and fees we provide administrative services to certain of our vehicles that are reported as other revenues and fees such fees are recognized as revenue in the period that administrative services are rendered these fees are generally based on expense reimbursements for the portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by certain professionals directly attributable to each respective fund these fees are reported within total revenues in
