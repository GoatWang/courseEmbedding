and cfo richard a galanti sales modeledit costco warehouse interior in mountain view california costco focuses on selling products at low prices often at very high volume these goods are usually bulkpackaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor this contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves most products have an  to  markup while the kirkland signature brand products have a  markup the company runs very lean with overhead

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor this contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor this contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and

and marketed primarily to large families and businesses furthermore costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell generally by the kirkland signature label this results in a high volume of sales from a vendor allowing further reductions in price and reducing marketing costs a typical costco warehouse carries only  distinct products while a typical walmart supercenter carries approximately  products if costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high they will refuse to stock the product for example on november   costco announced that it would stop selling cocacola products because the softdrink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices costco resumed selling cocacola products on december   costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials to carry out their goods customers must use a shopping cart bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the companys vendors lighting costs are reduced on sunny days as most costco locations have several skylights during the day electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights during an average sunny day it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use most

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible
