plug valves lubricated mrc global is a leading distributor of plug valves to the energy and industrial markets plug valves are named for the coneshaped pluglike device that controls the flow of fluid through the valve rotating the handle a quarter turn or turning the handwheel on the gearbox starts or stops the flow of fluid by introducing the through bore or solid portion of the plug the plug valve is ideal for gas transmission gas utility and chemical applications and is offered and stocked in elastomeric lined or full metal construction nonlubricated hf acid plastic lined check valves apia  apid a check valve design only allows fluid to flow one direction it is generally used in conjunction with other types of valves and will close automatically when line pressure is lost thus it has no handle to turn on and off this feature makes check valves ideal for preventing plant and equipment damage caused by excess backflow a necessity across all streams of the energy industry check valves are stocked in several body configurations and materials lift check piston check swing check wafer check y pattern check multiturn valves gate multiturn valves are opened and closed by turning a wheel more than  degrees two primary examples of this type of valve are the gate valve and globe valve to open and close the gate valve multiple turns of the handle are required to turn an acme threaded nut on the threaded shaft of the valve causing it to open or close by raising or lowering the gate these valves operate in one of two positions open or closed and are not recommended for throttling the globe valve on the other hand opens and closes incrementally and is used to modulate flow levels pressures or temperatures both the gate valve and globe valve are commonly used in downstream applications mrc global maintains large inventories of gate valves and globe valves in materials such as carbon steel stainless steel and special alloys to serve the needs of the refining
