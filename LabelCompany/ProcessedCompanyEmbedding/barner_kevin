christopher rowe was happy learning how to solve complex codes and puzzles and creating powerful medicines potions and weapons as an apprentice to master benedict blackthorn—with maybe an explosion or two along the waybut when a mysterious cult begins to prey on london’s apothecaries the trail of murders grows closer and closer to blackthorn’s shop with time running out christopher must use every skill he’s learned to discover the key to a terrible secret with the power to tear the world apartin his stunning debut novel kevin sands brings readers on a heartstopping adventure rich with suspense mystery and unforgettable characters advertising show more editorial reviews newbery honor and nyt bestselling author of savvy  ingrid law captivating a masterful pageturner brimming with secrets traps friendship intrigue pigeons potions loyalty and explosions kevin sands has created an engaging kindhearted and humorous young hero in apothecarys apprentice christopher rowe this thrilling adventure will keep you hooked author of the bestselling artemis fowl series  eoin colfer magic adventure and things that go boomi love this book bestsellling author of the spy school series  stuart gibbs an inspired blend of action adventure science history and humor filled with fascinating facts clever codes and wonderful characters the new york times book review  sabaa tahir …impeccably researched…sandss representation of the teeming stinking streets of thcentury london is remarkable in its detail…the story gains a relentless momentum in the second half when christopher shines as a humorous narrator who is flawed enough to be relatable but not so flawed that we cant imagine him succeeding in his quest perhaps the most refreshing aspect of the book is the trust christophers master places in him in a genre where many adults are either dead detached or outright villainous a caring adult with complete faith in his charges savvy is a nice change the true villains of the book are cleverly concealed resulting in a puzzlefilled satisfyingly twisty tale publishers weekly ★ firsttime novelist sands has written an exciting and selfassured tale of alchemy and dark secrets set during the latethcentury reign of king charles ii fourteenyearold orphan christopher rowe is lucky to be apprenticed to a kindly apothecary master benedict blackthorn but someone—the cult of the archangel it is rumored—is murdering london’s apothecaries believing that members of the apothecary’s guild are concealing a dangerous secret christopher is an easygoing boy fond of pranks and experiments the book opens with his illadvised and illfated attempt at mixing up some gunpowder but after master benedict is assaulted he finds himself on the run pursued by the murderous henchmen of a rival apothecary and the dangerous lord richard ashcombe his majesty’s warden sands adeptly balances the novel’s darker turns with moments of levity and humor and fills the book with nicely detailed characters and historical background—plus lots of explosions it’s a story that should have broad appeal while especially intriguing readers with an existing interest in chemistry history and decoding puzzles ages – agent daniel lazar writers house sept kirkus reviews ★ it is  london and the streets are filled with orphans thieves madmen and a few young apprentices as eager to have fun as to learn their trades fourteenyearold christopher is luckier than most the apothecary master ­­­­­­­­­­­­­benedict blackthorn is both intelligent and kind forgiving both christophers mistakes as well as his illplanned pranks but when the cult of the archangel kills his master christopher is determined to complete his masters work and bring the killers to justice however all he has for help are his friend bakers son tom and a hastily scribbled coded message from his master this stunning and smart mystery is made even better by wellresearched historical detail intriguing characters and genuinely funny moments whether accidentally shooting the shops taxidermed bear with his homemade gun powder or outsmarting a ruthless cult of killers christopher makes a terrific protagonist but its his love for his friends and master as well as his fearless intellectual curiosity that make him a true hero an epigraph sagely if unnecessarily warns against employing the many thcentury remedies while many readers will love the story it is unlikely they will try a recipe for saltpeter that involves marinating pigeon droppings in urine—but they will revel in reciting it at dinnertime an authors note discusses

the blackthorn key “let’s build a cannon” i saidtom wasn’t listening he was deep in concentration tongue pinched between his teeth as he steeled himself for combat with the stuffed black bear that ruled the front corner of my master’s shop tom stripped off his linen shirt and flung it heroically across the antimony cups gleaming on the display table near the fire from the oak shelf nearest to him he snatched the glazed lid of an apothecary jar—blackthorn’s wartbegone according to the scrawl on the label—and held it on guard a miniature ceramic shield in his right hand the rolling pin wobbled threateninglytom bailey son of william the baker was the finest fake soldier i’d ever seen though only two months older than me he was already a foot taller and built like a blacksmith albeit a slightly pudgy one due to a steady pilfering of his father’s pies and in the safety of my master’s shop away from the horrors of battle like death pain or even a mild scolding tom’s courage held no equalhe glared at the inanimate bear the floorboards creaked as he stepped within range of its wickedly curved claws tom shoved the curio cabinet aside making the brass balances jingle then he hoisted his flourdusted club in salute the frozen beast roared back silently inchlong teeth promising death or several minutes of tedious polishing at leasti sat on the counter at the back legs dangling and clicked leather heels against the carved cedar i could be patient you had to be sometimes with tom whose mind worked as it pleased“think you can steal my sheep mr bear” he said “i’ll give you no quarter this day” suddenly he stopped rolling pin held outward in midlunge i could almost see the clockwork cranking between his ears “wait what” he looked back at me puzzled “what did you say”“let’s build a cannon” i said“what does that mean”“just what you think it means you and me build a cannon you know” i spread my hands “boom”tom frowned “we can’t do that”“why not”“because people can’t just build cannons christopher” he said it like he was explaining why you shouldn’t eat fire to a small dull child“but that’s where cannons come from” i said “people build them you think god sends cannons down from heaven for lent”“you know what i mean”i folded my arms “i don’t understand why you’re not more excited about this”“maybe that’s because you’re never the one on the pointy end of your schemes”“what schemes i don’t have any schemes”“i spent all night throwing up that ‘strength potion’ you invented” he saidhe did look a little dark under the eyes today “ah yes sorry” i winced “i think i put in too much black snail it needed less snail”“what it needed was less tom”“don’t be such a baby” i said “vomiting is good for you anyway it balances the humors”“i like my humors the way they are” he said“but i have a recipe this time” i grabbed the parchment i’d leaned against the coin scales on the countertop and waved it at him “a real one from master benedict”“how can a cannon have a recipe”“not the whole cannon just the gunpowder”tom got very still he scanned the jars around him as if among the hundreds of potions herbs and powders that ringed the shop was a remedy that would somehow get him out of this “that’s illegal”“knowing a recipe isn’t illegal” i said“making it is”that was true only masters and only those with a royal charter were allowed to mix gunpowder i was a long way from either“and lord ashcombe is on the streets today” tom saidnow that made me pause “you saw him”tom nodded “on cheapside after church he had two of the king’s men with him”“what’d he look like”“mean”“mean” was exactly what i’d imagined lord richard ashcombe baron of chillingham was king charles’s loyal general and his majesty’s warden here in london he was in the city hunting for a pack of killers in the past four months five men had been butchered in their homes each of them had been tied up tortured then slit open at the stomach and left to bleed to deaththree of the victims had been apothecaries a fact that had me seeing assassins in the shadows every night no one was sure what the killers wanted but sending in lord ashcombe meant the king was serious about stopping them lord ashcombe had a reputation for getting rid of men hostile to the crown—usually by sticking their heads on pikes in the public squarestill we didn’t need to be that cautious “lord ashcombe’s not coming here” i said as much to myself as to tom “we haven’t killed anyone and the king’s warden isn’t likely to stop by for a suppository is he”“what about your master” tom said“he doesn’t need a suppository”tom made a face “i mean isn’t he coming back it’s getting close to dinnertime” he said “dinnertime” with a certain wistfulness“master benedict just bought the new edition of culpeper’s herbal” i said “he’s at the coffeehouse with hugh they’ll be gone for ages”tom pressed his ceramic shield to his chest “this is a bad idea”i hopped down from the counter and grinned•  •  •to be an apothecary you must understand this the recipe is everythingit isn’t like baking a cake the potions creams jellies and powders master benedict made—with my help—required an incredibly delicate touch a spoonful too little niter a pinch too much aniseed and your brilliant new remedy for dropsy would congeal instead into worthless green goobut new recipes didn’t fall from the sky you had to discover them this took weeks months even years of hard work it cost a fortune too ingredients apparatus coal to stoke the fire ice to chill the bath most of all it was dangerous blazing fires molten metals elixirs that smelled sweet but ate away your insides tinctures that looked as harmless as water but threw off deadly invisible fumes with each new experiment you gambled with your life so a working formula was better than goldif you could read it↓m→tom scratched his cheek “i thought there’d be more words and things”“it’s in code” i saidhe sighed “why is it always in code”“because other apothecaries will do anything to steal your secrets when i have my own shop” i said proudly “i’m putting everything in code no one’s going to swipe my recipes”“no one will want your recipes except poisoners i suppose”“i said i was sorry”“maybe this is in code” tom said “because master benedict doesn’t want anyone to read it and by ‘anyone’ i mean you”“he teaches me new ciphers every week”“did he teach you this one”“i’m sure he’d planned to”“christopher”“but i figured it out look” i pointed at the notation ↓m→ “it’s a substitution cipher every two numbers stand for one letter this tells you how to swap them start with ‘’ and replace it with m then count forward so  is m  is n and so on like this”i showed him the table i’d worked outabcdefghiklmnopqrstvxyztom looked between the cipher and the block of numbers at the top of the page “so if you replace the numbers with the right letters   ”“   you get your message” i flipped the parchment over to show the translation i’d inked on the backgunpowderone part charcoal one part sulfur five parts saltpetergrind separately mixwhich is what we did we set up on the larger display table farther from the fireplace based on tom’s reasonable suggestion that gunpowder and flames weren’t friends tom moved the bleeding spoons from the table and got the mortars and pestles from the window near the bear while i pulled the ingredient jars from the shelvesi ground the charcoal sooty clouds puffed into the air mixing with the earthy scent of the dried roots and herbs hanging from the rafters tom glancing uneasily at the front door for any sign of my master took care of the saltpeter crushing the crystals that looked just like ordinary table salt the sulfur was already a fine yellow powder so while tom swirled the ingredients together i got a length of brass pipe sealed at one end from the workshop in the back i used a nail to widen a hole near the sealed end into that i slipped a loop of woven ashcolored cordtom raised his eyebrows “master benedict keeps cannon fuse”“we use it to light things from far away” i said“you know” tom said “things you have to light from far away probably shouldn’t be lit at all”the mixture we ended up with looked harmless just a fine black powder tom poured it into the open end while i propped up the pipe a narrow stream spilled over the side scattering charcoal grains onto the floor i stamped the powder in the tube down with cotton wadding“what are we going to use for a cannonball” tom saidmaster benedict didn’t keep anything in the store that would fit snugly in the pipe the best i could come up with was a handful of lead shot we used for shavings to put in our remedies they scraped down the brass and landed with a hollow thump on the cotton at the bottomnow we needed a target and soon it had taken a lot longer to put everything together than i thought it would and though i’d assured tom that my master wouldn’t return his comings and goings weren’t exactly predictable“we’re not firing this thing outside” tom saidhe was right about that the neighbors would not look kindly on lead shot flying through their parlors and as tempting a target as the stuffed beaver on the mantel was master benedict was even less likely to appreciate us going to war with the animals that decorated his shop“what about that” i said hanging from the ceiling near the fireplace was a small iron cauldron “we can shoot at the bottom of it”tom pushed aside the antimony cups on the other table leaving enough space to put down the cauldron i picked up our cannon and pressed it against my abdomen to hold it steady tom tore a scrap of parchment from our deciphered recipe and held it in the fire until it caught then he lit the cannon’s wick sparks fizzed racing toward the pipe like a flaming hornet tom dived behind the counter and peeked over the top“watch this” i saidthe blast nearly blew my ears off i saw a burst of flame and a mound of smoke then the pipe kicked back like an angry ox
