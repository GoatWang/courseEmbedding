arizona public service save to mypower solar energy projects over the past few years have been predominantly based on photovoltaic pv cells but given enough land and flat plate collectors just about any size plant could be constructed developers are still pushing the limits on pv plants with the world’s largest pvbased plant now rated at  mw see profile of the bavaria solarpark and larger plants being actively considered perhaps the most wellknown solar thermal projects are the solar electric generating systems segs iii–vii plants built beginning in the mids and now owned by kramer junction co each of the five mw systems continues to operate reliably selling its output to southern california edison together all of the segs plants i–ix have a capacity of about  mw one unique aspect of the segs design is its ability to supplement generation to meet peak load demands by firing with natural gas during periods of low solar energy intensity since the segs installations advances in parabolic trough solar technology and organic rankine cycle orc power technology have made small parabolic trough plants more economically feasible desert developments arizona public service aps is an equally familiar name in solar energy development the utility owns an extensive portfolio of over  mw of fixed tracking and concentrating pv systems across arizona the company’s interest in solar project development literally comes with the territory—among us states arizona gets more than its fair share of sunshine these projects all have helped aps develop a keen sense of which solar technologies provide the most bang for the buck in fact the aps star facility is a worldclass solar research facility whose primary mission is understanding how these technologies perform in utility and customer applications the saguaro solar power plant sspp was designed to solve a number of pressing problems for aps and others interested in developing solar energy at the corporate level the project will help satisfy some of aps’s obligation under the arizona environmental portfolio standard eps to generate a portion of its electricity from solar resources a corollary objective is to evaluate the cost and performance of concentrating solar power csp and orc technologies for use in future renewables projects in addition the us doe’s solar technology program will use the site to help baseline the cost and performance of the current generation of parabolic trough technology and evaluate the design installation om and performance of csp designs see box   concentrating solar power technologies solar thermal or concentrating solar power csp plants have a marked resemblance to conventional steam plants the obvious difference is the fuel source a csp system concentrates solar radiation to either heat an organic working fluid or to superheat steam which then is expanded in a turbinegenerator to produce electricity in both cases the working fluid is condensed after its expansion and returned to the collector to close the cycle existing csp plants use one of three alternative collector designs table  parabolic troughs are used by the aps mw demonstration plant described in this article in the central receiver approach large mirrors track the sun and concentrate solar energy on a central tower to heat a working fluid a working fluid also is heated in the third approach but by parabolic dish reflectors that concentrate solar energy at the focal point of the individual dish   table  comparing solar thermal power technologies source concentrated solar thermal power—now

and the national renewable energy laboratory nrel—as a team known as sunlab—for technical support and to offer the project as a potential test bed for evaluation of parabolic trough technologies and thermal energy storage designs get with the program solargenix was responsible for the plant startup with aps acting as a technical consultant the plant had to be in service by december   for aps to take advantage of the solar production tax credit that expired the next day site work began in june  with grading the building of a security fence and installation of a water line from the existing

synchronous speed conditioned on solar field fluid supply and then switches the generator to the mains once linked the control system monitors and controls the operation of the generating unit the plant was designed to operate unattended to minimize om costs during the design phase generating efficiency was sacrificed to achieve those goals the plant operates in very straightforward fashion in the morning it starts up as the sun rises the solar field’s heattransfer fluid htf is circulated in bypass mode until it reaches a minimum temperature currently about f simultaneously the oec goes into its startup and warmup phases once threshold temperatures are met valves modulate to send the htf to the oec from this point forward the power block’s output is a function of solar insolation and htf temperature the oec then is operated until several operating parameters fall below certain thresholds—for example as a result of the sky becoming cloudy at that point operation of the solar field returns to bypass mode with the htf either rising to the operatingtemperature window or cooling for standby or shutdown conditions the system automatically shuts down just before sundown each day chasing the sun each sca is an independently tracking assembly of parabolic trough solar collectors every collector includes parabolic reflectors mirrors a metal support structure or space frame assembly a receiver tube and a tracking system in contrast to the ls and ls designs used at the segs plants each sca has a ft aperture like the ls but is  ft long like the ls the mirrors are identical to those used on the ls figure     capturing the sun an organic fluid is heated by solar energy concentrated by the solargenix solar collector assembly courtesy arizona public service eight scas are pieced together to form each solar collector loop the ends of the three loops in the solar field are attached to cold and hot htf headers which are routed along one side of the solar field to and from the oec power block the scas rotate around the horizontal northsouth axis to track the sun as it moves across the sky over the course of a day the axis of rotation is located at the collector’s center of mass to minimize required tracking power the drive system uses hydraulic rams to position the collector a closedloop tracking system relies on a sun sensor for the precise alignment required to focus the sun on the hce with a precision of   degrees tracking is controlled by a local controller on each sca the local controller also monitors the htf temperature and reports operational status alarms and diagnostics to the main solar field control computer in the control room the sca is designed to operate normally in winds of up to  mph and with somewhat reduced accuracy in winds of up to  mph the sca modules can withstand mph winds in stowed position the scas start to absorb heat once the sun has risen  degrees above the horizon the rate of htf flow at the main solargenix header is  gpm at a design operating temperature of f and a maximum of f the temperature of the htf changes during the day with the intensity of solar insolation because the site’s minimum ambient temperature of about f is higher than the minimum allowable working temperature of the htf there is no danger of htf freezing in the collectors the future of concentrating solar power plants under construction in nevada this february in boulder city nevada construction began on the mw solar one thermal plant figure  expected to be the thirdlargest solar power plant in the world when it begins production in march  like the saguaro solar power plant the solar one project uses schott ptr  solar receivers but it differs in how it converts thermal energy to electricity     advanced design flow diagram of the nevada solar one project source solargenix solar one will use solar concentrators to heat a thermal transfer fluid to over f and then use that hot fluid to superheat steam for driving a conventional steam turbine in this respect the solar one project is more similar to kramer junction co’s solar electric generating systems segs projects than to the saguaro plant a key difference is that improvements in plant design since the s have reduced the natural gas requirements for the solar one project to only  of capacity compared with the maximum of  at segs one of the remarkable features of the solar one design is that the plant’s steam side is virtually identical to that of a standard fossilfueled power plant except for the troughs everything else is a standard natural gas plant explained scott sklar president of the stella group ltd a distributedenergy strategic marketing and policy firm based in washington dc that’s what solargenix has always maintained you’re really buying a natural gas power block with solar attached if you’re worried about risk consider that the segs plants have been up and running for about  years and have operated nearly flawlessly indeed reliability—and what people are willing to pay for it—is a whole new ballgame there are fundamental differences between today’s electricity marketplace and the market of  years ago said rhone resch executive director of the solar energy industries association and a veteran of the natural gas industry today natural gas and peak power are incredibly expensive as a result utilities are scrambling to find generation sources that they can depend on for help in handling peak demand and plants like solar one exemplify what they’re looking for the beautiful thing about the project is that it offers firm dispatchable peak power the solar one project is being designed and led by raleighbased solargenix energy inc spain’s renewable energy giant— acciona group—which owns  of the commercial power plant division of the company the project will use  carefully arranged troughs figure  to collect the endless supply of solar energy available in the nevada desert solargenix puts the capital cost of solar one in the range of  million to  million and estimates that busbar costs will be somewhere between  cents and  centskwh solar one’s production is already committed to nevada power co and sierra pacific power co the plant is expected to begin operation in march     first in nevada artist’s rendering of the nevada solar one project now under construction courtesy solargenix lessons learned the saguaro solar power plant was funded by aps customers using money from the environmental porttfolio standard aps’s cost to build was  to  more—on a perkw basis—than the large tracking pure pv plants that aps has deployed in the past much of the additional cost was eaten up by auxiliaries associated with the trough plant—namely the evaporation pond cooling tower site development and flood control obviously the perkw cost would be much lower if the plant were made larger indeed it appears that a plant of this type with a capacity of  mw or more would be costcompetitive with nextgeneration solar thermal systems now under construction see box another lesson that aps learned was that wet cooling significantly improved powercycle efficiency during the tucson summer cost was a huge driver of the cooling water system design a dry system would have cost about  more than the wet one including the evaporation pond the former approach also would have necessitated much more om finally a performance penalty was caused by a lack of cooling capacity as well as the parasitic losses incurred by the use of more fans aps would have considered hybrid cooling system for a larger plant the author would like to recognize the many contributors to the success of this project they include the management and staff of aps solargenix ormat sandia national laboratories and the national renewable energy laboratory as well as the many site construction contractors —b scott canada is a project engineer in the renewables engineering department of arizona public service jeff lee is saguaro’s plant
