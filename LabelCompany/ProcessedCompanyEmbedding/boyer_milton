metropolitan life insurance company and owensillinois inc defendants opinion and order cvwmc plaintiffs milton and kathy boyer bring claims against defendants arising out of milton’s exposure to asbestos and a related disease malignant mesothelioma before the court are two motions to dismiss in the first motion defendant weyerhaeuser company the former owner of a door manufacturing plant where milton boyer worked and asbestos fireproofing products were produced moves to dismiss the claims brought against it as barred by wisconsin’s workers’ compensation act dkt  in the second motion defendant owensillinois company seeks dismissal of product liability claims premised solely on its licensing of a patent claiming a fireproof door dkt  for the reasons that follow the court will grant both motions and dismiss weyerhaeuser and owensillinois as defendants  owensillinois also filed a motion to order plaintiffs’ compliance with wis stat § 00 a new state statute requiring disclosure of asbestos trust claims among other provisions dkt  because the court grants owensillinois’ motion to dismiss it need not reach the merits of this motion and accordingly will deny it as moot case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  allegations of fact a the parties plaintiff milton boyer previously was employed at a door manufacturing plant in marshfield wisconsin where asbestos fireproofing products were manufactured and products containing asbestos were used in the manufacturing process plaintiff kathy boyer is his wife defendant weyerhaeuser company is the former owner of the marshfield plant weyerhaeuser is legally responsible for the conduct of roddis plywood corporation the former former owner and operator of the marshfield plant defendant m designed manufactured and sold masks for personal breathing protection in occupational settings including the m 0 mask defendant metropolitan life insurance company allegedly conspired to conceal information about the health hazards of asbestos from both individual endusers and industry finally defendant owensillinois sold licenses for a patent to manufacture fireproof doors which in practice incorporated asbestos containing cores owensillinois also manufactured sold and designed asbestos products including a fireproof door core under the brand name “kaylo” b exposure to airborne asbestos fibers plaintiffs allege that milton boyer “inhaled airborne asbestos fibers released during operations at the marshfield plant as a result of the following”  the court assumes the following facts as alleged viewed in a light most favorable and conceding all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs see adkins v vim recycling inc  fd   th cir 0  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  a his employment at the marshfield plant beginning in or around  b asbestos fibers contaminating the home auto lunchroom and other locations where nonwork related activities were performed c asbestos fibers released from the marshfield plant operations which contaminated the surrounding community and d transport of asbestos fibers from the marshfield plant to other locations st am compl dkt  ¶  plaintiffs allege that as a result of these exposures milton boyer “suffered from the asbestos related disease malignant mesothelioma” id at ¶  in pleading negligent and intentional nuisance claims against defendant weyerhaeuser in particular plaintiffs further allege that weyerhaeuser during operations to manufacture fire doors at the marshfield plant beginning on the 0s caused asbestos fibers to be released and contaminate the air in various settings in which no work related activities were being conducted or the plaintiff was not engaged in worked related activities including without limitation a the community surrounding the plant b homes and vehicles c landfills and d activities on the premises which were not work related id at ¶  plaintiffs also allege that “the operations of weyerhaeuser’s marshfield plant caused dangerous asbestos fibers to be transported to areas more distant through various means including without limitation”  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  a worker clothing personal effects hair and skin which had been contaminated by asbestos fibers at the plant and b collecting removing hauling and dumping asbestos waste materials id at ¶  jurisdiction the court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to  usc §  plaintiffs milton and kathy boyer are citizens of wisconsin st am compl dkt  ¶  defendant weyerhaeuser company is incorporated in the state of washington with its principal place of business in washington id ex a dkt   defendant m company is incorporated in the state of delaware with its principal place of business in minnesota id defendant metropolitan life insurance company is incorporated in the state of delaware with its principal place of business in new york id finally defendant owensillinois inc is incorporated in the state of delaware with its principal place of business in ohio id in light of the extent of plaintiff milton boyer’s injuries the amount in controversy also exceeds  on the face of the amended complaint plaintiffs purport to name three other unnamed insurance companies as defendants the law is clear however that “because the existence of diversity jurisdiction cannot be determined without knowledge of every defendant’s place of citizenship ‘john doe’ defendants are not permitted in federal diversity suits” howell by goerdt v tribune entm’t co 0 fd   th cir  the court therefore will dismiss these unnamed defendants see id should  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  plaintiffs learn the name of these insurance companies in a timely fashion and wish to add them as defendants  assuming their addition would not destroy complete diversity  plaintiffs may seek leave from the court to amend their complaint i weyerhaeuser’s motion to dismiss opinion weyerhaeuser posits two bases for dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint first weyerhaeuser contends that plaintiff’s claims of negligent and intentional nuisance  the sole claims alleged against weyerhaeuser  are barred by the exclusivity provision of wisconsin’s workers’ compensation act “wca” wis stat § 00 second defendant contends that plaintiffs’ allegations fail to meet the requirement of federal rule of civil procedure  because the court finds that plaintiffs’ claims are barred by the wca the court need not reach the second basis for dismissal a overview of wisconsin’s workers compensation act wisconsin statute § 00 defines employer liability where the following applicable “conditions” occur a where the employee sustains an injury b where at the time of the injury both the employer and employee are subject to the provisions of this chapter  plaintiffs also seek punitive damages count viii against all defendants but those damages are not available absent liability for an underlying tort see eg capital times co v doyle 0 wi app  ¶   wis d  0 nwd  explaining that under wisconsin law punitive damages are only available based on proof of underlying cause of action and actual damages  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  c where at the time of the injury the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment  any employee going to and from his or her employment in the ordinary and usual way while on the premises of the employer or while in the immediate vicinity of those premises if the injury results from an occurrence on the premises       e where the accident or disease causing injury arises out of the employee’s employment    subsection  of the same statute provides that “where such conditions exist the right to the recovery of compensation under this chapter shall be the exclusive remedy against the employer any other employee of the same employer and the workers compensation insurance carrier” wis stat § 00 emphasis added because it was the parties’ focus in briefing weyerhaeuser’s motion to dismiss the court will also focus on the requirements that  “the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment” under § 00c and  “the accident or disease causing injury arises out of the employee’s employment” § 00e see johnson v hondo inc  fd   th cir  “in order for employer liability under the worker’s compensation act to be triggered the injured employee at the time of injury had to have been ‘performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment’ and ‘the accident or disease causing injury must have arisen out of the employment’” citing weiss v city of milwaukee  wis d  0  nwd     case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  b analysis anticipating plaintiffs’ response defendant’s opening brief focused on the “dual persona” exception to the wca exclusivity provision def’s opening br dkt   discussing henning v gen motors assembly  nwd   wis  in their opposition brief however plaintiffs contend that the wca does not govern plaintiffs’ injuries because the injury was not sustained while plaintiff was “performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment” and because “plaintiff’s community exposures and takehome exposures do not as a matter of law    arise from the ‘course of employment’” pls’ opp’n dkt   with respect to whether boyer’s injury was sustained while he was performing service growing out of and incidental to his employment this requirement is easily met by the facts as plead as the wisconsin supreme court explained in weiss  wis d at 0  nwd at  performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment is used interchangeably with the phrase course of employment both phrases refer to the time place and circumstances under which the injury occurred an injury is said to arise in the course of the employment when it takes place within the period of the employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be and while he or she is fulfilling his or her duties or engaged in doing something incidental thereto internal citations and quotation marks omitted alterations in original see also goranson v dep’t of industry labor  human relations  wis d    nwd 0  0 “the phrase    ‘course of employment’ refers to the time place and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment”  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  here the alleged cause of injury is exposure to asbestos fibers plaintiffs assert in their opposition brief that the alleged “exposures occurred during plaintiff’s activities outside the workplace” pls’ opp’n dkt   but the allegations in the complaint  at least some of them  directly contradict that assertion see eg st am compl dkt  ¶  “plaintiff inhaled airborne asbestos fibers released during operations at the marshfield plant as a result of    his employment at the marshfield in or around ” although plaintiffs also allege that boyer was exposed to asbestos through “asbestos fibers contaminating the home auto lunchroom and other locations” the facts as alleged lead to the inescapable conclusion that this exposure was due in substantial part to boyer’s actions at work eg cutting asbestos cleaning up asbestos fibers etc which he then transported in his hair skin and clothing to other parts of the plant areas immediately surrounding work his car home and other places where he regularly spent time the requirement that the injury must arise out of the employment is also easily met to arise out of employment the injury need not be “caused by the employment” although plaintiff’s allegations arguably meet that higher burden rather “an accident arises out of employment when by reason of employment the employee is present at a place where he is injured through the agency of a third person an outside force or the conditions of the location constituting a zone of special danger” cutlerhammer inc v indus comm’n  wis d    nwd    see also weiss  wis d at 0  nwd at  “the ‘arising out of’ language of § 00e refers to  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  the causal origin of an employee’s injury” citing goranson  wis d at   nwd at  so too here admittedly sometimes the “arises out of” requirement may diverge from the “performing services” requirement see eg goranson  wis d at 0   nwd at   holding that driver was in course of employment at time of injury but the accident did not arise out of his employment because “the injuring force was purely personal to him” here however the injury  exposure to asbestos fibers  arose out of boyer’s employment because of certain “conditions of the location constituting a zone of special danger” as explained above while exposure may have extended beyond the workplace due to fibers on clothing in cars at home and elsewhere the injury still “arose out of his employment” indeed although not the focus of the parties another provision of the workers’ compensation act expressly states as much “any accident or disease arising out of a hazard of such service shall be deemed to arise out of the employee’s employment” wis stat § 00f see also consol papers inc v dep’t of indus labor  human relations  wis d 0   nwd    recognizing that “occupational diseases” arise out of employment still to avoid this seemingly inevitable holding plaintiffs attempt to draw an analogy to situations where an employee is injured while laundering his uniform at home or in an accident commuting from his home to his place of employment pls’ opp’n dkt   however the injured individuals in those situations were not performing employment services by doing laundry at home or even driving to work see eg mcrae v porta painting inc 00 wi app  ¶  0 wis d   nwd  “the  case cvwmc document   filed  page 0 of  typical employee going to or from work is not covered until he or she reaches the employers premises an employee going to work is ordinarily in the prosecution of his or her own business not performing services incidental to employment” internal citations and quotation marks omitted gibbs steel co v indus comm’n  wis   0 nwd 0   rejecting workers’ compensation claim where injury was sustained slipping on a bath mat because sleeping and bathing are “requirements of ordinary life and not of any particular employment” this court’s finding that the alleged injury occurred while plaintiff was performing service of employment and arose out of that employment appears consistent with all case law examining this issue at least as identified by the parties for example in silkwood v kerrmcfee corp  fd  0th cir  rev’d on other grounds  us   the tenth circuit reversed the district court’s denial of defendant’s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict finding that oklahoma’s workers’ compensation act provided the exclusive remedy for injuries caused by exposure to radiation from plutonium found at plaintiff’s apartment where plaintiff was an employee of a nuclear fuel processing plant operated by defendants in so holding the court reviewed the evidence of plaintiff’s exposure to plutonium and found that “all the plutonium found in her body came from her working with and around plutonium” id at  the fact that her apartment  and in particular her bathroom kitchen and bedroom  was contaminated did not alter the court’s finding that the injury occurred in the course of her employment finding “a logical nexus between silkwood’s injury and her work” id at  0 case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  similarly in two state court cases involving tort claims premised on injury to employees caused by asbestos fibers remaining on clothing outside of the place of employment courts rejected these claims as barred by workers’ compensation laws see acevedo v consolidated edison co of ny  add   ny app div  affirming trial court’s exclusion of tort claims premised on employee’s exposure to asbestos fibers remaining on clothing after they had returned home because “any damage resulting from such harm will clearly have arisen out of plaintiffs’ employment and is governed exclusively by the workers’ compensation law” swanson v simpson timer co no b 0 wl  at  cal ct app oct  0 unpublished finding socalled “secondary asbestos exposure” claim barred by the workers’ compensation act because  the injury “is derivative as it is depending upon the compensable injury arising from and in the course of and scope of swanson’s employment” and  “swanson’s secondary selfexposure from the asbestos fibers and dust on his works clothes would not have occurred if he were not exposed to asbestos in the course and scope of his employment” plaintiffs’ attempt to distinguish these cases is entirely unpersuasive while different states’ workers’ compensation laws govern the substantive provisions are similar to those in wis stat § 00 and similarly limit remedies to those available under the respective workers’ compensation laws see eg silkwood  fd at  describing “arising out of and in the court of employment” and “exclusive” liability provisions in okla stat ann tit  acevedo  add at 00 describing section  of new york’s wisconsin compensation law as providing the “sole and exclusive remedy of  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  any accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment” swanson 0 wl  at  describing california’s workers compensation act as covering injuries “arising out of and in the course of the employment” and limiting recovery to that system finally plaintiffs persist in arguing that inhalation of fibers did not occur until “after fibers are transported off the premises    during nonemployment activities such as laundering clothes other household activities in areas contaminated by asbestos fibers or riding in the car” pls’ opp’n dkt 0 this theory of liability is implausible given plaintiffs’ allegation that milton boyer was exposed to asbestos during his employment see bell atl corp v twombly 0 us   00 “factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the complaints allegations are true” because there is no way for plaintiffs to “unring” this bell by amendment the court will grant weyerhaeuser’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ causes of actions asserted against it and will dismiss weyerhaeuser from this action with prejudice see eg tamayo v blagojevich  fd 0  th cir 0 “a plaintiff pleads himself out of court when it would be necessary to contradict the complaint in order to prevail  to the extent plaintiffs rely on general allegations of asbestos exposure from landfills or in the air within the larger community  in other words exposure entirely unrelated to his employment  plaintiffs’ allegations do not meet the plausibility requirements of rule  for example the complaint contains no allegations that boyer lived near the plant or its transportation routes close to a landfill containing asbestos or ambient air with high asbestos content moreover the theory that milton boyer’s injury was caused by asbestos fibers entirely unrelated to his employment is not plausible given plaintiffs’ allegation that he was exposed to asbestos through and as a direct byproduct of his employment see bell atl 0 us at   case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  on the merits” edwards v snyder  fd  0 th cir 00 “a complaint can also allege too much a plaintiff may unwittingly plead himself out of court by alleging facts that preclude recovery” see also rohler v trw inc  fd 0  th cir  explaining that permission to amend may be refused if it is “apparent on the fact of plaintiff’s initial complaint” that “plaintiff cannot state a claim upon which relief can be granted” ii owensillinois’ motion to dismiss defendant owensillinois moves to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b while plaintiffs generally allege product liability claims against owensillinois sounding in negligence and strict liability st am compl dkt  counts i and ii the foundation for both claims is owens illinois’ role as licensor of a fireproof door patent id consistent with governing case law therefore owensillinois attached patent no 00 to its motion to dismiss which claims a fireproof door or panel comprising in part “a core of inorganic rigid fire proof light weight material of a substantially uniform apparent density and consistency throughout    ” oi’s mot to dismiss ex a dkt   the patent claims do not require asbestos as the core though asbestos is mentioned in the specification  “documents attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff’s complaint and are central to his claim” menominee indian tribe of wis v thompson  f d   th cir  internal citation and quotation marks omitted here plaintiffs refer to a patent and the patent is central to plaintiffs’ product liability claims asserted against owensillinois  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  a negligence a negligence products liability claim requires proof of four elements “ a duty of care on the part of the defendant  a breach of that duty  a causal connection between the conduct and the injury and  an actual loss or damage as a result of the injury” green v smith  nephew ahp inc 00 wi 0 ¶   wis d   nwd  quoting morden v cont’l ag  wi  ¶   wis d   nwd  the first element is “the obligation of due care to refrain from any act which will cause foreseeable harm to others” id whether there is a duty of care is a question of law for the court strasser v transtech mobile fleet serv inc  wisd    nwd    “the existence of a duty presents a question of law” accordingly plaintiffs’ negligence claim turns on whether the licensing of a patent which claims a fireproof door and specifies use of asbestos at its core “foreseeably creates an unreasonable risk to others” bittner v am honda motor co inc  wis d    nwd   as a matter of law the court concludes that plaintiffs cannot state a negligence claim based only on a party’s licensing of a technology even if used by the licensee to create a product containing asbestos this conclusion is consistent with a line of cases rejecting similar product liability claims premised on the licensing of a patent alone see eg in re celotex corp  fd 0  th cir 00 rejecting products liability claim based on defendant being nothing “more than a mere licensor” of a patent concerning “a variety of formulation of insulation some that do not contain asbestos and some that do” smith v wyeth inc  fd 0  th cir 0 holding consistent with its view of the majority of  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  courts addressing this issue that “manufacturer of a namebrand drug has no duty to patients who ingested only a generic version of the drug manufactured by the name brand drug companys competitors” in response plaintiffs cite to dolin v smithkline beecham corp no  c 0  wl 0 at  nd ill feb   for support while the district court rejected the majority review in that case denying summary judgment to defendant despite being the licensor of a patent it did so based on the defendant’s role in drafting the design and language of the warning label as such the defendant’s conduct extended beyond mere licensing of a patent plaintiffs would also make much of the fact that wisconsin courts adopted the minority opinion in palsgraf v long island rr co  ne  0 ny  including that “everyone owes to the world at large the duty of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others” hornback v archdiocese of milwaukee 0 wi  ¶   wis d   nwd  in contrast the majority view limited the duty to the “particular victim” whose risk is foreseeable id whatever the import of that distinction generally however it is immaterial to plaintiffs’ claim here whether owed to others at large or particular victims the duty still turns on the foreseeability of risk and courts have repeatedly dismissed negligence claims because the injury was not foreseeable to a defendant who played no role in the manufacturing marketing or use of the product see eg geboy v trl inc  fd   th cir  rejecting negligence claim brought under wisconsin law against a “party who is in the chain of distribution but have never assembled inspected nor used the product” rolph v ebi cos  wis d    case cvwmc document   filed  page  of   nwd   rejecting negligence claim against reconditioner for failing to correct design defects created by manufacturers pelnar v rosen sys inc  f supp   ed wis  rejecting negligence claim on public policy grounds asserted against an auction company b strict liability plaintiffs’ strict liability claim against owensillinois is similarly flawed to impose strict liability under wisconsin law the defendant must be “engaged in the business” of selling the alleged defective product geboy v trl inc  fd   th cir  see also st clare hosp of monroe wis v schmidt garden erickson inc  wis d 0   nwd   ct app  strict liability “is imposed only on manufacturers distributors and sellers  those who place or maintain the product in the stream of commerce” in geboy the seventh circuit rejected a strict liability claim against the broker of used products explaining that “the application of strict liability in tort is premised on certain public policy considerations which assumes that the manufacturerseller is in the paramount position to distribute the costs of the risks created by the defective product he is selling” id see also green v smith  nephew ahp inc 00 wi 0 ¶   wis d   nwd  the focus of a strict liability claim in contrast to a negligence claim is “not on the defendant’s conduct but on the nature of the defendant’s product” as alleged owensillinois is not a “seller” and there is no “product” sold by owensillinois while plaintiffs also allege that owensillinois “manufactured sold and  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of  designed asbestos products including without limitation fire door cores” referred to by the brand name “kaylo” st am compl dkt  ¶  plaintiffs fail to allege that boyer’s former employer purchased or otherwise used owensillinois’ kaylo door cores in manufacturing its fireproof doors absent such an allegation plaintiffs do not state a viable strict liability claim premised on the manufacturing and selling of kaylo door cores against owensillinois under wisconsin law however on the unlikely chance plaintiffs can allege that owensillinois sold kaylo door cores to boyer’s former employer for use during his employ the court will grant plaintiffs 0 days to file an amended complaint it is ordered that order  defendant weyerhaeuser company’s motion to dismiss dkt  is granted count iii and iv of plaintiffs’ first amended complaint are dismissed with prejudice and defendant weyerhaeuser is dismissed from this action  defendant owensillinois inc’s motion to dismiss dkt  is granted counts i and ii of plaintiffs’ first amended complaint premised on owens illinois’s role as a licensor are dismissed with prejudice  plaintiff may have until september   to file an amended complaint alleging specific facts necessary to state a claim for strict liability against owensillinois provided they can do so in good faith and  while outside the purview of a motion to dismiss owensillinois represents that it was out of the business of manufacturing door cores more than a decade before boyer’s exposure to asbestos alleged in this action owensillinois’s reply dkt   as a result it appears that plaintiffs cannot in good faith make such an allegation  case cvwmc document   filed  page  of   defendant owensillinois’s motion for relief under wis stat § 00 dkt  is denied as moot entered

metropolitan life insurance company and owensillinois inc defendants plaintiffs milton and kathy boyer bring claims against defendants arising out of milton s exposure to asbestos and a related disease malignant mesothelioma before the court are two motions to dismiss in the first motion defendant weyerhaeuser company the former owner of a door manufacturing plant where milton boyer worked and asbestos fireproofing products were produced moves to dismiss the claims brought against it as barred by wisconsin s workers compensation act dkt  in the second motion defendant owensillinois company seeks dismissal of product liability claims premised solely on its licensing of a patent claiming a fireproof door dkt  for the reasons that follow the court will grant both motions and dismiss weyerhaeuser and owensillinois as defendants  owensillinois also filed a motion to order plaintiffs compliance with wis stat § 00 a new state statute requiring disclosure of asbestos trust claims among other provisions dkt  because the court grants owensillinois motion to dismiss it need not reach the merits of this motion and accordingly will deny it as moot allegations of fact a the parties plaintiff milton boyer previously was employed at a door manufacturing plant in marshfield wisconsin where asbestos fireproofing products were manufactured and products containing asbestos were used in the manufacturing process plaintiff kathy boyer is his wife defendant weyerhaeuser company is the former owner of the marshfield plant weyerhaeuser is legally responsible for the conduct of roddis plywood corporation the former former owner and operator of the marshfield plant defendant m designed manufactured and sold masks for personal breathing protection in occupational settings including the m 0 mask defendant metropolitan life insurance company allegedly conspired to conceal information about the health hazards of asbestos from both individual endusers and industry finally defendant owensillinois sold licenses for a patent to manufacture fireproof doors which in practice incorporated asbestoscontaining cores owensillinois also manufactured sold and designed asbestos products including a fireproof door core under the brand name kaylo b exposure to airborne asbestos fibers plaintiffs allege that milton boyer inhaled airborne asbestos fibers released during operations at the marshfield plant as a result of the following  the court assumes the following facts as alleged viewed in a light most favorable and conceding all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs see adkins v vim recycling inc  fd   th cir 0  a his employment at the marshfield plant beginning in or around  b asbestos fibers contaminating the home auto lunchroom and other locations where nonwork related activities were performed c asbestos fibers released from the marshfield plant operations which contaminated the surrounding community and d transport of asbestos fibers from the marshfield plant to other locations st am compl dkt  ¶  plaintiffs allege that as a result of these exposures milton boyer suffered from the asbestos related disease malignant mesothelioma id at ¶  in pleading negligent and intentional nuisance claims against defendant weyerhaeuser in particular plaintiffs further allege that weyerhaeuser during operations to manufacture fire doors at the marshfield plant beginning on the 0s caused asbestos fibers to be released and contaminate the air in various settings in which no work related activities were being conducted or the plaintiff was not engaged in worked related activities including without limitation a the community surrounding the plant b homes and vehicles c landfills and d activities on the premises which were not work related id at ¶  plaintiffs also allege that the operations of weyerhaeuser s marshfield plant caused dangerous asbestos fibers to be transported to areas more distant through various means including without limitation  a worker clothing personal effects hair and skin which had been contaminated by asbestos fibers at the plant and b collecting removing hauling and dumping asbestos waste materials id at ¶  jurisdiction the court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to  usc §  plaintiffs milton and kathy boyer are citizens of wisconsin st am compl dkt  ¶  defendant weyerhaeuser company is incorporated in the state of washington with its principal place of business in washington id ex a dkt  defendant m company is incorporated in the state of delaware with its principal place of business in minnesota id defendant metropolitan life insurance company is incorporated in the state of delaware with its principal place of business in new york id finally defendant owensillinois inc is incorporated in the state of delaware with its principal place of business in ohio id in light of the extent of plaintiff milton boyer s injuries the amount in controversy also exceeds  on the face of the amended complaint plaintiffs purport to name three other unnamed insurance companies as defendants the law is clear however that because the existence of diversity jurisdiction cannot be determined without knowledge of every defendant s place of citizenship john doe defendants are not permitted in federal diversity suits howell by goerdt v tribune entm t co 0 fd   th cir  the court therefore will dismiss these unnamed defendants see id should  plaintiffs learn the name of these insurance companies in a timely fashion and wish to add them as defendants  assuming their addition would not destroy complete diversity  plaintiffs may seek leave from the court to amend their complaint opinion i weyerhaeuser s motion to dismiss weyerhaeuser posits two bases for dismissing plaintiffs complaint first weyerhaeuser contends that plaintiff s claims of negligent and intentional nuisance  the sole claims alleged against weyerhaeuser  are barred by the exclusivity provision of wisconsin s workers compensation act  wca  wis stat § 00 second defendant contends that plaintiffs allegations fail to meet the requirement of federal rule of civil procedure  because the court finds that plaintiffs claims are barred by the wca the court need not reach the second basis for dismissal a overview of wisconsin s workers compensation act wisconsin statute § 00 defines employer liability where the following applicable conditions occur a where the employee sustains an injury b where at the time of the injury both the employer and employee are subject to the provisions of this chapter  plaintiffs also seek punitive damages count viii against all defendants but those damages are not available absent liability for an underlying tort see eg capital times co v doyle 0 wi app  ¶   wis d  0 nwd  explaining that under wisconsin law punitive damages are only available based on proof of underlying cause of action and actual damages  c where at the time of the injury the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment  any employee going to and from his or her employment in the ordinary and usual way while on the premises of the employer or while in the immediate vicinity of those premises if the injury results from an occurrence on the premises     e where the accident or disease causing injury arises out of the employee s employment  subsection  of the same statute provides that where such conditions exist the right to the recovery of compensation under this chapter shall be the exclusive remedy against the employer any other employee of the same employer and the workers compensation insurance carrier wis stat § 00 emphasis added because it was the parties focus in briefing weyerhaeuser s motion to dismiss the court will also focus on the requirements that  the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment under § 00c and  the accident or disease causing injury arises out of the employee s employment § 00e see johnson v hondo inc  fd   th cir   in order for employer liability under the worker s compensation act to be triggered the injured employee at the time of injury had to have been performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and the accident or disease causing injury must have arisen out of the employment  citing weiss v city of milwaukee  wis d  0  nwd     b analysis anticipating plaintiffs response defendant s opening brief focused on the dual persona exception to the wca exclusivity provision def s opening br dkt   discussing henning v gen motors assembly  nwd   wis  in their opposition brief however plaintiffs contend that the wca does not govern plaintiffs injuries because the injury was not sustained while plaintiff was performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and because plaintiff s community exposures and takehome exposures do not as a matter of law    arise from the course of employment pls opp n dkt   with respect to whether boyer s injury was sustained while he was performing service growing out of and incidental to his employment this requirement is easily met by the facts as plead as the wisconsin supreme court explained in weiss  wis d at 0  nwd at  performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment is used interchangeably with the phrase course of employment both phrases refer to the time place and circumstances under which the injury occurred an injury is said to arise in the course of the employment when it takes place within the period of the employment at a place where the employee reasonably may be and while he or she is fulfilling his or her duties or engaged in doing something incidental thereto internal citations and quotation marks omitted alterations in original see also goranson v dep t of industry labor  human relations  wis d    nwd 0  0  the phrase    course of employment refers to the time place and circumstances of the accident in relation to the employment   here the alleged cause of injury is exposure to asbestos fibers plaintiffs assert in their opposition brief that the alleged exposures occurred during plaintiff s activities outside the workplace pls opp n dkt   but the allegations in the complaint at least some of them  directly contradict that assertion see eg st am compl dkt  ¶   plaintiff inhaled airborne asbestos fibers released during operations at the marshfield plant as a result of    his employment at the marshfield in or around   although plaintiffs also allege that boyer was exposed to asbestos through asbestos fibers contaminating the home auto lunchroom and other locations the facts as alleged lead to the inescapable conclusion that this exposure was due in substantial part to boyer s actions at work eg cutting asbestos cleaning up asbestos fibers etc which he then transported in his hair skin and clothing to other parts of the plant areas immediately surrounding work his car home and other places where he regularly spent time the requirement that the injury must arise out of the employment is also easily met to arise out of employment the injury need not be caused by the employment although plaintiff s allegations arguably meet that higher burden rather an accident arises out of employment when by reason of employment the employee is present at a place where he is injured through the agency of a third person an outside force or the conditions of the location constituting a zone of special danger cutlerhammer inc v indus comm n  wis d    nwd    see also weiss  wis d at 0  nwd at   the arising out of language of § 00e refers to  the causal origin of an employee s injury  citing goranson  wis d at   nwd at  so too here admittedly sometimes the arises out of requirement may diverge from the performing services requirement see eg goranson  wis d at 0   nwd at   holding that driver was in course of employment at time of injury but the accident did not arise out of his employment because the injuring force was purely personal to him  here however the injury  exposure to asbestos fibers  arose out of boyer s employment because of certain conditions of the location constituting a zone of special danger as explained above while exposure may have extended beyond the workplace due to fibers on clothing in cars at home and elsewhere the injury still arose out of his employment indeed although not the focus of the parties another provision of the workers compensation act expressly states as much any accident or disease arising out of a hazard of such service shall be deemed to arise out of the employee s employment wis stat § 00f see also consol papers inc v dep t of indus labor  human relations  wis d 0   nwd    recognizing that occupational diseases arise out of employment still to avoid this seemingly inevitable holding plaintiffs attempt to draw an analogy to situations where an employee is injured while laundering his uniform at home or in an accident commuting from his home to his place of employment pls opp n dkt   however the injured individuals in those situations were not performing employment services by doing laundry at home or even driving to work see eg mcrae v porta painting inc 00 wi app  ¶  0 wis d   nwd   the  typical employee going to or from work is not covered until he or she reaches the employers premises an employee going to work is ordinarily in the prosecution of his or her own business not performing services incidental to employment  internal citations and quotation marks omitted gibbs steel co v indus comm n  wis   0 nwd 0   rejecting workers compensation claim where injury was sustained slipping on a bath mat because sleeping and bathing are requirements of ordinary life and not of any particular employment  this court s finding that the alleged injury occurred while plaintiff was performing service of employment and arose out of that employment appears consistent with all case law examining this issue at least as identified by the parties for example in silkwood v kerrmcfee corp  fd  0th cir  rev d on other grounds  us   the tenth circuit reversed the district court s denial of defendant s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict finding that oklahoma s workers compensation act provided the exclusive remedy for injuries caused by exposure to radiation from plutonium found at plaintiff s apartment where plaintiff was an employee of a nuclear fuel processing plant operated by defendants in so holding the court reviewed the evidence of plaintiff s exposure to plutonium and found that all the plutonium found in her body came from her working with and around plutonium id at  the fact that her apartment  and in particular her bathroom kitchen and bedroom  was contaminated did not alter the court s finding that the injury occurred in the course of her employment finding a logical nexus between silkwood s injury and her work id at  0 similarly in two state court cases involving tort claims premised on injury to employees caused by asbestos fibers remaining on clothing outside of the place of employment courts rejected these claims as barred by workers compensation laws see acevedo v consolidated edison co of ny  add   ny app div  affirming trial court s exclusion of tort claims premised on employee s exposure to asbestos fibers remaining on clothing after they had returned home because any damage resulting from such harm will clearly have arisen out of plaintiffs employment and is governed exclusively by the workers compensation law  swanson v simpson timer co no b 0 wl  at  cal ct app oct  0 unpublished finding socalled secondary asbestos exposure claim barred by the workers compensation act because  the injury is derivative as it is depending upon the compensable injury arising from and in the course of and scope of swanson s employment and  swanson s secondary selfexposure from the asbestos fibers and dust on his works clothes would not have occurred if he were not exposed to asbestos in the course and scope of his employment  plaintiffs attempt to distinguish these cases is entirely unpersuasive while different states workers compensation laws govern the substantive provisions are similar to those in wis stat § 00 and similarly limit remedies to those available under the respective workers compensation laws see eg silkwood  fd at  describing arising out of and in the court of employment and exclusive liability provisions in okla stat ann tit  acevedo  add at 00 describing section  of new york s wisconsin compensation law as providing the sole and exclusive remedy of  any accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment  swanson 0 wl  at  describing california s workers compensation act as covering injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment and limiting recovery to that system finally plaintiffs persist in arguing that inhalation of fibers did not occur until after fibers are transported off the premises    during nonemployment activities such as laundering clothes other household activities in areas contaminated by asbestos fibers or riding in the car pls opp n dkt 0 this theory of liability is implausible given plaintiffs allegation that milton boyer was exposed to asbestos during his employment see bell atl corp v twombly 0 us   00  factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level on the assumption that all of the complaints allegations are true  because there is no way for plaintiffs to unring this bell by amendment the court will grant weyerhaeuser s motion to dismiss plaintiffs causes of actions asserted against it and will dismiss weyerhaeuser from this action with prejudice see eg tamayo v blagojevich  fd 0  th cir 0  a plaintiff pleads himself out of court when it would be necessary to contradict the complaint in order to prevail to the extent plaintiffs rely on general allegations of asbestos exposure from landfills or in the air within the larger community  in other words exposure entirely unrelated to his employment  plaintiffs allegations do not meet the plausibility requirements of rule  for example the complaint contains no allegations that boyer lived near the plant or its transportation routes close to a landfill containing asbestos or ambient air with high asbestos content moreover the theory that milton boyer s injury was caused by asbestos fibers entirely unrelated to his employment is not plausible given plaintiffs allegation that he was exposed to asbestos through and as a direct byproduct of his employment see bell atl 0 us at    on the merits  edwards v snyder  fd  0 th cir 00  a complaint can also allege too much a plaintiff may unwittingly plead himself out of court by alleging facts that preclude recovery  see also rohler v trw inc  fd 0  th cir  explaining that permission

defendant owensillinois moves to dismiss plaintiffs claims for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b while plaintiffs generally allege product liability claims against owensillinois sounding in negligence and strict liability st am compl dkt  counts i and ii the foundation for both claims is owensillinois role as licensor of a fireproof door patent id consistent

weight material of a substantially uniform apparent density and consistency throughout     oi s mot to dismiss ex a dkt   the patent claims do not require asbestos as the core though asbestos is mentioned in the specification  documents attached to a motion to dismiss are considered part of the pleadings if they are referred to in the plaintiff s complaint and are central to his claim menominee indian tribe of wis v thompson  f d   th cir  internal citation and quotation marks omitted here plaintiffs refer to a patent and the patent is central to plaintiffs product liability claims asserted against owensillinois  a negligence a negligence products liability claim requires proof of four elements  a duty of care on the part of the defendant  a breach of that duty  a causal connection between the conduct and the injury and  an actual loss or damage as a result of the injury green v smith  nephew ahp inc 00 wi 0 ¶   wis d   nwd  quoting morden v cont l ag  wi  ¶   wis d   nwd  the first element is the obligation of due care to refrain from any act which will cause foreseeable harm to others id whether there is a duty of care is a question of law for the court strasser v transtech mobile fleet serv inc  wisd    nwd     the existence of a duty presents a question of law  accordingly plaintiffs negligence claim turns on whether the licensing of a patent which claims a fireproof door and specifies use of asbestos at its core foreseeably creates an unreasonable risk to others bittner v am honda motor co inc  wis d    nwd   as a matter of law the court concludes that plaintiffs cannot state a negligence claim based only on a party s licensing of a technology even if used by the licensee to create a product containing asbestos this conclusion is consistent with a line of cases rejecting similar product liability claims premised on the licensing of a patent alone see eg in re celotex corp  fd 0  th cir 00 rejecting products liability claim based on defendant being nothing more than a mere licensor of a patent concerning a variety of formulation of insulation some that do not contain asbestos and some that do  smith v wyeth inc  fd 0  th cir 0 holding consistent with its view of the majority of  courts addressing this issue that manufacturer of a namebrand drug has no duty to patients who ingested only a generic version of the drug manufactured by the namebrand drug companys competitors  in response plaintiffs cite to dolin v smithkline beecham corp no  c 0  wl 0 at  nd ill feb   for support while the district court rejected the majority review in that case denying summary judgment to defendant despite being the licensor of a patent it did so based on the defendant s role in drafting the design and language of the warning label as such the defendant s conduct extended beyond mere licensing of a patent plaintiffs would also make much of the fact that wisconsin courts adopted the minority opinion in palsgraf v long island rr co  ne  0 ny  including that everyone owes to the world at large the duty of refraining from those acts that may unreasonably threaten the safety of others hornback v archdiocese of milwaukee 0 wi  ¶   wis d   nwd  in contrast the majority view limited the duty to the particular victim whose risk is foreseeable id whatever the import of that distinction generally however it is immaterial to plaintiffs claim here whether owed to others at large or particular victims the duty still turns on the foreseeability of risk and courts have repeatedly dismissed negligence claims because the injury was not foreseeable to a defendant who played no role in the manufacturing marketing or use of the product see eg geboy v trl inc  fd   th cir  rejecting negligence claim brought under wisconsin law against a party who is in the chain of distribution but have never assembled inspected nor used the product  rolph v ebi cos  wis d    nwd   rejecting negligence claim against reconditioner for failing to correct design defects created by manufacturers pelnar v rosen sys inc  f supp   ed wis  rejecting negligence claim on public policy grounds asserted against an auction company b strict liability plaintiffs strict liability claim against owensillinois is similarly flawed to impose strict liability under wisconsin law the defendant must be engaged in the business of selling the alleged defective product geboy v trl inc  fd   th cir  see also st clare hosp of monroe wis v schmidt garden erickson inc  wis d 0   nwd   ct app  strict liability is imposed only on manufacturers distributors and sellers  those who place or maintain the product in the stream of commerce  in geboy the seventh circuit rejected a strict liability claim against the broker of used products explaining that the application of strict liability in tort is premised on certain public policy considerations which assumes that the manufacturerseller is in the paramount position to distribute the costs of the risks created by the defective product he is selling id see also green v smith  nephew ahp inc 00 wi 0 ¶   wis d   nwd  the focus of a strict liability claim in contrast to a negligence claim is not on the defendant s conduct but on the nature of the defendant s product  as alleged owensillinois is not a seller and there is no product sold by owensillinois while plaintiffs also allege that owensillinois manufactured sold and  designed asbestos products including without limitation fire door cores referred to by the brand name kaylo st am compl dkt  ¶  plaintiffs fail to allege that boyer s former employer purchased or otherwise used owensillinois kaylo door cores in manufacturing its fireproof doors absent such an allegation plaintiffs do not state a viable strict liability claim premised on the manufacturing and selling of kaylo door cores against owensillinois under wisconsin law however on the unlikely chance plaintiffs can allege that owensillinois sold kaylo door cores to boyer s former employer for use during his employ the court will grant plaintiffs 0 days to file an amended complaint order it is ordered that  defendant weyerhaeuser company s motion to dismiss dkt  is granted count iii and iv of plaintiffs first amended complaint are dismissed with prejudice and defendant weyerhaeuser is dismissed from this action  defendant owensillinois inc s motion to dismiss dkt  is granted counts i and ii of plaintiffs first amended complaint premised on owensillinois s role as a licensor are dismissed with prejudice  plaintiff may have until september   to file an amended complaint alleging specific facts necessary to state a claim for strict liability against owensillinois provided they can do so in good faith and  while outside the purview of a motion to dismiss owensillinois represents that it was out of the business of manufacturing door cores more than a decade before boyer s exposure to asbestos alleged in this action owensillinois s reply dkt
