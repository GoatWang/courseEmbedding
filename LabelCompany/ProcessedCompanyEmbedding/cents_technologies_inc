policy navigation menu home » led lights led lights   the emergence of leds as a useful alternative to incandescent lighting can be credited to new manufacturing technologies along with a growing awareness of the advantages of leds   led lighting offers some key advantages when compared to the oldfashioned incandescent light bulb invented by thomas edison reduced energy use reduced heat generation increased life expectancy lightemitting diodes supply a lowenergy source of lighting led fixtures used for lighting as opposed to those used to create a glowing effect on signs and equipment include numerous leds that together create white light that illuminates an area effectively  led lights hold a number of advantages in comparison to compact fluorescent light bulbs or cfls the coiled bulbs that have replaced many traditional incandescent light bulbs   the energysaving capacity of led lights means they’re better for the environment than traditional forms of lighting keep energy bills lower leds last for a long time typically far longer than fluorescent bulbs furthermore leds are durable not breaking as easily as bulbs the ability of leds to direct light in a specific direction is one of their primary benefits while cfls emit light in all directions  cfl bulbs often fall short of their expected lifespans led lights typically come with at least threeyear warranties according to the epa   use our energy saving led tubes as a retrofit or new installation led lights can be easily installed just like conventional lighting as an example led t’s fit existing sockets with just a slight wiring modification led fluorescent light replacements offer bright light low heat with the cost saving and many have a feature of no ballast required   a wide variety of leds
