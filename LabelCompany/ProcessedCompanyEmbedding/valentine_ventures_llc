questions faqs what happens if i want to end the relationship contractually either party the client or the firm can terminate by providing a written notice to the other days in advance however valentine ventures typically waives the day advance notice period if a client requests a termination aside from a final billing based on a prorated amount of accrued management fees there are no other charges or restrictions on the funds being released from the firm’s control what are the total expenses involved with the relationship valentine ventures’ sole compensation are the fees it charges as described elsewhere on this site in addition the client pays trade commission on some but not all of the investments in their portfolio typically  per equity trade and reasonable amounts on bond trades the firm will often use exchange traded funds etfs each of which reduce their value by an operating expense ratio oer–however the oer on etfs is famously low compared to mutual funds what kind of return can i expect anyone that answers this question with a numberpercentage or a range of numberspercentages is either a fool or a charlatan or both valentine ventures devotes its entire energy to maximizing returns within the risk constraints unique to each of its clients the overall investment environment during the term of the relationship will determine the vast majority of the return and that cannot be predicted nor avoided the foremost goal is to establish a reasonable financial plan and then execute it with the most appropriate investment mix what’s to prevent valentine ventures from stealing all our money for starters we don’t have access to your money—by design your accounts are held by an independent custodian and brokerage firm charles schwab  co inc our firm is afforded by you a limited power of attorney that allows us to trade the account receive information about the account move money to you for you and bill the account for management fees we cannot distribute your funds to our firmultimately because of the importance we assign to our role as your fiduciary we abide by a code of ethics as mandated by the advisors act of  and hold ourselves to the highest level of integrity and compliance of all laws and regulations how is the minimum account size requirement for wealth management calculated it is the sum of the accounts that will be under our care for example two accounts of  within one household meet the standard excluded from the calculation are accounts that we cannot manage using our investments such as college  plans and most ks some “self directed” ks that avail the participant of the assignment to an investment adviser will count toward the minimum as we’ll be managing it like all other accounts if a client has  among “manageable” accounts valentine ventures will offer its advice on the best allocation among choices for all accounts it does not manage like s and ks once the threshold is met we will generally invite in immediate family members who may not on their own meet the minimum do i have to turn all my investments over to valentine ventures no as long as the combined values of all accounts under direct management equal  or more by household see prior point above the minimum requirement to form a relationship is met—there is no requirement to release all investment funds to valentine ventures does a client have to sell all their investments to become a client no occasionally longheld securities will have material unrealized taxable gains embedded in them we balance the liquidation of these issues with the risks associated with holding them and in consideration of the tax impact additionally if a client holds a “sacred cow” dearly held issue there is no requirement to part with it at times it may even be desirable to split an account into two to allow us to manage a portion while the client manages the other if that’s of interest to them do i get to approve the investments before they’re added to my portfolio yes and no before a portfolio is constructed the client is fully aware of what the construction of the portfolio will entail and they will have approved of the asset allocation targets via the investment policy statement however as investments are bought and sold clients are not consulted as to their opinion of the desirability of the transaction that type of collaborative relationship exists within a retail brokerage arrangement but not a discretionary investment management relationship all investments and their trade confirmations are available for client observation shortly after transactions occur clients have full viewing access to their account online  hours a day via the charles schwab website additionally the performance of all investments individually and collectively is communicated to clients at quarterend the firm goes to great lengths to communicate its ongoing investment strategy throughout the year what happens to the firm if something happens to mr valentine at the current time a contingency plan exists in the event that mr valentine is unable to manage the firm that allows for an orderly shut down of the company in that event clients would be notified and assisted in the transition to a new firm of their choosing if needed eventually the firm will have the infrastructure resources procedures and processes in place necessary to ensure its survivability without the role of any one member of the firm including its founder has valentine ventures ever been accused of any violation of the law or its fiduciary duty to clients no valentine ventures has not been accused of any violation of the law or its fiduciary duty to clients and is not aware of any such accusations pending the members of the firm abide by a code of ethics as mandated by the advisors act of  and the firm holds itself to the highest level of integrity and compliance with all laws and regulations as a registered investment adviser the company is held to the “fiduciary standard” obliging it to act solely in the client’s interest is valentine ventures the right firm for everyone while we’d like to say that we’re right for everyone we’re not we are ideally suited for individuals that would like to deliberately plan for financial independence or the maintenance of said independence if it’s already been achieved and who understand their own limitations in managing the assets that assist them in that regard our clients trust the financial planning process and its output and are comfortable delegating the authority for investing because they lack the time

riskbased investment management valentine ventures lives by one simple rule  don’t take on more risk than you need to  the complexities of financial markets as well as human emotions can drive

see examples below our modeling software analyzes your optimal portfolio allocation while assuming the least amount of risk necessary to achieve your objectives given the constraints specific to your personal situation within the investment portfolio we endeavor to reduce risk through broad allocations to lowcorrelating investment classes we invest across at least eight different asset classes and rebalance periodically in an effort to smooth the overall return profile and reduce the effects of negative performance of any one class our proprietary portfolio structure includes the following asset classes us stocks foreign stocks us bonds foreign bonds real estate commodities volatility other alternative classes portfolio construction valentine ventures embraces the use of exchange traded funds etfs in client portfolios  etfs are now recognized as the ideal lowcost diversified and liquid way to access global asset markets of all kinds for asset protection and income production valentine ventures structures a broad bond portfolio based on highquality individual bonds and similar instruments  the portfolio limits risk at several levels bonds are “laddered” by maturity to reduce “interest rate risk” inflationprotection bonds are used to hedge against “inflation risk” and only toprated bonds are used to reduce “credit risk” smaller accounts will use bond etfs in place of individual bonds due to the constraints of constructing a ladder with less funds the investment portfolio’s overall sensitivity to changes in the market or beta is controlled so as to reduce
