is focused on significantly improving surgery and enabling access to our products and services in pursuit of this mission globally the momentum built over the past several quarters continued into the second quarter of  with solid performance in procedures and strong growth in system placements growth in procedures for the quarter was  over the second quarter of  overall trends in the first quarter remained stable into the second starting with united states both the emerging category of general surgery and more mature categories in urology and gynecology performed well hernia repair continues to stand out in the general surgery category with additional contributions coming from colon procedures as we mentioned last quarter european performance in q of  benefited from calendar tailwinds that we expected to balance out in the second quarter indeed this occurred with core growth staying roughly steady through the first half of  and european second quarter growth moderating procedure performance in asia was solid with growth in china being a highlight from a constrained installed base patrick will take you through these factors in more detail later in the call our capital placement performance in q of  strengthened with the growth in total placements from  in q of  to  this quarter as we mentioned on these calls capital placements can be lumpy as evidenced by our performance in the first half of the year in the united states placements rebounded from a softer q to a strong q anchored in repeat purchases by existing customers and multi system placements system placements in europe grew moderately aided in part by the launch of da vinci x in asia the placements grew slightly over the prior year period and over last quarter constrained for the time being by the lack of a new system quota in china and limited reimbursements in japan marshall and patrick will take you through system placement dynamics in greater detail turning to profitability for the quarter strong system placements led to gross margins that are lower than last quarter these margins are at the top of our expected range because of the strength in procedures and improvements in our operating efficiencies our fixed cost growth met our expectations with increases in rd expenses growth in staff in european and asian markets investment in clinical trials and growth in our corporate computational capabilities our second quarter pro forma operating results were as follows procedures grew approximately  over the second quarter of last year we shipped  da vinci surgical systems up from  in the second quarter of  revenue for the quarter was  million up  from the prior year instrument and accessory revenue increased to  million up  total recurring revenue in the quarter was  million representing  of total revenue pro forma gross profit margin was  compared to  in the second quarter last year we generated a pro forma operating profit of  million in the quarter up  from the second quarter of last year and pro forma net income was  million up  from q of  marshall will take you through our finances in greater detail shortly turning to our product pipeline as you know in the back half of  and the first half of  we increased our mid term and longterm investments in creating our next generation of products and services we anchored on our belief that substantial opportunity exists to enable a more minimally invasive surgery better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally starting with our multiport portfolio we developed a system pathway that responds to our customer’s desire for choice in clinical capability and choice in total economics in the quarter weve received our ce mark and k clearance for da vinci x a system that brings core xi technology into a highly capable lower entry price surgical system were pleased with the early reception of x by our customers and the choice it brings to those around the world who seek to build robotic surgery programs with logical upgrade pathways and affordable access to our leading robot assisted surgery ecosystem our sp program continues progress in its human clinical trial work and pilot production capability we now have four clinical trial sites active three in the united states and one in asia cases in asia have included transoral urologic and colorectal surgery while those in the us are focused on transoral roboticassisted surgery as we mentioned in our last  in our call last quarter we anticipate filing our k for sp in urology in the back half of  surgeon feedback from our trial sites is very encouraging our teams continue to work on product validations and manufacturing capability to support submission and launch lastly our flexible robotics program is meeting our expectations and making good progress in its product design phases and definition of regulatory pathways in closing the second quarter of  has carried forward momentum built in prior quarters and we remain focused on the following for the balance of the year first continued adoption of da vinci in general surgery second continued development of european markets and access to customers in asia third advancing our new platforms imaging advanced instruments da vinci sp and flexible robotics progress and finally support for additional clinical and economic validation by region ill now turn the call over to marshall who will review financial highlights marshall mohr thank you gary i will describe our results on a nongaap or pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals excess tax benefits associated with employee stock awards and charges associated with stock based compensation and purchase ip we provide pro forma information because we believe the business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis i would also summarize our gaap results later in my script we have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our gaap results on our website so that there is no confusion second quarter  revenue was  million an increase of  compared with  million for the second quarter of  and an increase of  compared with the first quarter revenue of  million we launched the da vinci x system during the second quarter in the us and european countries covered by ce mark in conjunction with the launch we offered certain customers who purchased systems in the first quarter the opportunity to upgrade or trade out their systems for the x system as a result we deferred  million of first quarter revenue which we recognize when customers either trade out their systems or when the offers expire whichever comes first none of the deferred revenue was recognized in the second quarter we expect substantially all of the deferred revenue to be recognized by year end second quarter  procedures increased approximately  compared with the second quarter of  it increased  compared with last quarter procedure growth relative to last year and the first quarter has been driven by general surgery in the us and urology worldwide patrick will provide more detail concerning procedure adoptions revenue highlights are as follows instrument and accessory revenue of  million increased  compared with last year and increased  compared with the first quarter of  which closely reflects procedure growth instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure was approximately  per procedure compared with  last year and  last quarter the increase relative to the second quarter of  primarily reflects increased sales of our stapling and vessel sealing products partially offset by customer buying patterns the decrease compared with the previous quarter primarily reflects customer buying patterns system revenue of  million increased  compared with the second quarter of  and increased  compared with last quarter the yearoveryear increase reflects higher system placements and operating lease revenue partially offset by lower average selling prices and lower lease buyout revenue system revenue for the first quarter of  excluded the  million of deferred revenue had the first quarter included net revenue quarteroverquarter increase would have been  reflecting a higher number of system placements partially offset by lower lease buyout revenue  systems were placed in the second quarter of  compared with  systems in the second quarter of  and  systems last quarter  systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with  systems in the second quarter of  and  last quarter as a reminder revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease of the  second quarter systems  were x systems as of the end of the second quarter of  there were  systems out in the field under operating leases we generated approximately  million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with  million in the second quarter of  and approximately  million last quarter we generated approximately  million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with  million in the second quarter of  and  million last quarter globally our average selling price which excludes the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts and revenue deferrals was  million compared with  million last year and  million last quarter the decrease in asp compared to the second quarter of  primarily reflects lower priced system sold to cost sensitive market segments and lower pricing offered to customers purchasing multiple systems we believe the flexible financing programs like operating leases have positively impacted our ability to grow our installed base we expect a proportion of these types of arrangements would increase over time service revenue of  million increased  yearoveryear it increased approximately  compared with the first quarter of  the yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter increases reflect growth in our installed base with da vinci systems outside of the us results were as follows second quarter revenue outside of the us up  million increased  compared with  million for the second quarter of  it increased  compared with  million for the first quarter the increase relative to the prior year primarily reflects increased system placements net of leases and increased instruments and accessories reflecting procedure growth partially offset by lower system asps patrick will provide procedure growth information the yearoveryear decline in system asps reflects increased sales of lower cost systems to costsensitive markets the increase in revenue relative to the last quarter reflects increased system placements and increased instrument and accessory growth outside of the us we placed  systems in the second quarter compared with  in the second quarter of  and  last quarter  of the system placements in the current quarter were operating leases compared with two last quarter  last year and  last quarter current quarter system placements including  into europe  into japan  into india  into australia and  into china system placements outside of the us will continue to be lumpy as some of the ous markets are in early stages of adoption some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations moving on to the remainder of the pl the pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of  was  compared with  for the second quarter of  and  for the first quarter of  the decrease compared with the second quarter of  primarily reflects decreased service margin associated with higher scope repair costs the decrease compared with the first quarter reflects a higher proportion of system revenue relative to total revenue since we deferred costs associated with the  million revenue deferral the trade out program had little impact on our margin future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products the mix of systems and instrument and accessory revenue our ability to further reduce product costs and improve manufacturing efficiency and in the long term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax pro forma operating expenses increased  compared with the second quarter of  it increased  compared with last quarter the increases are consistent with our planned investments in product development specifically da vinci sp flexible robotics imaging and advanced instrumentation and the expansion of our ous markets the yearoveryear growth rates will subside over the remainder of the year with total year growth still expected to be around  our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was  compared with an effective tax rate of  for the second quarter of  and  last quarter the increase in our tax rate reflects an increased proportion of us income relative to total income our tax rate will fluctuate with changes in the mix of us and ous income and with the impact of onetime item our second quarter  pro forma net income was  million or  per share compared with  million or  per share for the second quarter of  and  million or  per share for the first quarter of  the  million revenue deferral including the associated deferral of cost of sales and the income tax effects reduced gaap and pro forma net income per share in the first quarter of  by approximately  per share earnings per share benefited from the full impact of our  billion stock buyback as we retired approximately  million shares on january   at this point given the increase in the share price since the start of the asr the ultimate number of shares delivered under the asr may not change materially from the initial delivery as i indicated earlier pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends i will now summarize our gaap results gaap net income was  million or  per share for the second quarter of  compared with  million or  per share for the second quarter of  and  million or  per share for the first quarter of  gaap net income for the second quarter included a net benefit of  million associated with litigation settlements net of charges compared with  million of charges in the second quarter of  and  million of charges last quarter gaap net income for the second quarter of  also included a charge of approximately  million associated with purchased ip beginning in  we are required under gaap to report the excess tax benefits or deficiencies associated with employee stock awards in our tax provision rather than as an adjustment to be paid in capital as in prior periods the excess tax benefit included in our gaap results for the second quarter was  million contributing  per share compared with  million contributing  per share in the first quarter of  we have excluded these benefits from our pro forma results this amount will fluctuate quartertoquarter based on the volume of employee stock option exercises and the number of rsus vesting and the value of our stock we ended the quarter with cash and investments of  billion up from  billion as of march st  the increase reflects cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises and with that id like to turn it over to patrick wholl go over our procedure and clinical highlights patrick clingan thanks marshall of our second quarter procedure growth of  us procedures grew approximately  and outside of the united states procedures grew approximately  procedure trends were consistent with the first quarter with growth led by us general surgery and global urology in the united states both mature and growth procedures such as general and thoracic surgery outperformed our plan the majority of the out performance was driven by continued growth in our mature procedures in us urology the second quarter growth rate for da vinci prostatectomy was modestly higher than the first quarter we believe that our us prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market in us gynecology second quarter procedure growth sustained trends observed during the first quarter procedure growth in us gyn appears to be driven by consolidation of surgeries towards physicians that specialize in complex and cancer surgery who tend to be users of the da vinci system first quarter us general and thoracic surgery procedure adoption remains strong led by solid growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in the united states and existing surgeon retention and utilization remains strong sound growth trends in lobectomy and other thoracic procedures continued to show strength off of a small base second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications evaluating da vinci surgery one that we like to highlight is from dr rashidi from the university of texas and colleagues from providence health and services who published a study of more than  colorectal patients treated by  high volume surgeons within the providence health and services network in the american journal of surgery the authors found that in exchange for a longer operating time patients treated on the da vinci system experienced a threefold reduction in conversion rate and nearly a day shorter length of hospital stay compared to laparoscopy in addition the authors found that there was no difference in total direct cost between the two cohorts turning abroad procedure growth outside of the united states was approximately  in the second quarter led by the global adoption of da vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures general surgery and gynecology as we discussed last quarter the timing of the easter holidays from q into q which provided a tailwind to our first quarter results served as a headwind in the quarter likely reducing our outside of the united states procedure growth by an estimated  taken together first half procedure growth of  provides a better representation of procedure performance outside of the united states and either quarters result procedure growth was led by china germany and japan procedure growth in china was driven by strong expansion and system utilization as system placements remained the same pending issuance of new quota for civilian hospitals procedure growth in china is broad based with a number of specialties contributing to the strong performance in germany procedure growth is supported by installed base expansion that is driving strong adoption in urology with contributions from general surgery in japan dvp and dvpn continued to grow though yeartoyear comparisons have begun to slow as dvp adoption has crossed  during the quarter the first clinical experience on da vinci x occurred in germany initial procedures included urology and gynecology with strong utilization commenting on the experience dr vitt from san antonios hospital genoa ph stated da vinci x is ideal add on to our existing da vinci xi same feeling on the console globally evidence continues to build in support of the clinical and economic validation of da vinci surgery during the quarter an economic analysis studying the impact of da vinci partial nephrectomy in england was published in european urology the work was completed by hcd economics an affiliate of the university of chester comparing more than  partial nephrectomy patients between open and da vinci surgery the authors found that da vinci surgery lowered the total cost to treat during the first year after the procedure by an average of £ primarily by reducing postoperative and patient utilization from length of stay cancer and other readmissions and  day complications this concludes my remarks ill now turn the call over to calvin calvin darling thank you patrick i will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for  starting with procedures on our last call we estimated full year  procedure growth of  to  above the approximately  procedures performed in  now based largely upon continued strong results in us growth and mature procedure categories in china we are increasing our estimate for  we now anticipate full year  procedure growth within a range of  to  during the second half of the year we expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in part due to one fewer operating day during the third quarter as we move into the second half of the year we also expect contributions from china and japan to temper until we obtain a new quota and place additional systems in china and obtain additional procedural reimbursements in japan with regards to system placements a record high of  of the  second quarter system placements were structured as operating leases in the second half of  we expect the proportion of systems placed under operating leases will continue to increase the average selling price per system sold outright will vary quartertoquarter based upon factors including product regional and trading mix with increasing placements into costsensitive markets we expect that our average system selling price will continue to trend gradually lower in the back half of  as marshall mentioned no amounts were either deferred or released in q related to our da vinci x tradein program going forward we expect to defer no further revenue related to this program and expect to release and recognize substantially all of the  million accrued during the first quarter by the end of this year turning to gross profit on our last call we forecast  pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between  and  of net revenue we are now modestly raising the top end of the range and expect pro forma gross profit margin to be between  and  of net revenue turning to operating expenses as we have described previously we have accelerated our investments in several strategic areas that will benefit the company over the longterm accordingly we have ramped our operating expenses as we focus on execution on our last call we forecast pro forma  operating expenses to grow at the higher end of a range between  and  above  levels we continue to expect results at the high end of the range between  and  for the year on our last call we forecast our noncash stock compensation expense to range between  million and  million in  now based upon updated black scholes evaluation estimates we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between  million and  million we expect  other income to be between  million and  million compared to the  million to  million range forecast on our last call with regard to income tax we now expect our  pro forma income tax rate to be between  and  of pretax income higher than our previous guidance of  to  based upon a higher anticipated mix of us pretax profits during q we had  million diluted shares outstanding for eps calculations roughly equal to the first quarter as the share reduction related to the full quarter impact of the q accelerated share buyback was mostly offset by the dilutive effects of our higher stock price as a result of our higher stock price we dont expect the ultimate number of shares received and retired when the asr closes later this year to vary significantly versus the  million shares already retired in january that concludes our prepared comments we will now open the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from tycho peterson with jpmorgan go ahead please tycho peterson hey thanks first on x i know its early days obviously but any color you can provide on the funnel in terms of diversity of existing customers and maybe the types of customers that are emerging gary guthart i dont think wed call out anything surprising here we had indicated to you in prior quarters that we think cost sensitive customers particularly in europe are going to be interested and that remains so it may have broader rebate than that over time tycho peterson okay and then urology continue to do well here that hasnt reverted to lower growth rates you know i think you’d previously expected can you talk about that sequential pick up can you maybe just talk to the sustainability of those trends in the us urology dvp market marshall mohr hey tycho i think we continue to believe that our prostatectomy volumes are following broader prostate surgery trends as you know prostate surgery really only represents about third of all men diagnosed in the us with prostate cancer so time to time you’ll see movements between watchful waiting radiation and surgery we think – mostly youve seen the procedures recover from the prior uspstf decision in  where we worked through patients who had the disease progress we think at this stage youre just seeing general small movements between populations periodtoperiod tycho peterson okay i’ll leave at that thanks gary guthart thanks tycho operator thank you our next question is from bob hopkins with bank of america go ahead please bob hopkins hi thanks good afternoon can you hear me okay gary guthart hi bob yes bob hopkins great good afternoon so the first thing i wanted to touch on just kind of looking through the results which were obviously strong and pretty much across the board but the us capital number really stuck out as a strong number and you mentioned more kind of multisystem sales and repeat customers is this really a function of the increase in procedure volume growth and higher utilization or was there something else going on this quarter gary guthart i think its the former were seeing – first of all i think the consolidation of us customers into idns means that the negotiations are often happening when they are up and i think theyre looking across their portfolio of mis opportunities and making decisions in broader settings i think its a continuation of a trend weve been seeing over the past several quarters bob hopkins great and the other thing i just want to follow up is a couple of quick checks on the pipeline timelines you mentioned china and japan as constraining you in the back half is there any update at all on the china quota from a timing perspective or even your sense as to whether or not it could happen this year and also wanted to just get a quick update for timelines for sp beyond urology and the filings we could expect either later this year or into  thank you gary guthart sure i’ll – marshall ill let you take the china quota and ill take the sp marshall mohr okay china quota there is no new news here it is as we’ve stated before the quota system involves first the government – is tied up in the overall government – the governments overall planning process they did approve their budget in december we – after that it then rolls through a series of decisions about province spending as well as hospital spending and then eventually well hear something about a quota we dont know when that will be and what we would caution is that you put anything in the models for this year frankly because last time when the quota was approved it took some time before the tender offers that the hospitals have to go through to get them done gary guthart on the sp regulatory question we are targeting k for urology in the back half of the year theres a data collection going on at the ide sites for transoral robotic surgery and some lab based clinical development for other procedures as well as the trial site in asia we havent yet publicly projected our timelines for submissions after the urology k there will be a set that come it will be months not years after the k submission what that looks like will depend on the speed of closure of the clinical trial data and some of the conversations with fda about what kind of submissions theyd like and were not ready yet to anchor down those dates bob hopkins great that’s helpful thank you operator thank you well go next to david lewis with morgan stanley go ahead please david lewis good afternoon just maybe a few quick questions here gary just for you just the sp timing i know it came up in the pipeline but on fc and i know its pretty early can you give us any sense of the major markets us china europe which one our sense is us and china are kind of ahead of europe but thats not based on a whole bunch which region you think proceeds the other and is  a reasonable estimate for a launch in some geographic locale gary guthart so first to the question of which regions matter we think it will have a global appeal but i think youre right that united states and china and then europe will be interesting in terms of timing a lot of it will be predicated on regulatory pathways and what kind of data requirements there are we think there are real opportunities in china were going to make sure that we do that right with our joint venture partner we likewise think there is in the us and not ready yet to call when the launch dates are for both sets because of negotiations with clinical trial results europe likewise i think theres a little bit of uncertainty right now as to what kind of submission package will be required and thats one of the things were in the midst of working out both internally and we have conversations with regulatory authorities over time we will do a controlled launch when were ready so weve told you dont model any revenue into ‘ we have not yet published and are not ready to publish when the final launch will be well let you know as we get closer to some of the certainty on regulatory timelines david lewis okay very helpful and marshall just two quick kind of margin related questions for you the first is on gross margin given a greater systems mix i guess i was surprised to see gross margins as strong as they were and i wonder who wouldve thought that x which wasnt very material in the quarter would have also pressured margins so whats driving the margin strength and as it relates to x is that just because a lot of the components of x frankly are ready at scale in other places of the business and the second question related is looking at hiring we typically don’t ask about hiring but i think your hiring level this quarter is  above the next highest level thats pretty remarkable i wonder if you would just share with us where youre hiring and where those people are being deployed thank you gary guthart sure on the x margins x margins we had communicated before typically when we introduce a new product you see a little bit of a decrease in the margin and then we work to improve it over time you should – we did not expect as much of a decrease in margins due to x x as we said really is a result of putting together the parts that are already manufactured for other system and so we have worked out most of the cost effectiveness with that as far as total margins yeah the total margin came down a little bit due to the mix of systems i think it exceeded our expectations just because of the overall strength of procedures and the drive of  and its driving instrument and accessory revenue above our original expectations marshall mohr as far as headcount goes david we ended the quarter with  employees that was up a little over  from the last quarter end and it was  yearoveryear and it really does vary up with the strategic investments that were making in the business on that side the majority of the investments were in our product operations group in the quarter david lewis thank you very much operator thank you our next question comes from tao levy with wedbush go ahead please tao levy great thanks good afternoon may i could i wanted to ask on the sp platform so the pathway for i believe filing later on you know towards the end of this year and then assuming approval sometime next year how is the launch going to proceed is this a – well is an experienced da vinci surgeon going to be able to sit in front of the sp you know in front of a console and use the sp right off the bat or are they going to have to go through proctoring of different types of cases just any color there would be great gary guthart yeah just in broad brushes its a family member in the da vinci family and a lot of – we believe a lot of the learning and skills will be portable from one of the family members to the other part theyre not identical so therell be some learning that goes through that transition we think experienced da vinci surgeons will find that transition to be pretty manageable what that looks like and how its finally framed will evolve as we finish our clinical trials and our validations but id expect a lot of that to be portable i think in terms of rollouts well be at a controlled rollout when we come out and part of that controlled rollout will be for data generation at the first sites and also well have some constraints due to what our labelling will be at the first launch given the regulatory sequence and pathway feedback from the clinical trial sites has been really good about usability of the system and meeting the expectations they had for what they believe they could do with that clinically so far so good there and we also get pretty good insight into the characteristics of the system visà vis what theyre used to on si and xi and kind of the response to your initial question tao levy got you perfect and then just lastly anything special going on in japan theyve got way more systems than they have – than they need it at this point and they keep on buying more i dont know if theres – is there a government incentive or any credit there that they are using thanks marshall mohr hey tycho – sorry tao tao levy that’s close don’t worry marshall mohr japan has a very diffused healthcare system and hospital network systems so theyre not very concentrated in terms of where the patients are so – and while we are at a high level of penetration in dvp we still have a lot of pockets of patients who are treated in fairly remote areas in local hospitals so they continue to buy systems even be able to access some of the mainly urology patients that are out there gary guthart we’ve also been in japan for some number of years here and i think theres a little bit of building capacity in hopes of broader reimbursements over time tao levy perfect thanks guys operator thank you and well go next to amit hazan with citi go ahead please amit hazan thanks hey good afternoon guys just one on the quarter and then a couple longer term ones so on the quarter obviously going – just going back to the us system number a really strong number i wanted to ask about tradeins though they were weak again in the us its a second quarter in a row im just trying to kind of better understand why on one hand you’ve got this obvious growing pool of systems that need to be replaced so you shouldn’t be really replacing more systems every year on the other hand there seems to be a relationship between quarters where you had really strong de novo units like this this year so far both quarters and then tradeins kind of tend to be inversely recur ph in those quarters whats kind of the correct way to be thinking about modeling tradeins in the us gary guthart let me speak to our intent a little bit and ill ask calvin to jump in on the modeling side for us our thought process really has been to enable accounts with technologies and support that help them get to their clinical goals and in support their mis and mis program goals and if they can do that effectively with si were happy to support them in that regard if they want to add capacity or grow the system capability in some way that is benefited by our advanced technologies that helps us and drives a new system placement or new system sales so our incentives arent strongly built on tradeouts much more interested in aligning with how they want to build their programs and giving them access to technologies that make a difference in their procedures that leaves the lumpiness and tradeouts and thats okay with us calvin to the modeling i just give a little time to think about it go ahead calvin darling what i say i mean is that you have such strong procedure growth and such demand for access to systems among the surgeon population that in a lot of cases when hospitals are seeking to acquire new systems they look at the procedures and the surgeons that they want to be able to do within their robotics program and si can still serve a broad range of patients and can help them facilitate that so they tend to be buying more incremental systems than trading in amit hazan okay gary guthart as x matures in the market x maybe an opportunity for some folks who are happy with their capacity but want to upgrade up to additional capabilities and that may provide an opportunity for us in future quarters calvin darling and just quickly from the modeling perspective that you asked beware of using our past experience with our xi and previous system launches as the model for whats going to happen now because its a different world where you have again consolidated hospital networks that can align certain procedure characteristics with sets of procedures with a lot more ability to do so now than in the past so it could very well follow a different pattern this go around than it has in the past amit hazan okay so that could maybe possibly lead me into the next question which is on reimbursement it looks like prostate is getting a new medicare outpatient reimbursement codes for the first time i believe and i realize most of the dvp procedures cant really be done in one day just yet but it just got me thinking about the question of what the trigger might be for hospitals to start equipping their outpatient settings with da vinci i have to imagine that between hysterectomies moving that way and things like hernia now theres already enough volume to justify it nowadays so is something like prostate reimbursement any kind of an incur that can maybe drive boxes into outpatient setting and if not then what could be the trigger to do that calvin darling two important thoughts here one is in order to be able to do a surgery like a dvp in an outpatient setting first off that has to be done in a minimally invasive fashion so that you can have the patient be able to recover quick enough to get out of that setting the second thing is you – outpatient is really a billing setting not necessarily a side of care differentiator what we see over time is that as programs mature in the robotics capacity they have array of systems that can both serve really complex inpatient surgeries like thoracic or colorectal and they have sufficient volume of outpatient procedures like the ones you mentioned in hernia and gynecology and you could potentially dvp where you have a technique and a surgeon capable of getting a result that can get the patient out in the same day youll see them actually put systems in a multiple different types of settings typically still under the hospitals umbrella because theyre the ones who have the capability of treating the range of patients who come in with different complexities they might be either inpatient or outpatient but its usually by product maturity of the program as opposed to a specific reimbursement event amit hazan okay thanks very much guys calvin darling thanks amit operator thank you our next question comes from isaac ro with goldman sachs please go ahead isaac ro thanks very much good afternoon question for you on the x just trying to think through the gross margin implications of that product cycle as it plays out realize its a little early but just trying to think through some of the comments you made earlier around how purchasing is evolving for hospitals and so forth is that product cycle plays out could you give us some sense of what it means for your gross margin profile based on what you know now that would be helpful gary guthart initially the gross margin profile is not substantially different than our other products so it kind of fits in nicely i think what you are asking is over time could we see that there is pressure on the ultimate price that we charge for x i think well see we dont know its only been out in the market for a quarter and  but what weve said in the past is that were about the market expansion and if theres the opportunities to expand the market at the expense of a little bit of price we do that isaac ro thats helpful and then just as a follow up on the expense side as you move towards expanding the market interested in sort of allocation of resources and the sales force can you talk a little bit about just qualitatively how youre moving some of your top performers to help drive x conversion and then at the same time maybe thinking about adding new heads just interested in the interplay on investment in sales force thank you gary guthart yeah how we think about sales force investments really varies by region and maturity of the market so how were building the sales team in germany for example will look kind of qualitatively different than whats happening in the united states in general the united states weve had a stable structure growth in our key accounts teams no surprise and a little bit better stratification of levels in the force itself that gives us the opportunity to provoke and engage high level salespeople at the same time bring in people who can support highvolume accounts that are premature so the us is a well stratified sales force and germany in places like japan were really at the basic building stages and so the investments there are a little more filling empty slots and making sort of territory coverage’s is right isaac ro thank you operator thank you we now have a question from richard newitter with leerink partners please go ahead richard newitter hi thanks for taking the questions it seems like for the third quarter in a row china on the procedure growth side is exceeding your expectations and seemingly youre at capacity or you thought you’re at capacity in the fourth quarter and yet this is still kind of – your capacity utilization seems to be creeping higher anything to explain that are there certain types of procedures that are maybe just quicker and that as a percent of the mix in china is different than the us or can you explain what might be driving this gary guthart i think at the top line whats going on here is high belief in value of the procedures and the technology and a willingness to expand the number of hours that people are able to get procedures i think the biggest effect is that which is a willingness to work on weekends and for them to expand to afterhours use of devices that will dwarf the underlying which procedures in the mix but marshall you can clean up that answer if you like marshall mohr its absolutely right i mean this is all about – its a theoretical capacity that youre quoting and that capacity – that theoretical capacity is based on just averages that we see around the world be careful of averages and in china they are operating on saturdays sundays and late at night in order to get things done so i think garys answer is right gary guthart i think theres also an opportunity for us to learn from their experiences which is under capital constraint what kinds of barriers can they remove to get both good outcomes and high volumes and i think thats exciting for us and we have an open mind toward how were approaching it richard newitter great and then maybe just one followup on japan thats the other area where youre kind of seeing capacity constraint and so you get additional – on the procedure side at least until you get additional approvals can you maybe just remind us the key procedures that youre hoping are up for consideration next year and maybe – which ones represent the biggest market opportunities and do you feel theres any that might be further along with the approval agencies over there gary guthart in terms of maturity there are some that have been going through clinical trials and have a lot of data behind them and others that are using kind of existing data sources so the one that has the most structured data so far is gastrectomy and that is going to be exciting for us over time its a real market in japan the prevalence is quite high and so we have good hopes and optimism that that will go through the process other categories are things like gyn oncology which is of interest saw lobectomy calvin there are some others that… calvin darling yeah lobectomy procedures and some of the lower colon lar procedures are potential gary guthart yeah so i think the interest in broad use of da vinci in japan is very high we do not have assurance of that mhlw will accept it in the next insurance cycle although so far so good and we dont have assurance that the reimbursement levels will be any particular level and again so far the indicators are pretty good for us but thats still a work in process from the governments evaluation point of view and we stand by to support the surgical societies to answer questions for them as they need it richard newitter thank you operator thank you our next question is from larry biegelsen with wells fargo please go ahead larry biegelsen hey guys thanks for taking the question let me just start with hernia you received recently a specific inguinal hernia indication which includes positive data in the label could you talk about implications of that label and data and are you pursuing other specific indications for other procedures and i have one followup gary guthart sure on the first one this really is something around what gives us a little bit of freedom of – a little more freedom about what we can claim in our materials and so it allows us to be a little bit more specific versus the general and so for us we think that that just clarifies what our teams can speak about and so we think its an incremental positive its a small positive i think the data underlying it is supportive and the interactions with fda i think are ultimately helpful for the whole process this is one of a set of specific indications that we have pursued over the last couple of years and we do have a pipeline of the next set of things we want to do and get aligned and we have not publicly disclosed what those are and what the order is but i guess what id tell you is i expect more to come and again i think its a healthy process between us and the agency to supply data as we get it and that allows us a little more specific capability in terms of what we talk about larry biegelsen thanks and then i think on the – youre planning to finally launch a  millimeter stapler which should help with bariatric procedures is there any update on the timing there thanks for taking the questions gary guthart sure yeah we are working on additional staplers besides the ones that are in the market we have a  and a  remember staplers are characterized by not only their length but also the length of the staples that go into jaw there are a set of things that were working on beyond that we do think that there are opportunities to build staplers that can have broader use in general surgery we have not yet predicted or publicly disclosed what the expected time lines are we do have to take note of the enrolment and those things approach maturity will share with you where we are larry biegelsen thanks for taking the questions operator thank you well go next to brandon henry with rbc capital markets please go ahead brandon henry yeah thanks for taking my question can you provide an update on the australian clinical trial for the flexible catheter platform and any lessons youve learned from that trial and then when and where do you think we can see the data from the trial being published or presented and a couple of followups gary guthart yes thanks brandon i think the short answer is no i cant provide an update the data is being analyzed the clinical teams that are there are preparing abstracts and they will decide which meeting they want to show it and once they made a decision then were happy to share it with you as we said last time the results were very positive for us we were really happy with what we saw i think the scientific principal investigators need the chance to write their manuscripts and analyze the data and present it in a way that makes sense to them so we will wait for that and as we get clarity there were sure to share it with you brandon henry okay and then just more broadly can you help me understand some of the differences or the benefits for intuitives flexible catheter platform relative to some of the other platforms in the market like medtronic with its super dimension platform gary guthart sure i think what we can bring in our concept and our technology here is a couple of things one is we have novel sensing technologies that allow us to sense all the way along the catheter length with a high degree of certainty that helps us in terms of understanding and navigating tortuous pathways thats one the second thing is the use of robotic assistance gives you stability and navigation capabilities that are very hard to do manually and so those are technical benefits what could they result in in terms of clinical benefits the hope there is that you can get to more distal locations that are otherwise hard to get to in tortuous pathways and that are more accurate in terms of tissue sampling because you have high degree of stability and better imaging and targeting now those claims have to be backed up and so thats the hypothesis and thats the set of trials and data and analysis that we’re going after and i think people are excited about flexible technologies in general by some of the technologies that our competitors and other med companies have put out there i think the excitement is there and the question is can you go a little further and get a little more predictability and we think we have technologies and capabilities that can do that brandon henry okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from travis steed with cantor fitzgerald please go ahead travis steed thanks for taking the question calvin darling travis youll be the last questioner so make it a good one travis steed okay so you placed a decent amount of si systems in the quarter did those customers have an option to purchase x and just any color on how customers are deciding between the two systems recognizing were still very early on gary guthart so i think the question was either theres a fair number of sis in the system in the quarter despite the availability of x travis steed yes gary guthart right i think first while we were pleased with approval timelines of x in the us and europe there are still many markets that x is not yet approved in so some of the sis are just purchases by folks whose choices were si or xi in the case of china its – their choices si right now not xi so some of it is just that in other cases some of the negotiations are multiquarter negotiations and are right at the endpoint and so they will finish the transaction based on where they started those are opportunities for us to go back to those customers over time thats one of the reasons that we had the revenue deferral and the offers for people to evaluate whether they want to make a change so thats mostly what the dynamics are marshall mohr and then travis the other point to think about is just – the lumpy of the accruals came mid quarter so i think europe was in the beginning of practical and the us was the beginning of may so you didnt really have a full quarter to get out get the team in and communicate to all your customers what x is relative to other products that may have already been in a long sales cycle travis steed okay gary guthart just a little color commentary on x i think the customer base and our field understood well what x is what its benefits are i think the logic of x is well understood and where it fits in the line is well understood and were pleased with that travis steed okay and just one quick followup i think i know the answer to this but is it still your view we should be modeling in  expense growth below you revenue growth marshall mohr actually what we’ve said is that expense growth – operating expense growth will grow  for the year travis steed im sorry in  kind of longer term gary guthart do we expect a while a back… marshall mohr sorry and in  what we’ve said is we expect to dial back so that we are adding leverage travis steed okay all right thanks for taking the questions gary guthart thanks travis well that was our last question as we’ve said previously while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues profits and cash flow during these conference calls our colonization’s focus remains an increasing value by enabling surges to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma weve built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and i assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference this concludes todays call we thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve the surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months

marshall will provide a review of our second quarter financial results patrick will discuss marketing and clinical highlights then i will provide our updated financial outlook for  and finally we will host a questionandanswer session with that ill turn it over to gary gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director good afternoon and thank you for joining us on the call today in the second quarter our company performance was strong highlighted by sustained procedure growth across multiple geographies improved margins and continued customer preference for our new products turning first to procedures global procedure growth for the quarter was nearly  with prior quarter trends continuing drivers of growth included us general surgery growth in the use of da vinci surgical systems outside the united states and modest growth in us urology and gynecology inguinal hernia repair and ventral hernia repair growth remains strong and growth in colorectal surgery was solid procedure growth was variable by country in europe with accelerating growth in germany both the nordics and france experienced modest improvement relative to q growth rates in the uk growth decelerated slightly from q in asia procedure growth in japan was solid again in the quarter while growth in korea was robust and accelerated over q growth rate growth in procedures in china was also strong patrick will review procedure trends in greater detail later in the call we placed  da vinci systems in the quarter up from  in q of  our most capable model da vinci xi represented roughly three quarters of new capital placements system placement orders included an increase in dual consoles and the addition of integrated table motion leading to higher feature content on average than q placements in europe and asia increased over q while us placements were up slightly up relative to last quarter marshall will take you through our finances in more detail later in the call our operations teams have performed well over the past several quarters and remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing design and supply chains q was another strong quarter of operations efficiency and cost reduction performance we plan to continue these optimization efforts as they provide significant financial flexibility for us in coming years turning to highlights of our second quarter operating results procedures grew nearly  over the second quarter of last year we shipped  da vinci surgical systems up from  in the second quarter of  revenue for the quarter was  million up  from the prior year pro forma gross profit margin was  compared to  in the second quarter of last year instrument and accessory revenue increased to  million up  total recurring revenue in the quarter was  million representing  of total revenue we generated a pro forma operating profit of  million in the quarter up  from the second quarter of last year and pro forma net income was  million up  from q of  recent launches of xi products including xi intraoperative table motion have been well received as has expansion of advanced instrument lines including our stapling products we are continuing to invest in these line extensions to increase the value and utility of our xi offering we have also increased investment in advanced imaging including significant refinements in our intraoperative d endoscopes image processing for realtime and preoperative images and near infrared fluorescence imaging our single port or sp program is progressing to plan as sp approaches clinical readiness we are conducting inhouse validations and initiating work with clinical trial sites and regulatory agencies we expect first markets to include head and neck surgery urology and colorectal surgery over time i expect this list of applications to evolve as our business has strengthened we have increased our mid and longterm investments in research and development we have been increasing our investments in imaging analytics and new product architectures based on our belief that a substantial opportunity exists to enable better outcomes and to expand access to our technologies globally we expect quartertoquarter variation in spending and increased fixed expenses in the back half of this year calvin will take you through our projected spending later in the call as we move forward in  we remain focused on the following first expanding the use of da vinci in general surgery and thoracic surgery particularly colorectal surgery and hernia repair second advancing our ecosystem including expanding our xi line and taking our sp product into initial clinical use third driving our organizational capabilities in markets in europe and asia and finally assisting our customers in their efforts to maximize the comprehensive value of their programs ill now turn the call over to marshall who will review financial highlights marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president thank you gary ill be describing our results on a nongaap or pro forma basis which excludes specified legal settlements and claim accruals stockbased compensation and amortization of purchased ip we provide pro forma information because we believe that business trends and operating results are easier to understand on a pro forma basis i will also summarize our gaap results later in my script we have posted reconciliations of our pro forma results to our gaap results on our website so that there is no confusion second quarter  revenue was  million an increase of  compared with  million for the second quarter of  and an increase of  compared with first quarter revenue of  million second quarter of  procedures increased nearly  compared with the second quarter of  and increased  compared with last quarter procedure growth has been driven by general surgery in the us and urology worldwide revenue highlights are as follows instrument and accessory revenue of  million increased  compared with the last year and increased  compared with the first quarter of  growth in instruments and accessory revenue generally reflect procedure growth instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including stocking orders was approximately  per procedure this metric has fluctuated in a tight range over the past couple of years the slight decrease in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of  and the first quarter of  primarily reflects the impact of customer buying patterns partially offset by increased usage of our stapling and vessel sealer products while instrument and accessory usage per procedure has been relatively constant customer buying patterns fluctuate in the short term system revenue of  million increased  compared with the second quarter of  and increased  compared with last quarter these increases primarily reflect higher average system selling prices higher system placements and revenue associated with lease buyout transactions  systems were placed in the second quarter compared with  systems in the second quarter of  and  systems last quarter  systems were placed under operating lease transactions in the current quarter compared with  last quarter and  systems in the second quarter of  as a reminder revenue on operating lease transactions is recognized ratably over the life of the lease as of the end of the second quarter there were  systems out in the field under operating leases we generated approximately  million of revenue associated with operating leases in the quarter compared with  million in second quarter of  and  million in the last quarter we also generated approximately  million of revenue during the quarter from lease buyouts compared with  million in the first quarter and  million in the second quarter of last year we exclude the impact of operating leases and lease buyouts from our system asp calculations globally our average system selling price of  million was approximately  higher than both the second quarter of  and last quarter the increase compared with prior quarters reflect a higher mix of dual console systems and sales of table motion we introduced intraoperative table motion in europe in the third quarter of  and early this year in the us during the first and second quarters we recognize  million and  million of table motion software respectively both the mix of dual consoles and number of table motion placements will fluctuate quartertoquarter service revenue of  million increased  yearoveryear and increased approximately  compared with the first quarter of  the yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter increases reflect growth in our installed base of da vinci systems outside of the us results were as follows second quarter revenue outside of the us of  million increased  compared with  million for the second quarter of  and increased  compared with the first quarter of  million the increase compared with the previous year is comprised of  growth in recurring revenue which is driven by procedure growth of  and increased systems revenue of  the increase compared to the first quarter reflects systems revenue growth of  and recurring revenue growth of  outside the us we placed  systems in the second quarter compared with  systems in the second quarter of  and  systems last quarter current quarter systems sales included  into europe  into china and  into japan system placements outside the us will continue to be lumpy as some of these markets are in the early stages of adoption some markets are highly seasonal reflecting budget cycles or vacation patterns and sales into some markets are constrained by government regulations moving on to the remainder of the pl the pro forma gross margin for the second quarter of  was  compared with  for the second quarter of  and  for the first quarter of  compared with the first quarter of  the higher gross margin reflects reduction in product costs favorable costs associated with our scope exchange program manufacturing efficiencies and higher dual console mix lease buyouts and table motion sales future margins will fluctuate based on the mix of our newer products the mix of systems and instrument accessory revenue costs associated with our scope exchange program our ability to further reduce product costs improve manufacturing efficiency and in the long term the potential reinstatement of the medical device tax pro forma operating expenses increased  compared with the second quarter of  and decreased nearly  million compared with last quarter the increase over the second quarter of  reflects increased investments in advanced imaging advanced instrumentation and nextgeneration robotics and increased head count the decrease compared with the prior quarter reflects lower payroll taxes partially offset by increased head count – head count costs particularly in our product operations areas our pro forma effective tax rate for the second quarter was  compared with an effective tax rate of  for the second quarter of  and  last quarter the increase in the tax rate compared with  reflects onetime benefits reflected in  our second quarter  pro forma net income was  million or  per share compared with  million or  per share for the second quarter of  and  million or  per share for the first quarter of  as i indicated earlier pro forma income provides an easier comparison of our financial results and business trends i will now summarize our gaap results gaap net income was  million or  per share for the second quarter of  compared with  million or  per share for the second quarter of  and  million or  per share for the first quarter of  we ended the quarter with cash and investments of  billion up from  billion as of march   the increase was primarily driven by cash generated from operations and proceeds from stock option exercises as our cash builds well continue to evaluate our approach to capital allocation and with that id like to turn it over to patrick who will go over our procedure and clinical highlights patrick clingan  finance director thanks marshall of our second quarter procedure growth of nearly  us procedures grew approximately  and ous procedures grew approximately  during the first half of  global procedure growth increased to approximately  compared to approximately  in the second half of  and approximately  in the first half of  we expect our procedure growth rate to moderate in the second half of  in the united states second quarter procedure growth continued to outpace our expectations second quarter growth in our mature procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter general and thoracic procedure growth remained robust in us urology second quarter growth in da vinci prostatectomy and kidney procedures slowed modestly compared to the first quarter of  we continue to believe that our us prostatectomy volumes have been tracking to the broader prostate surgery market and we expect prostatectomy growth to return to levels similar to prostate cancer diagnoses over time in us gynecology second quarter procedures grew modestly yearoveryear growth led by malignant and complex benign hysterectomy continuing the recent trend we estimate a larger proportion of da vinci hysterectomy procedures were performed by gynecologic oncologists during the second quarter similar to the first quarter us singlesite gynecology procedures declined compared to the second quarter of  in the us procedures for benign gynecologic conditions slightly grew during the first half of  exceeding our expectations second quarter us general surgery procedure adoption remained strong led by robust growth in hernia repair and continued adoption of colorectal procedures hernia repair continues to contribute the largest volume of new procedures in general surgery and surgeon retention and expansion remains encouraging cholecystectomy procedures slightly declined in the quarter with growth in multiport procedures nearly offsetting declines in singlesite procedures second quarter was another quarter with a large number of clinical publications and presentations evaluating da vinci surgery of these i have selected a few studies that you may find interesting intuitive is among the founding partners for the american hernia society quality collaborative initiative or the ahsqc and this quarter two preliminary analyses comparing da vinci to open or laparoscopic complex ventral hernia repair were brought forward the first was a podium presentation at the american hernia society annual meeting by dr poulose from vanderbilt comparing da vinci to open retromuscular hernia repair this patient matched analysis involving data from multiple institutions found that da vinci reduced hospital length of stay by three days without significant differences in surgical site infections readmissions or reoperations in addition a paper was published in surgical endoscopy by dr warren and colleagues from the university of south carolina the authors used their institutions submissions to ahsqc to compare da vinci to laparoscopic retromuscular hernia repair their study found that with a longer operative time da vinci reduced the hospital length of stay by one day and also enabled a greater percentage of patients to receive fascial closure and extraperitoneal placement of mesh to which the authors attribute a reduced likelihood of hernia recurrence or bowel adhesions next as marshall mentioned earlier sales of our intraoperative table motion technology were strong in the quarter during the quarter the first clinical publication reviewing this technology was published in the international journal of colorectal disease by dr morelli and colleagues from the university of pisa in a small case series of colorectal resections surgeons used table motion to reposition the patient in an average of three to four times per procedure the authors suggested that the technology may improve patient safety by reducing the amount of time in extreme patient positions and stated the da vinci xi plus the new operating table gives the potential to optimize gravity exposure and provides a quick access to different surgical objectives that is important in colorectal surgery turning abroad procedure growth outside of the united states was approximately  in the second quarter led by the global adoption of da vinci prostatectomy with solid contributions from kidney procedures and colorectal resections compared to the first quarter of  second quarter procedure growth improved in europe and was similar to the first quarter in asia outside of the us second quarter procedure performance varied by country with strong growth in germany china and south korea in certain countries where our urology business has become more mature such as the united kingdom and nordic countries procedures continue to grow at a slower rate emerging procedures are in an early stage in these markets and we are engaged with a broad range of stakeholders working to enable procedure adoption into gynecologic and general surgery in japan partial nephrectomy growth accelerated in the first quarter following approval of national reimbursement during the quarter a metaanalysis sponsored by the south korean national evidencebased healthcare collaborating agency or neca was published in the annals of surgical treatment and research it reviewed da vinci and laparoscopic colon cancer resection the metaanalysis included nearly  patients and found that with a longer operative time da vinci surgery resulted in a more rapid return of normal diet and bowel function lower blood loss and a shorter hospital stay this governmentsponsored health technology assessment adds to the number of hcas has have evaluated da vinci surgery and a broad range of procedures over the years i will conclude my remarks by highlighting one of the largest population base studies on the impact of da vinci prostatectomy published in the journal of urology by dr pearson and colleagues from the university of chicago using data from the national cancer database this study includes nearly  prostatectomy patients treated with either da vinci or open surgery after matching the patient populations for risk factors da vinci surgery was shown to reduce positive surgical margins across low medium and high risk cohorts as well as reduce use of radiation therapy day readmissions and day mortality compared to open surgery dr koch from indiana university published a letter alongside the study titled robotic versus open prostatectomy end of controversy in which he stated that any debate over robotic prostatectomy should be put to rest this concludes my remarks i will now turn the call over to calvin calvin darling  senior directorfinance investor relations thank you patrick i will be providing you with our updated financial outlook for  starting with procedures on our last call we estimated fullyear  procedure growth of  to  above the approximately  procedures performed in  we are increasing our estimate for  we now anticipate full year  procedure growth within a range of  to  in regards to certain forwardlooking metrics we have the following expectations we anticipate fewer lease buyouts and lower upgrade and other system revenue in q and q than we saw in q second half  system asps will likely be lower than q driven by product and channel mix we expect a directionally higher proportion of our system placements in q and q to come from operating leases than we saw in q turning to gross profit on our last call we forecast  pro forma gross profit margin to be within a range of between  and  of net revenue we are now increasing our estimate we now expect full year  pro forma gross profit to be within a range of between  and  of net revenue turning to operating expenses based upon investments we are making in key areas of the business we expect expense growth will accelerate in the second half of  we continue to forecast pro forma  operating expenses to grow between  and  above  levels consistent with our last call we expect our noncash stock compensation expense to range between  million and  million in  compared to  million in  we expect other income to total approximately  million in  higher than the  million to  million forecast on our last call due primarily to higher interest income with regard to income tax we continue to expect our  pro forma income tax rate to be between  and  of pretax income depending primarily on the mix of us and international profits that concludes our prepared comments we will now open the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator certainly operation instructions one moment please okay and our first question comes from the line of ben andrew of william blair please go ahead ben c andrew  william blair  co llc good afternoon thanks for taking the question gary maybe just start out by talking about the increased investments in opex in the back half obviously you guys have always been looking for opportunities there but talk a bit more granularly about where those investments are coming and when we may see some payoffs i recall it took about a year for the european investments to kick in gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director sure as weve said before i think the messaging here has been pretty consistent some of the investments are in technology things like sp starting to move into fieldbased investment and scale rather than just the upfront d so youre seeing some growth in that we have some other technology investments that are a little broader weve talked about imaging and thats kind of a multistep process some of it is on the acquisition side new kinds of endoscopes some of its on the software side and some of it is in the ability to enhance our florescence imaging portfolio some of those things will become commercial in future quarters some of them are a little longer multiyear types of investments with regard to investments outside of rd you know weve been growing our investments in regions around the world where we think theres real opportunity from japan to germany and france and others thatll continue i think that be some of those investments are doing well for us we have opportunity to perform better than we have thus far and so the right kinds of investments there are sometimes in clinical data and clinical trials sometimes in other market development efforts sometimes in our resources and head count and again those things can be effective from a couple of quarters out to multiyears out depending on what the activity is ben c andrew  william blair  co llc okay and then two more quick ones for me please in europe you talked about some of the investments in emerging procedures is that a protracted multiyear process to move beyond urology and the initial gyn procedures that youve kind of started to mature in certain geographies gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director i think that you can see early success sooner than years but i think broad adoption in many of these places is a multiyear process it starts with leading surgeons and key opinion leaders and surgical society endorsement and goes from there in some cases we need interactions with payers and reimbursement so i dont think have you to wait years to see the early indicators but full penetration is often more than a year process ben c andrew  william blair  co llc great and then finally in the sp you did say head and neck can you be more precise would that be sleep apnea or is this more thyroidectomy do you have some initial thoughts on where specifically please thank you gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director yeah so i think in the beginning its really starting in the markets were already participating in so transoral more than for example thyroidectomy i think this is more around surgery in the throat and for sure theres cancer indications for that there may be benign indications part of what were talking to regulatory bodies about are clinical requirements for them to make some of those assessments and varies from what happens in europe to what happens in the us to what happens in asia so that will play out in time but think of head and neck starting point as tors it may have other applications in neck surgery over time i think that sp is a pretty powerful platform and where we start and where it evolves to will differ as surgeons get a chance to experience it for themselves operator okay thank you and the next question is from tycho peterson of jpmorgan please go ahead tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks first question gary can you maybe just provide a little bit more clarity on sp timelines i understand youre lining up the initial sites now it sounds like from some of the discussions youre really not expecting that to be much of a revenue contributor in  so can you maybe just talk a little bit about how we should think about the rollout next year gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director sure so first step here is clearances and some clinical data to support that clearance  will be really focused on data generation while i expect some revenue i dont think it will be a material revenue contributor in  a lot of that will be building the foundation the evidence foundation some of the clinical work and then i think  it starts to become more of a material contributor for us and as we get our clearances and start to solidify that timeline well color that  up more for you tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then switching over to hernia i think you talked in the past about doing some initial trial work can you maybe talk a little bit about where that stands in terms of any patient enrollment and how we should think about timelines around the trial for day oneyear and twoyear followup gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director ill turn that to patrick patrick clingan  finance director yeah so we have a number of different initiatives ongoing as it relates to sponsoring evidence development in hernia repair the two presentation and publication that i mentioned on the call from the ahsqc is among the investments weve made in helping support surgeons bring forward the outcomes that theyre getting with da vinci compared to the alternatives tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then just last one you had noted some delays in europe around tenders from competitive bake off  just anything changed from your perspective this quarter gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director no nothing new to note i think that tender offers in competitive interaction is the new normal i think our teams are doing great i think their performance has been effective i think were communicating well we have a broad portfolio that allows us to engage the customer at different levels depending on what their needs are so nothing new to report tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks operator thank you and the next question from the line of david lewis of morgan stanley please go ahead david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc good afternoon just a couple of quick questions from me gary one for you and then kind of a clarifying financial question so gary i appreciate the incrementally more detail you gave us in the pipeline this quarter so two pieces first is analytics can you just give us a broader sense of what the word analytics means to you in intuitive and then on imaging is the next disclosure were likely to see in advanced imaging an approval or simply an announcement of an imaging clinical study and then i had a quick financial followup gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director i think analytics has multiple components in it as you may know the majority of our systems are realtime connected to the internet today i think over  of systems are online they report back information to us mostly around the system performance itself what it is itself is doing rather than say patient information that data can be turned into insights for the company and for our customers and we have been doing that for some time now so theres that type of analytics going forward i think that as our computational structures get more powerful we can bring some of that intelligence more realtime so rather than offline insights you can start generating realtime insights thats a multiyear pathway i think its interesting and challenging i think theres longterm potential in it but were moving down that pathway making sure that we have good access and fast access and low latency access to our devices in the field and then bringing to bear information that can help surgeons as theyre performing the procedure and youll see from us in future years a series of products that come out using that set of kind of digital pipeline turning to imaging there are a couple of different things we are releasing endoscopes at a fairly regular clip and improving that set of technologies we made a technology change in the type of imaging we use when we switched to xi that has allowed for faster iteration for us in the kinds of imaging we do so theres that kind of thing thats going on at kind of a regular heartbeat our customers are pretty well aware of where those things are there are other things that weve talked about other indications for fluorescence were more likely to talk to you about whats happening clinically there than to announce a launch so youll have some warning prior to launch david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc okay thats helpful and then just calvin or marshall just thinking about the systems guidance into the back half of the year a couple of components i note this quarter that operating leases were down for the first time in several quarters yet i think you said operating leases will pick back up in the back half of the year so sort of whats the driver there and then just on mix or asps going lower for systems in the back half im assuming thats tied to your view of different geographies less xis or less consoles dual consoles just give us some flavor on sort of those two dynamics why youre so confident operating leases tick back up and asps tick down thank you marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president sure so philosophically first of all we provide our customers leases to provide some flexibility in how they get into robotics and its proven out to be – to work out pretty well for both them and us this last quarter we just saw a fewer number than the previous quarter the previous quarter if you recall was   we would expect it to be more like q than it was q so thats the increase that calvin was referring to as far as asps go seasonally systems revenue is stronger in q systems drive a slightly lower gross margin than do instruments and accessories so that mix alone will cause margins to go down we also would expect a little bit better performance again due to seasonal factors in the nonus markets or the outside of the us and so that mix also will drive revenues down a little and then we expect to continue to see growth in stapling and vessel sealing in our newer technology products and those also drive slightly lower margins so a lot of the mix will cause margins to go down in the next couple of quarters david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc marshall none of these things seem to me to be new dynamics these seem to be ordinary operating dynamics for intuitive is that sort of how you see it marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president for the most part the seasonal things are i think the new thing is as we drive the new product revenue thats increases over previous quarters calvin darling  senior directorfinance investor relations and david if were talking about margins the one thing that was kind of different in the second quarter was on the service side you saw a pretty marked increase in the service gross profit in the second quarter and during the quarter we were able to utilize more refurbished scopes for our scope replacement program with customers were going to be expanding the program as the base builds out in the second half and its going to require a much higher proportion of new scopes at higher cost and lower margin to replenish so thats something that will be a headwind in the second half david ryan lewis  morgan stanley  co llc okay thank you very much operator thank you and the next question is from the line of bob hopkins of bank of america please go ahead robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch thanks can you hear me okay gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director we can robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch great good afternoon so marshall just to continue on this conversation around margins you know because last quarter you commented on mix on how you didnt think youd be able to sustain  and now the guidance is going up on gross margin and i understand theres a lot of moving pieces here so just from a topdown perspective from where you sit today when you look forward at the business should we be thinking about low s gross margin as something that can be sustained over time just give us a sense of what youve just been learning here in the first half of this year as it relates to a more sustainable outlook for gross margins longer term marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah i think weve given you the guidance for the remainder of the year we think that thats the best crystal ball that we have at this point there are a lot of moving parts and its hard to predict exactly where each one will come out and so ill leave it at that i dont want to get into where we think it will go long term long term those same moving parts will cause us to not have high confidence in exactly where theyll come out although know that well manage things very diligently as you know last year we put in some programs to reduce the costs of xi and xi related product and those have been successful and thats part of what were seeing here in the year to year improvement robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch but i mean in terms of thinking about the biggest moving pieces what are the things that you have us focus on as we think a little bit longer term when we try to consider what a sustainable gross margin would look like for the rest of the company gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director yeah i dont think weve put a stake in the ground and i dont think that im prepared to do that right now robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch okay well no anyway we could take it offline but thank you for that and then gary one other thing i wanted to ask about – two quick things one on just the eyepopping number of  billion now in cash on the balance sheet and you get the question quite frequently but im just curious now with this almost  of the market cap in cash are there sizable ma targets out there that youre considering and thats why there hasnt been anything incremental done with the cash just would love to get be an updated view there and then you mentioned on the topic of advanced imaging and timelines for future products you said some of these approvals could come in future quarters i was just curious when you made that comment were you talking about advanced imaging specifically gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director well lets speak to cash and then well go to the organic side we look at the cash and think were at an interesting point in the companys evolution here on the one hand i think that customer acceptance of our products has been really high were seeing i think great momentum on the clinical side in terms of clinical acceptance we have a couple of things going on we have some new platforms we want to bring to the market that i think are outstanding are very well done and wellconceived that will take some investment for us to do the other thing is that we see proliferation of folks who want to enter the market with competitive offerings and thats both an opportunity for us and a requirement for some diligence and the opportunity is some of those technologies are interesting and may be interesting to us other ones are things where we may want to speed up or adjust our strategy as the market evolves as we think about the cash broadly our first thought is can we use the cash productively to drive future growth organically our second thought is are there ma opportunities that for the long term are good for the company the answer to both of those are there opportunities the third are are there other ways we can deploy capital with a longterm view for the benefit of shareholders and that might be in buybacks or dividends or other things so were disciplined about thinking about capital allocation i think this is a special time in the companys history and were walking through how we think about cash with a fair amount of discipline and diligence you had asked a question on product releases why dont you ask it again just to make sure i hit it robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch sure you made a comment about the timing of new product releases and you said some will take many of these years and some of those approvals could come in future quarters and i was just curious as to whether that was a broad comment or whether you were specifically speaking to advanced imaging gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director a broad comment there are some imaging things that are kind of nearer product things that look a lot like what we have today and there are some longterm imaging investments and so the submission pipeline and our regulatory interactions are a pretty full pipeline robert adam hopkins  bank of america merrill lynch thank you very much operator okay thank you and the next question is from the line of larry keusch of raymond james please go ahead lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc thank you gary just wanted to pick up on your last answer on the imaging if you were to sort of think about all the efforts in analytics and imaging that the company is working on and you were to take this out several years what would be the benefits to the surgeon at that time with these technologies embedded versus whats available today in xi gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director yep its a good question theres a couple of things that i think drive some of the variability that you see in surgery so its really interesting if you ask the question and theres some research out there – surgery in general not just intuitive how much better in terms of outcomes and lower complications is the top th percentile surgeon versus the average surgery surgeon and the spread is quite big as you look at that theres a lot of variability in surgical performance and so you ask the question what drives that variability why and some of it not all of it but some of it is that what youre looking for in visual images is subtle where are nerves where are cancer boundaries where are ureters whats the right tissue to section plane those things are subtle and take a long time for people to internalize and the best do it better and so what were trying to do here is find technologies that make it easier for other surgeons to be as good as the best and we think that matters imaging will play a large role in it so going forward a decade what youd really like to be able to do is mark tissues of interest in real time paint for the surgeon what the elements and boundaries are that allow for a good dissection or the proper resection or the best margin performance and thats whats really directing our investments lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc okay thats really helpful and then for marshall i guess two quick ones the per procedure revenue certainly was at a lower level than weve seen in some time you definitely mentioned some customer buying patterns in there so if you could just help us understand what that means and then on china you did a number of systems in the quarter just wanted to figure out where we were with the quota are those kind of oneoffs now in any given quarter marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president so as it relates to my comments on customer buying patterns were able to measure or look at what happens with instrument accessory usage and from that what weve determined is that the usage really hasnt changed a lot surgery by surgery and so when we see fluctuations and what theyre buying versus what theyre using there are times when they use more than they buy and times when they buy more than they use and it just happens that – and its going to fluctuate quarter to quarter and that was my comment on the short term and so what we saw this quarter was they used more than they purchased and so i dont have a great explanation for it beyond that thats just what we see on the other hand we have do have distributors that buy in bulk because theyre holding inventory to sell to their end customers and we do see fluctuations in those numbers as well so the combination of the two direct hospitals that we sell to as well as distributors we can actually measure or identify what is customer buying pattern i dont think – we dont see anything there that alarms us in one way or another lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc okay and china marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president china china we sold four systems this quarter those systems were sold to military hospitals the quota that we were selling to and couple of past years expired at the end of december and were awaiting for the government to approve a new quota we dont have great information as to when that will occur gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director might describe the differences between military hospitals and nonmilitary hospitals and visàvis quotas marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president yeah the quota system that we had was for public hospitals and there is a process by which were classified as high technology and theres a quota established by the government its in conjunction with their normal budget process their normal budget process this year has been delayed so thats why were not sure exactly when theyll approve that and then when well get a quota for it military hospitals buy independent of those public hospitals and weve been selling to military hospitals all along frankly and have a number of placements at them lawrence s keusch  raymond james  associates inc okay great very helpful thank you marshall l mohr  chief financial officer  senior vice president yep operator okay thank you next question from the line of brandon henry of rbc capital markets please go ahead brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc yeah thanks for taking my question obviously intuitive has posted better than expected gross margins in the first half of the year and i think were all trying to figure out how sustainable that is so could you help us try to quantify or maybe bucket into several categories what were the drivers of the yearoveryear increase in gross margins in the first half of the year for  versus the first half of the year in  calvin darling  senior directorfinance investor relations yeah im not sure we can list out item by item a specific contribution but we have been focusing obviously on reducing costs for quite some time and managing our fixed costs and were really pleased with the progress we look at where we sit six months into the year were at  on a yeartodate basis and that coincides with the upper end of the  to  guidance range but q was an exceptionally strong quarter for gross margin and i think we wanted to leave some specific comments there specifically on the product side we would expect a higher proportion of sales of newer products as was described in lower proportion of dual console sales and probably more sales through distributors at lower pricing and lower margins and i think i already mentioned previously on the service side we had some real benefits on the scope exchange in the second quarter which are unlikely to continue in the second half brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc okay and then separately – i think you guys mentioned some slight slowing in prostatectomy growth in q can you give us some more details on this comment and kind of discuss whats implied for prostatectomy growth in the updated guidance range are we now through the bolus of patients that previously deferred treatment thanks patrick clingan  finance director hey brandon its tough to know where exactly you are with the patient population that may have deferred treatment what we saw in the quarter was just a slight slowing of growth from what we saw in the first quarter and the second half of  or frankly all throughout  how much of that is associated with having worked through any potential bolus that may be out there is difficult to predict though i think as youve heard us say a few times in the past over time we do expect that prostatectomy volumes are likely to return towards the rate of diagnoses and our recent history and the recent growth rates weve seen in  or the first half of  we believe exceed that growth rate brandon henry  rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator okay thank you and the next question from the line of rick wise of stifel nicolaus please go ahead rick wise  stifel nicolaus  co inc good afternoon everybody let me start off with procedures again i just wanted to make sure i understood the comment about the second half procedure growth slowing yes i see that comps are modestly tougher is it something about ous is it the urology sort of recovery if you will slowing can you just help us better understand your thinking there patrick clingan  finance director hey rick yeah you mentioned the growth rate comparisons get a little harder in the second half of the year the mature procedure contributions that we saw in the first half of the year we dont think will be as strong in the second half of the year we continue to expect and well continue to drive growth in us general surgery and in our overseas markets in urology and early stage of urgent procedures rick wise  stifel nicolaus  co inc okay back on gross margin clearly it sounds from your comments that table motion adoption which has been in your words well received has been one factor helping margins where are we in sort of the penetration of the installed base i mean  converted  and is this a tailwind now – leaving aside all of the other moving factors is this a positive tailwind now for a year or two or three calvin darling  senior directorfinance investor relations yeah i dont think i want to get into specific units on this were really pleased with the progress were making and the strong market response from the customers i think marshall mentioned in his script we had  million of revenue attributable to table motion it was roughly split  between new installations and systems in the field so again it was a strong quarter but i think well see how it heads gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director the history of selling back into the installed base rather than new installs is that you have a few quarters of strong performance and then it tends to tail off folks who are going to be interested in it tend to move forward quickly and then mostly it will be a go forward so you can look at the history to sort of give you a guide as to how much that is calvin darling  senior directorfinance investor relations yeah and we do have roughly around  or so da vinci xis out in the world at this point in time and weve made some progress on that theres still some more out there rick wise  stifel nicolaus  co inc got you and just one last one for you gary if i could at sages this year it was very clear that intuitives messaging around looking at total procedure cost in the hospital for robotics and how much economic sense it made – robotics makes when i listen to the looming competition from medtronic at their analyst day and your friends at verb theyre very focused on lowering per procedure robotic costs to it seems like in their words laparoscopic levels how do you react how do you deal how do you compete with that approach given their entrenched instrument capabilities and will your new platforms address that per procedure cost aspect of positioning you to better address some of these factors thanks so much gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director sure i think the first thing of some of the messaging coming out around opportunities on price on per procedure price i think theres a big challenge for new entrants there which is what benefit do you bring at which price point so i think youre going to have to show benefit over laparoscopy what can be done that lap cant do and thats going to require some innovation and some technology and that technology is going to have to be paid for so i think over time folks are going to have to come out and show what it is that they plan to do to make that happen as we look at it i do think there are opportunities for intuitive to manage different price pints we have already in terms of our capital line and its also true in our instrument line and we can continue to do that so i think customers will have choice and the choice will be at what price point do they want to enter and what benefit and value do they find at that price point intuitive will offer multiple price points we will give them that opportunity we have already and we will continue to and what value they find at what price point will be their decision and theres so far been really just one or two companies who have been out there having those conversations and driving it i think we understand it reasonably well rick wise  stifel nicolaus  co inc appreciate the  perspective gary gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director next question please operator one moment and the next question is from the line of tao levy of wedbush securities please go ahead tao l levy  wedbush securities inc great thanks good afternoon your utilization per system in the us keeps on hitting new highs and so im just wondering where is the increase in capacity that the hospitals are finding where is that coming from are they utilizing the workweek schedules a little bit more effectively versus in prior years gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director hey tao tao l levy  wedbush securities inc hey gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director i think its more than one thing for me one is were seeing health systems integrated delivery networks optimizing the placement of their products and optimizing the flow of patients and surgeons around that product and so thats kind of an operational efficiency at the hospital level or health system level that has been driving it and i think its great its been great for our customers and we support it i think that the second thing is that some of the new procedure categories were coming into allow for higher volume of procedures and sign up single sites so more repeatable shorter durations give you higher utilization just kind of the nature of the mix of product thats coming in and lastly i think in some of the markets were seeing referral consolidations so lowvolume surgeons are referring to highervolume surgeons essentially passing patients to those who do more and that also drives up utilization so there are kind of multiple factors there that have supported the growth i dont know that it goes on forever i dont think theres infinite growth in utilization possible but so far so good tao l levy  wedbush securities inc got you and then just lastly the percent of your applicable procedures that are currently using the robotic vessel sealer or stapler do you have sort of a rough metric of where that stands today that you can share calvin darling  senior directorfinance investor relations yeah hey tao certainly we have seen growth in our vessel sealer and stapler adoption each quarter over the past few years and particularly in procedures where theres a high value associated with using those whether it be in colorectal resections even in some gynecologic procedures with vessel sealers theres still a lot of runway left and in particular as you think about the wide reloads that are only available on our xi and as the xi installed base becomes larger opening up more opportunities for those to be used in thoracic procedures theres going to be plenty of runway ahead as the installed base continues to move towards our newest technology tao l levy  wedbush securities inc you dont have like a procedure – im sorry a percent that you can share just to get a sense of how long that runway is gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director not at this time tao l levy  wedbush securities inc okay gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director operator well take one more question from one more questioner and operator okay thank you okay and the next question is from the line of richard newitter of leerink partners please go ahead rich s newitter  leerink partners llc hi thanks for squeezing me in i just had a quick one a followup on your table motion it sounds like that product is certainly graining traction and i was just curious to know is this feature being used in the way that you would have expected it to and what id really like to know is do you think or can you tell us what procedures or new incremental procedures does this potentially open for you or could you begin to see it open up where you arent already being used today thank you gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think that early experience has been that its well received particularly by multiquadrant general surgeons which is really where xi was positioned and one of the big motivations for table motion as frequently happens in this space something thats a fundamental capability thats good in one place tends to have application in others and i suspect well see that and as we get more data on it were happy to share it with you gary s guthart  president chief executive officer  director that was our last question as we said previously while we focus on financial metrics such as revenues profits and cash flows during these conference calls our organizational focus remains on increasing value by enabling surgeons to improve surgical outcomes and reduce surgical trauma we have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and i assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference this concludes todays call i thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking with you again in three months
