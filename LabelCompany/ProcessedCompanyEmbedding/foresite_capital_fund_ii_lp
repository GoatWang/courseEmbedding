zacks investment research aerie’s efforts on developing two latestage candidates – rhopressa and roclatan – are encouraging the company resubmitted new drug application nda for lead candidate rhopressa in feb  the fda determined that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review and set the pdufa goal date for the completion of review as feb   aerie had earlier withdrawn its nda that was filed in september as a third party manufacturing facility in tampa fl was not ready for preapproval inspection by the fda a potential approval and successful
