 edt first published on friday  june   edt a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible of the american classics densely arisen in the middle of the th century  hawthornes scarlet letter  melvilles mobydick  whitmans leaves of grass  to which we might add harriet beecher stowes uncle toms cabin  as a nationstirring bestseller and emersons essays as an indispensable preparation of the ground  walden has contributed most to americas present sense of itself in a time of informational overload of clamorously inane and ubiquitous electronic entertainment and of a fraught globally challenged ever more demanding workplace the urge to build a cabin in the woods and thus reform simplify and cleanse ones life  to front in thoreaus ringing verb only the essential facts of life  remains strong the holiday industry socalled thrives on it and camper sales and the weekend recourse to second homes in the northern forests or the western mountains where the pollutions of industry and commerce are relatively light simplify simplify walden advises and we try even though a stcentury attainment of a rustic elemental simplicity entails considerable complications of budget and transport thoreau would not scorn contemporary efforts to effect his gospel and follow his example walden aims at conversion and thoreaus polemical purpose gives it an energy and drive missing in the meanders of the sole other book he saw into publication during his short lifetime a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  a vigorous humorous tone asserts itself at the outset of walden i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they did not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent the circumstances a malaise of drudgery and petty distraction in the society around him are described and his general wish to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived however he passes over a very practical motive he wanted to be a writer and like many another of like ambition needed privacy quiet and a broad margin where his mind could roam he built a singleroom cabin on his mentor emersons land more than a mile south of concord village massachusetts in the spring of  and moved in on july  declaring his own independence in the next two years he completed a draft later expanded of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers based on a canoe trip he and his brother john had taken in  as well as composing the first draft of walden and a long essay on thomas carlyle part of which he gave as a lecture at the concord lyceum in  in july  he refused to pay his accumulated town poll taxes on the grounds that the national government condoned and protected slavery and spent one night in jail thus laying the basis for his celebrated essay civil disobedience later in that same year he travelled for the first time to maine and wrote most of the essay ktaadn thoreau was  when he took up residence in the cabin by walden pond he had graduated from harvard th in his class tried teaching helped his father in the family pencil business did local odd jobs for a dollar a day lived with the emersons for two years as handyman and gardener left long island after a brief spell of tutoring and testing the literary market and despite emersons sponsorship and a few poems and essays in the transcendentalist quarterly the dial had made no mark he emerged from the cabin in  as essentially the thoreau known to literary history his appearance was sufficiently arresting to have attracted a number of descriptions the fastidious but not unfriendly hawthorne a sometime resident of concord described him in  as a young man with much of wild original nature still remaining in him he is as ugly as sin longnosed queermouthed and with uncouth and somewhat rustic although courteous manners he seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilised men  an indian life i mean as respects the absence of any systematic effort for a livelihood james kendall hosmer recalled how an older thoreau stood in the doorway with hair which looked as if it had been dressed with a pinecone inattentive grey eyes hazy with faraway musings an emphatic nose and dishevelled attire that bore signs of tramps in woods and swamps his new bedford disciple daniel ricketson recalled as phrased by thoreaus biographer walter harding the gentleness humanity and intelligence of thoreaus blue eyes and noted that though his arms were long his legs short his hands and feet large and his shoulders markedly sloping he was strong and vigorous in his walk his voice was impressive even towards the end when tuberculosis had weakened it on his last journey a rather desperate excursion to minnesota for the possibly healing effects of its supposedly drier climate the minister upon whom he called in chicago the unitarian robert collyer remembered his words also were as distinct and true to the ear as those of a great singer he would hesitate for an instant now and then waiting for the right word or would pause with a pathetic patience to master the trouble in his chest but when he was through the sentence was perfect and entire lacking nothing and the word was so purely one with the man that when i read his books now and then i do not hear my own voice within my reading but the voice i heard that day how did thoreau achieve his literary voice which has worn better to a modern ear than emersons more fluent worldly and  to be expected from a former clergyman  oratorical one the mood of thoreau is more interior the eye is not on an audience but on a multitudinous world of sensation seen and named with precision consider these sentences from near the beginning of a week we glided noiselessly down the stream occasionally driving a pickerel from the covert of the pads or a bream from her nest and the smaller bittern now and then sailed away on sluggish wings from some recess in the shore or the larger lifted itself out of the long grass at our approach and carried its precious legs away to deposit them in a place of safety the tortoises also rapidly dropped into the water as our boat ruffled the surface amid the willows breaking the reflections of the trees the banks had passed the height of their beauty and some of the brighter flowers showed by their faded tints that the season was verging towards the afternoon of the year but this sombre tinge enhanced their sincerity and in the still unabated heats they seemed like the mossy brink of some cool well all is limpid observation gliding from one bittern to another until the startling remark that fading colour enhanced the flowers sincerity as if they have been pressing a case the long paragraph goes on to enumerate with the latin names the flowers of the concord meadows and ends with reminiscence of the mornings when the writer on the water before sunrise witnessed the sudden opening of water lilies to the touch of dawn sun when whole fields of white blossoms seemed to flash open before me as i floated along like the unfolding of a banner this is not exactly nature writing though it holds the freshness of a continent still being explored and catalogued as by a humboldt or an audubon it is a live particularised demonstration of emersons hopeful boast set forward in its most theological form in his slim first book nature  that every natural fact is a symbol of some spiritual fact  that nature is at bottom spirit that spirit alters moulds makes it emerson approvingly quoted swedenborgs the visible world and the relation of its parts is the dial plate of the invisible and asserted the axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics imbibing idealism from emerson thoreau soaked himself in natures great metaphor and became a scientist of sorts  a mystic a transcendentalist and a natural philosopher to boot he later called himself  and an autobiographer he gathered and transferred to journals amounting in the end to two million words rare moments and observations of increasing refinement and subtlety harvested where he would emerson like other respectable citizens of concord was sceptical of enterprise so personal and quizzical confiding to his journal that thoreau wants a little ambition in his mixture  instead of being the head of american engineers he is captain of a huckleberry party thoreaus taste for figurative huckleberrygathering took him far afield walking cape cods wavebeaten coast and ascending to the stony summit of maines mount ktaadn but he always returned to the little wilderness of concord a microcosm that was cosmos enough fo matthiessen in his american renaissance  points out how much the great writers of that renaissance owed to the english writers of the th century  donne and herbert marvell and browne  with their belief in correspondences between the little and the large the inner world of the self and the outer world of nature the heart of man donne wrote is an epitome of gods great book  of creatures and man need no farther look george herbert put it man is one world and hath  another to attend him thus extending nature into the unseen realms of heavenly solicitude by a great leap of kinship the metaphysicals of the th century ignited in the spiritual descendants of thcentury puritans a blaze of introspectively charged particulars walden lives in its particulars the long opening chapter economy joyously details just how to build a house  a tight shingled and plastered house ft wide by  long and ft posts with a garret and a closet a large window on each side two trap doors one door at the end and a brick fireplace opposite  down to a list of expenses totalling   briskly marketing to the world his programme of austerity and selfreliance he itemises the few foodstuffs he paid for and the profits he obtained from his seven miles of bean rows he tells us how to make his unleavened bread of rye and indian meal and a very good molasses either of pumpkin or beets in another experiment he eats a woodchuck enjoying it notwithstanding its musky flavour though he doubts it will become an item for the village butcher he shares the details of his housekeeping with us housework was a pleasant pastime when my floor was dirty i rose early and setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass bed and bedstead making but one budget dashed water on the floor and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white further  and this is a stroke of his sensitive pawky genius  he contemplates his momentarily displaced furniture and the nuance of enchanting strangeness it was pleasant to see my whole household effects out on the grass making a little pile like a gypsys pack and my threelegged table from which i did not remove the books and pen and ink standing amid the pines and hickories  it was worth the while to see the sun shine on these things and hear the free wind blow on them so much more interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in the house many things in thoreaus liberated state are worth the while to see  the feeding manners of chickadees and the trickles of spring thaw along the railroad cut resembling as you look down on them the laciniated lobed and imbricated thalluses of some lichens at the same moment he is cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are bearing off at other times he eavesdrops on the faint wiry peep of the baby woodcock being led by their mother through the swamp in walden s most bravura chapter sounds he hears not only the cries and rustles of myriad creatures but with surprising approval the whistle and racket of the fitchburg railroad train as it makes its way  rods off along the edge of walden pond commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene alert adventurous and unwearied it is very natural in its methods withal far more so than many fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments  i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odours all the way from long wharf to lake champlain the concord of the s where in thoreaus perception men lead lives of quiet desperation slavedrivers of themselves with no time to be any thing but a machine was by our lights a bucolic world the steam engine being the technological ultimate and the main labour farm labour it is the farmer according to thoreau whose poor immortal soul is well nigh crushed and smothered under its load creeping down the road of life pushing before it a barn ft by  its augean stables never cleansed it is a farmer he encounters in the middle of the night driving his livestock to a dawn appointment in boston while the unencumbered hermit returns to sleep in his cosy cabin thoreau was a harvard graduate and the scion of a small industrialist john thoreau the pencil manufacturer in the local social scale he was something of a gentleman and he asserts a gentlemans prerogative in pursuing his unprofitable hobbies we slightly wince on behalf of those more tightly bound to laborious necessity when we read that to maintain ones self on this earth is not hardship but a pastime if we will live simply and wisely and that by working about six weeks in a year i could meet all the expenses of living not everyone is offered free land to squat on for a personal experiment nor can draw so freely on the society of a nearby village thoreau makes light of most mens need to work and ignores the wave of industrial toil that was breaking upon new england thoreaus protest centres on the endproduct of industry the consumerism that urges us to buy its products  his proposed remedy is doing without a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone this includes doing without sex the generative energy which when we are loose dissipates and makes us unclean when we are continent invigorates and inspires us and would carry with it as hawthorne sensed an end to most of the interactions that form civilisation a return to indian life and beyond  to a degree of individual independence that no human society least of all a tribal one could tolerate his retreat to the cabin and the retreats to the land that his masterwork has helped inspire were luxuries financed by the surplus that an interwoven slavedriving economy generates even so staunch a thoreauvian as eb white whose own withdrawal to the maine coast was financed by the advertising revenues of a new york magazine in writing a tribute for walden s th anniversary  years ago admitted that the plodding economist will have rough going if he hopes to emerge from the book with a clear system of economic thought and that thoreau sometimes wrote as if all his readers were male unmarried and wellconnected but if it cannot be swallowed as a cureall walden can be relished as a condiment a flavouring a headclearing spice white remembering how the book heartened him when he read it in his youth saw walden as an invitation to lifes dance assuring the troubled recipient that the music is played for him too if he will but listen and move his feet love your life thoreau wrote poor as it is walden can be taken as an antidote to apathy and anxiety with its high spirits and keen appeals to the senses it fortifies its time of writing was a troubled time for thoreau young but old enough to have accomplished more and for the nation labouring under the cloud of the slavery issue and the coming civil war if thoreau did not make much of the industrial revolution he felt the crisis in belief whereby even the almost creedless stopgap of unitarianism demanded too much faith nature studies led to naturalism to philosophical materialism darwin the naturalist is cited early in walden as witness to those inhabitants of tierra del fuego who went naked with impunity while the european shivers in his clothes  model citizens of thoreaus utopia of doing without walter hardings biography the days of henry thoreau  tells us that the ailing thoreau lived to read in  darwins origin of species and took six pages of notes on it in one of his commonplace books and liked the book very much thoreau resembled darwin in his patient observations and benjamin franklin in his inventive practicality unlike most transcendentalists he could do things  tend garden and make home repairs for emerson or actualise with real carpentry bronson alcotts fanciful vision of a summerhouse i have as many trades as fingers he says in walden  between  and  he completed more than  surveys mostly in and around concord he figures in henry petroskis technological history of the pencil  the pencil  as the inventor not long after his graduation from harvard of a sevenfoothigh grinding machine that captured only the particles of graphite fine enough to rise highest into the air for a time thoreau pencils were the best  the least gritty  in america we trust the narrator of walden and his spiritual aspirations better because of repeated examples of his practical knowhow surviving in the woods he becomes a student of physical process the pond covered with winter ice moves him to minute inspection of bubbles narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long sharp cones with the apex upward in a warm spell they expand and run together often like silvery coins poured from a bag one overlapping another at the end of the passage he lifts his almost microscopic examination of the infinite number of minute bubbles into the resounding open these are the little airguns which contribute to make the ice crack and whoop he veers close to the secret of microorganisms when he asks why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid but frozen remains sweet forever the question evaporates however in the dry witticism it is commonly said that this is the difference between the affections and the intellect early in  thoreau seized the opportunity of a frozen walden to perform the chief technical labour of his years there with compass and chain and sounding line cutting holes in straight lines in several directions he sounds the pond presenting the reader with a drawn map  rods to an inch and a scale profile of the bottom the pond had been long rumoured to be bottomless it is remarkable how long men will believe in the bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it the surveyor is proud to announce i can assure my readers that walden has a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable though at an unusual depth ponds are shallower than we imagine most ponds emptied would leave a meadow no more hollow than we frequently see most mysteries by the same token yield to the emptying action of patient scientific examination readers new to walden may be surprised at the high proportion of its energy given to empirical exploration and demonstration the romantic naturecelebrant wears the polished spectacles of franklin and the philosophes thoreaus purpose is to reconcile us after centuries of hazy anthropocentricity to nature as it is relentless and remorseless we need to be called out from the shared comforts and illusions of village life we need the tonic of wildness we can never have enough of nature we must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigour vast and titanic features we need to witness our own limits transgressed and some life pasturing freely where we never wander we are cheered when we observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and disheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast on the path to his little cabin he relates there was a dead horse whose aroma repulsed him but heartened him with the assurance it gave me of the strong appetite and inviolable health of nature the vision of nature red in tooth and claw which desolated tennyson and other victorian christians is embraced by thoreau i love to see that nature is so rife with life that myriads can be afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another that tender organisations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like pulp  tadpoles which herons gobble up and tortoises and toads run over in the road and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood with the liability to accident we must see how little account is to be made of it the impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence compassion is a very untenable ground he sounds as it were the fatal bottom of our organic existence and yet claims not merely to accept the universe as another transcendentalist margaret fuller put it but to rejoice in it he met his own death at  of consumption with a serenity admired by much of concord one world at a time he famously told those seeking to prepare him for the next he did not quite renounce personal immortality a number of his phrases tease the possibility and near the passages above he evokes the wild river valley and the woods bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead concluding there needs no stronger proof of the immortality all things must live in such a light yet the meaning is unclear a fillip of animal optimism after a booklength cleareyed exaltation of nature as a chemical and molecular and mathematical construct  nature seized in the tightening grip of science and stripped of the pathetic fallacy even in the sophisticated form in which emersons neoplatonism couched it no more idealism no more platonic forms no shimmering archetypes having an existence somehow independent of individual things no ideas but in things william carlos williams would say in the next century giving modernism a motto the poetry of williams and eliot and pound demonstrated that things assembled even as enigmatic fragments as images without spelledout emotional and logical connectives give vitality to the language and immediacy to the communication between writer and reader it is the thinginess of thoreaus prose that still excites us the athleticism with which he springs from detail to detail image to image while still toting something of transcendentalisms metaphysical burden without that burden which is considerably lighter in the writings posthumously collected as the maine woods and cape cod he comes close to being merely an attentive and eloquent travel writer nevertheless the chaotic mistswept top of mount ktaadn  the raw materials of a planet dropped from an unseen quarry  and the wrecks and windstunted apple trees of cape cod afford us the metaphysical shudder of a man confronting in implacable nature an image of something purifyingly bleak within himself his later years as the preachments of abolitionists and slaveholders reached their shrill adumbration of bloody war were marked even made notorious by his fiery championing of john brown whom he had briefly met in concord finding him a man of great common sense deliberate and practical endowed with tact and prudence and the spartan habits and spare diet of a soldier the peaceable thoreau extols this grim killer for a practical reason brown has taken action violent action against the sanctioned violence of the slaveryprotecting state it was his peculiar doctrine that a man has a perfect right to interfere by force with the slaveholder in order to rescue the slave i agree with him i do not wish to kill nor to be killed but i can foresee circumstances in which both these things would be by me unavoidable we preserve the socalled peace of our community by deeds of petty violence every day thoreaus recognitions endeared him to the revolutionaries of the s he saw the violence behind the established order the enslaving nature of private property and  a trend even stronger now than  years ago  the medias substitution of the news for private reality shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths while reality is fabulous the word reality rings through walden  let us settle ourselves and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and slush of opinion and prejudice and tradition and delusion and appearance till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place which we can call reality  be it life or death we crave only reality if we are really dying let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the extremities if we are alive let us go about our business to the dark immensity of material natures indifference we can oppose only the brief light like a lamp in a cabin of our consciousness the invigorating benison of walden is to make us feel that the contest is equal and fair it has emerged over time as one of the great testaments of american individualism assuring the new world traditional reassurances failing of the value power and beauty of the unfettered self  john updike this is an edited extract from john updikes introduction to a new edition of walden by henry david thoreau published by princeton university press topics

george bernard shaw john zerzan signature henry david thoreau see name pronunciation july   – may   was an american essayist poet philosopher abolitionist naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor and historian a leading transcendentalist thoreau is best known for his book walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience originally published as resistance to civil government an argument for disobedience to an unjust state thoreaus books articles essays journals and poetry amount to more than  volumes among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history two sources of modernday environmentalism his literary style interweaves close observation of nature personal experience pointed rhetoric symbolic meanings and historical lore while displaying a poetic sensibility philosophical austerity and yankee attention to practical detail he was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements historical change and natural decay at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover lifes true essential needs he was a lifelong abolitionist delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of wendell phillips and defending the abolitionist john brown thoreaus philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jrcitation needed thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist though civil disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism that government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have contents  pronunciation of his name  physical appearance  life  early life and education –  return to concord –  civil disobedience and the walden years –

thuroh—ˈθʌroʊ—in general american but more precisely thoroh—ˈθɔːroʊ—in thcentury new england edward waldo emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced thórow with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable among modernday american speakers it is perhaps more commonly pronounced thəroh—θəˈroʊ—with stress on the second syllable physical appearanceedit thoreau was a homely man with a nose that he called my most prominent feature of his appearance and disposition ellery channing wrote his face once seen could not be forgotten the features were quite marked the nose aquiline or very roman like one of the portraits of caesar more like a beak as was said large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen in certain lights and in others gray—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling but never weak or nearsighted the forehead not unusually broad or high full of concentrated energy and purpose the mouth with prominent lips pursed up with meaning and thought when silent and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings lifeedit early life and education –edit thoreaus birthplace the wheelerminot farmhouse in concord henry david thoreau was born david henry thoreau in concord massachusetts into the modest new england family of john thoreau a pencil maker and cynthia dunbar his paternal grandfather was born in jersey his maternal grandfather asa dunbar led harvards  student butter rebellion the first recorded student protest in the american colonies david henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle david thoreau he began to call himself henry david after he finished college he never petitioned to make a legal name change he had two older siblings helen and john jr and a younger sister sophia thoreaus birthplace still exists on virginia road in concord the house has been restored by the thoreau farm trust a nonprofit organization and is now open to the public he studied at harvard college between  and  he lived in hollis hall and took courses in rhetoric classics philosophy mathematics and sciencecitation needed he was a member of the institute of  now the hasty pudding club according to legend thoreau refused to pay the fivedollar fee for a harvard diploma in fact the masters degree he declined to purchase had no academic merit harvard college offered it to graduates who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating and their saving earning or inheriting quality or condition by having five dollars to give the college he commented let every sheep keep its own skin a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas return to concord –edit the traditional professions open to college graduates—law the church business medicine—did not interest thoreau so in  he took a leave of absence from harvard during which he taught school in canton massachusetts after he graduated in  he joined the faculty of the concord public school but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment he and his brother john then opened the concord academy a grammar school in concord in  they introduced several progressive concepts including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses the school closed when john became fatally ill from tetanus in  after cutting himself while shaving he died in henrys arms upon graduation thoreau returned home to concord where he met ralph waldo emerson through a mutual friend emerson took a paternal and at times patronizing interest in thoreau advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers including ellery channing margaret fuller bronson alcott and nathaniel hawthorne and his son julian hawthorne who was a boy at the time emerson urged thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical the dial and lobbied the editor margaret fuller to publish those writings thoreaus first essay published in the dial was aulus persius flaccus an essay on the roman playwright in july  it consisted of revised passages from his journal which he had begun keeping at emersons suggestion the first journal entry on october   reads what are you doing now he asked do you keep a journal so i make my first entry today thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition in his early years he followed transcendentalism a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by emerson fuller and alcott they held that an ideal spiritual state transcends or goes beyond the physical and empirical and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine in their view nature is the outward sign of inward spirit expressing the radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts as emerson wrote in nature   us postage stamp honoring thoreau designed by leonard baskin on april   thoreau moved into the emerson house there from  to  he served as the childrens tutor he was also an editorial assistant repairman and gardener for a few months in  he moved to the home of william emerson on staten island and tutored the familys sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings including his future literary representative horace greeley thoreau returned to concord and worked in his familys pencil factory which he continued to do for most of his adult life he rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder this invention improved upon graphite found in new hampshire and bought in  by a relative charles dunbar the process of mixing graphite and clay known as the conté process was patented by nicolasjacques conté in  his other source had been tantiusques a mine operated by native americans in sturbridge massachusetts later thoreau converted the factory to produce plumbago graphite which was used in the electrotyping process once back in concord thoreau went through a restless period in april  he and his friend edward hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed  acres  km of walden woods civil disobedience and the walden years –edit thoreau sites at walden pond i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion — henry david thoreau where i lived and what i lived for in walden thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing in march  ellery channing told thoreau go out upon that build yourself a hut  there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive i see no other alternative no other hope for you two months later thoreau embarked on a twoyear experiment in simple living on july   when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by emerson in a secondgrowth forest around the shores of walden pond the house was in a pretty pasture and woodlot of  acres  m that emerson had bought  miles  km from his family home original title page of walden with an illustration from a drawing by thoreaus sister sophia on july  or july   thoreau ran into the local tax collector sam staples who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes thoreau refused because of his opposition to the mexican–american war and slavery and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal the next day thoreau was freed when someone likely to have been his aunt paid the tax against his wishes the experience had a strong impact on thoreau in january and february  he delivered lectures on the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government explaining his tax resistance at the concord lyceum bronson alcott attended the lecture writing in his journal on january  heard thoreaus lecture before the lyceum on the relation of the individual to the state—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to selfgovernment and an attentive audience his allusions to the mexican war to mr hoars expulsion from carolina his own imprisonment in concord jail for refusal to pay his tax mr hoars payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal were all pertinent well considered and reasoned i took great pleasure in this deed of thoreaus — bronson alcott  journals thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled resistance to civil government also known as civil disobedience it was published by elizabeth peabody in the aesthetic papers in may  thoreau had taken up a version of percy shelleys principle in the political poem the mask of anarchy  which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action at walden pond thoreau completed a first draft of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers an elegy to his brother john describing their trip to the white mountains in  thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed  copies at his own expense fewer than  were sold he selfpublished the book on the advice of emerson using emersons publisher munroe who did little to publicize the book reconstruction of the interior of thoreaus cabin replica of thoreaus cabin and a statue of him near walden pond in august  thoreau briefly left walden to make a trip to mount katahdin in maine a journey later recorded in ktaadn the first part of the maine woods thoreau left walden pond on september   at emersons request he immediately moved back to the emerson house to help emersons wife lidian manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to europe over several years as he worked to pay off his debts he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as walden or life in the woods in  recounting the two years two months and two days he had spent at walden pond the book compresses that time into a single calendar year using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development part memoir and part spiritual quest walden at first won few admirers but later critics have regarded it as a classic american work that explores natural simplicity harmony and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions the american poet robert frost wrote of thoreau in one book  he surpasses everything we have had in america the american author john updike said of the book a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible thoreau moved out of emersons house in july  and stayed at a house on nearby belknap street in  he and his family moved into a house at  main street where he lived until his death later years –edit thoreau in  in  thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition he read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal he admired william bartram and charles darwins voyage of the beagle he kept detailed observations on concords nature lore recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of walden pond and the days certain birds migrated the point of this task was to anticipate the seasons of nature in his word he became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town covering an area of  square miles  km in his journal a twomillionword document he kept for  years he also kept a series of notebooks and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history such as autumnal tints the succession of trees and wild apples an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species until the s literary criticswho dismissed thoreaus late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy with the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines several new readings of thoreau began to emerge showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots for instance his late essay the succession of forest trees shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals walden pond he traveled to quebec once cape cod four times and maine three times these landscapes inspired his excursion books a yankee in canada cape cod and the maine woods in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography history and philosophy other travels took him southwest to philadelphia and new york city in  and west across the great lakes region in  when he visited niagara falls detroit chicago milwaukee st paul and mackinac island he was provincial in his own travels but he read widely about travel in other lands he devoured all the firsthand travel accounts available in his day at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored he read magellan and james cook the arctic explorers john franklin alexander mackenzie and william parry david livingstone and richard francis burton on africa lewis and clark and hundreds of lesserknown works by explorers and literate travelers astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples cultures religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals he processed everything he read in the local laboratory of his concord experience among his famous aphorisms is his advice to live at home like a traveler after john browns raid on harpers ferry many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from brown or damned him with faint praise thoreau was disgusted by this and he composed a key speech a plea for captain john brown which was uncompromising in its defense of brown and his actions thoreaus speech proved persuasive the abolitionist movement began to accept brown as a martyr and by the time of the american civil war entire armies of the north were literally singing browns praises as a biographer of brown put it if as alfred kazin suggests without john brown there would have been no civil war we would add that without the concord transcendentalists john brown would have had little cultural impact thoreau in his second and final photographic sitting august  deathedit thoreau contracted tuberculosis in  and suffered from it sporadically afterwards in  following a latenight excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm he became ill with bronchitis his health declined with brief periods of remission and he eventually became bedridden recognizing the terminal nature of his disease thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works particularly the maine woods and excursions and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of a week and walden he wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue his friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death when his aunt louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with god thoreau responded i did not know we had ever quarreled grave of thoreau at sleepy hollow cemetery in concord aware he was dying thoreaus last words were now comes good sailing followed by two lone words moose and indian he died on may   at age  bronson alcott planned the service and read selections from thoreaus works and channing presented a hymn emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral thoreau was buried in the dunbar family plot his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to sleepy hollow cemetery °′″n °′″w﻿  ﻿°n °w﻿    in concord massachusetts thoreaus friend ellery channing published his first biography thoreau the poetnaturalist in  channing and another friend harrison blake edited some poems essays and journal entries for posthumous publication in the s thoreaus journals which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death were first published in  and helped to build his modern reputation a new expanded edition of the journals is under way published by princeton university press today thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost american writers both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics his memory is honored by the international thoreau society and his by the thoreau institute at walden woods established in  in lincoln massachusetts nature and human existenceedit most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind — thoreau thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing of conserving natural resources on private land and of preserving wilderness as public land he was himself a highly skilled canoeist nathaniel hawthorne after a ride with him noted that mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he was not a strict vegetarian though he said he preferred that diet and advocated it as a means of selfimprovement he wrote in walden the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth thoreaus famous quotation near his cabin site at walden pond thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness instead he sought a middle ground the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture his philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in north america he decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them the wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest and he preferred partially cultivated country his idea of being far in the recesses of the wilderness of maine was to travel the loggers path and the indian trail but he also hiked on pristine land in the essay henry david thoreau philosopher roderick nash wrote thoreau left concord in  for the first of three trips to northern maine his expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine primeval america but contact with real wilderness in maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in concord instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance of alcohol thoreau wrote i would fain keep sober always i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes sexualityedit thoreau never married and was childless he strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan however his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation including by his contemporaries critics have called him heterosexual homosexual or asexual there is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone man or woman some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual the elegy sympathy was inspired by the elevenyearold edmund sewell with whom he hiked for five days in  one scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to edmunds sister and another that thoreaus emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns but other scholars dismiss this it has been argued that the long paean in walden to the frenchcanadian woodchopper alek therien which includes allusions to achilles and patroclus is an expression of conflicted desire in some of thoreaus writing there is the sense of a secret self in  he writes in his journal my friend is the apology for my life in him are the spaces which my orbit traverses thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire politicsedit part of the politics series on green anarchism schools of thought anarchonaturism social ecology

topics anarchism anticapitalism anticonsumerism ecosocialism green politics libertarian socialism naturism anarchism portal environment portal politics portal v t e john brown treason broadside  thoreau was fervently against slavery and actively supported the abolitionist movement he participated in the underground railroad delivered lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law and in opposition with the popular opinion of the time supported radical abolitionist militia leader john brown and his party two weeks after the illfated raid on harpers ferry and in the weeks leading up to browns execution thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of concord massachusetts in which he compared the american government to pontius pilate and likened browns execution to the crucifixion of jesus christ some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light in the last days of john brown thoreau described the words and deeds of john brown as noble and an example of heroism in addition he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed brown and his scheme as crazy thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have through selfbetterment the kind of government which governs not at all he distanced himself from contemporary nogovernment men anarchists writing i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as a progress toward true respect for the individual and theorized about further improvements towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man echoing this belief he went on to write there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly although thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent exemplified in his support for john brown and nonviolent his own example of tax resistance displayed in resistance to civil government he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity writing let not our peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords or our inability to draw them from their scabbards but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp furthermore in a formal lyceum debate in  he debated the subject is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance arguing the affirmative likewise his condemnation of the mexican–american war did not stem from pacifism but rather because he considered mexico unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army as a means to expand the slave territory thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism on one hand he regarded commerce as unexpectedly confident and serene adventurous and unwearied and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism writing i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer on the other hand he wrote disparagingly of the factory system i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched thoreau also favored bioregionalism the protection of animals and wild areas free trade and taxation for schools and highways he disapproved of the subjugation of native americans slavery technological utopianism consumerism philistinism mass entertainment and frivolous applications of technology intellectual interests influences and affinitiesedit indian sacred texts and philosophyedit krishna teaching arjuna from bhagavata gita a text thoreau read at walden pond thoreau was influenced by indian spiritual thought in walden there are many overt references to the sacred texts of india for example in the first chapter economy he writes how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east american philosophy an encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of god as separate from the world also a characteristic of hinduism furthermore in the pond in winter he equates walden pond with the sacred ganges river writing in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the brahmin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges thoreau was aware his ganges imagery could have been factual he wrote about ice harvesting at walden pond and he knew that new englands ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports including calcutta additionally thoreau followed various hindu customs including following a diet of rice it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india flute playing reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of krishna and yoga in an  letter to his friend hgo blake he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him free in this world as the birds in the air disengaged from every kind of chains those who practice yoga gather in brahma the certain fruits of their works depend upon it that rude and careless as i am i would fain practice the yoga faithfully the yogi absorbed in contemplation contributes in his degree to creation he breathes a divine perfume he hears wonderful things divine forms traverse him without tearing him and united to the nature which is proper to him he goes he acts as animating original matter to some extent and at rare intervals even i am a yogi biologyedit bird eggs found by thoreau and given to the boston society of natural history those in the nest are of yellow warbler the other two of redtailed hawk thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology including the works of alexander von humboldt charles darwin and asa gray charles darwins staunchest american ally thoreau was deeply influenced by humboldt especially his work kosmos in  thoreau purchased and read darwins on the origin of species unlike many natural historians at the time including louis agassiz who publicly opposed darwinism in favor of a static view of nature thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it stating the development theory implies a greater vital force in nature because it is more flexible and accommodating and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation a quote from on the origin of species follows this sentence influenceedit a bust of thoreau from the hall of fame for great americans at the bronx community college thoreaus careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time becoming stronger as the weaknesses thoreau noted have become more pronounced  events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at walden pond have been influenced by it including the national park system the british labor movement the creation of india the civil rights movement the hippie revolution the environmental movement and the wilderness movement today thoreaus words are quoted with feeling by liberals socialists anarchists libertarians and conservatives alike — ken kifer analysis and notes on walden henry thoreaus text with adjacent thoreauvian commentary thoreaus political writings had little impact during his lifetime as his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical viewing him instead as a naturalist they either dismissed or ignored his political essays including civil disobedience the only two complete books as opposed to essays published in his lifetime walden and a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  both dealt with nature in which he loved to wander his obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an  yearbook nevertheless thoreaus writings went on to influence many public figures political leaders and reformers like mohandas gandhi us president john f kennedy american civil rights activist martin luther king jr us supreme court justice william o douglas and russian author leo tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by thoreaus work particularly civil disobedience as did rightwing theorist frank chodorov who devoted an entire issue of his monthly analysis to an appreciation of thoreau thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including edward abbey willa cather marcel proust william butler yeats sinclair lewis ernest hemingway upton sinclair e b white lewis mumford frank lloyd wright alexander posey and gustav stickley thoreau also influenced naturalists like john burroughs john muir e o wilson edwin way teale joseph wood krutch b f skinner david brower and loren eiseley whom publishers weekly called the modern thoreau english writer henry stephens salt wrote a biography of thoreau in  which popularized thoreaus ideas in britain george bernard shaw edward carpenter and robert blatchford were among those who became thoreau enthusiasts as a result of salts advocacy mohandas gandhi first read walden in  while working as a civil rights activist in johannesburg south africa he first read civil disobedience while he sat in a south african prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the indian population in the transvaal the essay galvanized gandhi who wrote and published a synopsis of thoreaus argument calling its incisive logic  unanswerable and referring to thoreau as one of the greatest and most moral men america has produced he told american reporter webb miller thoreaus ideas influenced me greatly i adopted some of them and recommended the study of thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of indian independence why i actually took the name of my movement from thoreaus essay on the duty of civil disobedience written about  years ago martin luther king jr noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading on civil disobedience in  while attending morehouse college he wrote in his autobiography that it was here in this courageous new englanders refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slaverys territory into mexico i made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system i was so deeply moved that i reread the work several times i became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good no other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than henry david thoreau as a result of his writings and personal witness we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest the teachings of thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement indeed they are more alive than ever before whether expressed in a sitin at lunch counters a freedom ride into mississippi a peaceful protest in albany georgia a bus boycott in montgomery alabama these are outgrowths of thoreaus insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice american psychologist b f skinner wrote that he carried a copy of thoreaus walden with him in his youth and in  wrote walden two a fictional utopia about  members of a community living together inspired by the life of thoreau thoreau and his fellow transcendentalists from concord were a major inspiration of the composer charles ives the th movement of the concord sonata for piano with a part for flute thoreaus instrument is a character picture and he also set thoreaus words actor ron thompson did a dramatic portrayal of henry david thoreau on the  nbc television series the rebels thoreaus ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement with emma goldman referring to him as the greatest american anarchist green anarchism and anarchoprimitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological pointsofview from the writings of thoreau john zerzan included thoreaus text excursions  in his edited compilation of works in the anarchoprimitivist tradition titled against civilization readings and reflections additionally murray rothbard the founder of anarchocapitalism has opined that thoreau was one of the great intellectual heroes of his movement thoreau was also an important influence on latethcentury anarchist naturism globally thoreaus concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france and portugal criticismedit although his writings would receive widespread acclaim thoreaus ideas were not universally applauded scottish author robert louis stevenson judged thoreaus endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of unmanly effeminacy and womanish solitude while deeming him a selfindulgent skulker nathaniel hawthorne had mixed feelings about thoreau he noted that he is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  on the other hand he also wrote that thoreau repudiated all regular modes of getting a living and seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilized men in a similar vein poet john greenleaf whittier detested what he deemed to be the wicked and heathenish message of walden claiming that thoreau wanted man to lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs in response to such criticisms english novelist george eliot writing for the westminster review characterized such critics as uninspired and narrowminded people—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every mans life ordered according to a particular pattern and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them may poohpooh mr thoreau and this episode in his history as unpractical and dreamy thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained  unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives  i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits recent criticism has accused thoreau of hypocrisy misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in walden although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective worksedit this list

zerzan signature henry david thoreau see name pronunciation july   – may   was an american essayist poet philosopher abolitionist naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor and historian a leading transcendentalist thoreau is best known for his book walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience originally published as resistance to civil government an argument for disobedience to an unjust state thoreaus books articles essays journals and poetry amount to more than  volumes among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history two sources of modernday environmentalism his literary style interweaves close observation of nature personal experience pointed rhetoric symbolic meanings and historical lore while displaying a poetic sensibility philosophical austerity and yankee attention to practical detail he was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements historical change and natural decay at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover lifes true essential needs he was a lifelong abolitionist delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of wendell phillips and defending the abolitionist john brown thoreaus philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jrcitation needed thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist though civil disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism that government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have

external links  texts pronunciation of his nameedit amos bronson alcott and thoreaus aunt each wrote that thoreau is pronounced like the word thorough pronounced thuroh—ˈθʌroʊ—in general american but more precisely thoroh—ˈθɔːroʊ—in thcentury new england edward waldo emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced thórow with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable among modernday american speakers it is perhaps more commonly pronounced thəroh—θəˈroʊ—with stress on the second syllable physical appearanceedit thoreau was a homely man with a nose that he called my most prominent feature of his appearance and disposition ellery channing wrote his face once seen could not be forgotten the features were quite marked the nose aquiline or very roman like one of the portraits of caesar more like a beak as was said large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen in certain lights and in others gray—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling but never weak or nearsighted the forehead not unusually broad or high full of concentrated energy and purpose the mouth with prominent lips pursed up with meaning and thought when silent and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings lifeedit early life and education –edit thoreaus birthplace the wheelerminot farmhouse in concord henry david thoreau was born david henry thoreau in concord massachusetts into the modest new england family of john thoreau a pencil maker and cynthia dunbar his paternal grandfather was born in jersey his maternal grandfather asa dunbar led harvards  student butter rebellion the first recorded student protest in the american colonies david henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle david thoreau he began to call himself henry david after he finished college he never petitioned to make a legal name change he had two older siblings helen and john jr and a younger sister sophia thoreaus birthplace still exists on virginia road in concord the house has been restored by the thoreau farm trust a nonprofit organization and is now open to the public he studied at harvard college between  and  he lived in hollis hall and took courses in rhetoric classics philosophy mathematics and sciencecitation needed he was a member of the institute of  now the hasty pudding club according to legend thoreau refused to pay the fivedollar fee for a harvard diploma in fact the masters degree he declined to purchase had no academic merit harvard college offered it to graduates who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating and their saving earning or inheriting quality or condition by having five dollars to give the college he commented let every sheep keep its own skin a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas return to concord –edit the traditional professions open to college graduates—law the church business medicine—did not interest thoreau so in  he took a leave of absence from harvard during which he taught school in canton massachusetts after he graduated in  he joined the faculty of the concord public school but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment he and his brother john then opened the concord academy a grammar school in concord in  they introduced several progressive concepts including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses the school closed when john became fatally ill from tetanus in  after cutting himself while shaving he died in henrys arms upon graduation thoreau returned home to concord where he met ralph waldo emerson through a mutual friend emerson took a paternal and at times patronizing interest in thoreau advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers including ellery channing margaret fuller bronson alcott and nathaniel hawthorne and his son julian hawthorne who was a boy at the time emerson urged thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical the dial and lobbied the editor margaret fuller to publish those writings thoreaus first essay published in the dial was aulus persius flaccus an essay on the roman playwright in july  it consisted of revised passages from his journal which he had begun keeping at emersons suggestion the first journal entry on october   reads what are you doing now he asked do you keep a journal so i make my first entry today thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition in his early years he followed transcendentalism a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by emerson fuller and alcott they held that an ideal spiritual state transcends or goes beyond the physical and empirical and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine in their view nature is the outward sign of inward spirit expressing the radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts as emerson wrote in nature   us postage stamp honoring thoreau designed by leonard baskin on april   thoreau moved into the emerson house there from  to  he served as the childrens tutor he was also an editorial assistant repairman and gardener for a few months in  he moved to the home of william emerson on staten island and tutored the familys sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings including his future literary representative horace greeley thoreau returned to concord and worked in his familys pencil factory which he continued to do for most of his adult life he rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder this invention improved upon graphite found in new hampshire and bought in  by a relative charles dunbar the process of mixing graphite and clay known as the conté process was patented by nicolasjacques conté in  his other source had been tantiusques a mine operated by native americans in sturbridge massachusetts later thoreau converted the factory to produce plumbago graphite which was used in the electrotyping process once back in concord thoreau went through a restless period in april  he and his friend edward hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed  acres  km of walden woods civil disobedience and the walden years –edit thoreau sites at walden pond i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion — henry david thoreau where i lived and what i lived for in walden thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing in march  ellery channing told thoreau go out upon that build yourself a hut  there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive i see no other alternative no other hope for you two months later thoreau embarked on a twoyear experiment in simple living on july   when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by emerson in a secondgrowth forest around the shores of walden pond the house was in a pretty pasture and woodlot of  acres  m that emerson had bought  miles  km from his family home original title page of walden with an illustration from a drawing by thoreaus sister sophia on july  or july   thoreau ran into the local tax collector sam staples who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes thoreau refused because of his opposition to the mexican–american war and slavery and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal the next day thoreau was freed when someone likely to have been his aunt paid the tax against his wishes the experience had a strong impact on thoreau in january and february  he delivered lectures on the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government explaining his tax resistance at the concord lyceum bronson alcott attended the lecture writing in his journal on january  heard thoreaus lecture before the lyceum on the relation of the individual to the state—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to selfgovernment and an attentive audience his allusions to the mexican war to mr hoars expulsion from carolina his own imprisonment in concord jail for refusal to pay his tax mr hoars payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal were all pertinent well considered and reasoned i took great pleasure in this deed of thoreaus — bronson alcott  journals thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled resistance to civil government also known as civil disobedience it was published by elizabeth peabody in the aesthetic papers in may  thoreau had taken up a version of percy shelleys principle in the political poem the mask of anarchy  which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action at walden pond thoreau completed a first draft of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers an elegy to his brother john describing their trip to the white mountains in  thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed  copies at his own expense fewer than  were sold he selfpublished the book on the advice of emerson using emersons publisher munroe who did little to publicize the book reconstruction of the interior of thoreaus cabin replica of thoreaus cabin and a statue of him near walden pond in august  thoreau briefly left walden to make a trip to mount katahdin in maine a journey later recorded in ktaadn the first part of the maine woods thoreau left walden pond on september   at emersons request he immediately moved back to the emerson house to help emersons wife lidian manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to europe over several years as he worked to pay off his debts he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as walden or life in the woods in  recounting the two years two months and two days he had spent at walden pond the book compresses that time into a single calendar year using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development part memoir and part spiritual quest walden at first won few admirers but later critics have regarded it as a classic american work that explores natural simplicity harmony and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions the american poet robert frost wrote of thoreau in one book  he surpasses everything we have had in america the american author john updike said of the book a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible thoreau moved out of emersons house in july  and stayed at a house on nearby belknap street in  he and his family moved into a house at  main street where he lived until his death later years –edit thoreau in  in  thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition he read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal he admired william bartram and charles darwins voyage of the beagle he kept detailed observations on concords nature lore recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of walden pond and the days certain birds migrated the point of this task was to anticipate the seasons of nature in his word he became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town covering an area of  square miles  km in his journal a twomillionword document he kept for  years he also kept a series of notebooks and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history such as autumnal tints the succession of trees and wild apples an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species until the s literary criticswho dismissed thoreaus late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy with the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines several new readings of thoreau began to emerge showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots for instance his late essay the succession of forest trees shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals walden pond he traveled to quebec once cape cod four times and maine three times these landscapes inspired his excursion books a yankee in canada cape cod and the maine woods in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography history and philosophy other travels took him southwest to philadelphia and new york city in  and west across the great lakes region in  when he visited niagara falls detroit chicago milwaukee st paul and mackinac island he was provincial in his own travels but he read widely about travel in other lands he devoured all the firsthand travel accounts available in his day at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored he read magellan and james cook the arctic explorers john franklin alexander mackenzie and william parry david livingstone and richard francis burton on africa lewis and clark and hundreds of lesserknown works by explorers and literate travelers astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples cultures religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals he processed everything he read in the local laboratory of his concord experience among his famous aphorisms is his advice to live at home like a traveler after john browns raid on harpers ferry many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from brown or damned him with faint praise thoreau was disgusted by this and he composed a key speech a plea for captain john brown which was uncompromising in its defense of brown and his actions thoreaus speech proved persuasive the abolitionist movement began to accept brown as a martyr and by the time of the american civil war entire armies of the north were literally singing browns praises as a biographer of brown put it if as alfred kazin suggests without john brown there would have been no civil war we would add that without the concord transcendentalists john brown would have had little cultural impact thoreau in his second and final photographic sitting august  deathedit thoreau contracted tuberculosis in  and suffered from it sporadically afterwards in  following a latenight excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm he became ill with bronchitis his health declined with brief periods of remission and he eventually became bedridden recognizing the terminal nature of his disease thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works particularly the maine woods and excursions and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of a week and walden he wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue his friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death when his aunt louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with god thoreau responded i did not know we had ever quarreled grave of thoreau at sleepy hollow cemetery in concord aware he was dying thoreaus last words were now comes good sailing followed by two lone words moose and indian he died on may   at age  bronson alcott planned the service and read selections from thoreaus works and channing presented a hymn emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral thoreau was buried in the dunbar family plot his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to sleepy hollow cemetery °′″n °′″w﻿  ﻿°n °w﻿    in concord massachusetts thoreaus friend ellery channing published his first biography thoreau the poetnaturalist in  channing and another friend harrison blake edited some poems essays and journal entries for posthumous publication in the s thoreaus journals which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death were first published in  and helped to build his modern reputation a new expanded edition of the journals is under way published by princeton university press today thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost american writers both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics his memory is honored by the international thoreau society and his by the thoreau institute at walden woods established in  in lincoln massachusetts nature and human existenceedit most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind — thoreau thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing of conserving natural resources on private land and of preserving wilderness as public land he was himself a highly skilled canoeist nathaniel hawthorne after a ride with him noted that mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he was not a strict vegetarian though he said he preferred that diet and advocated it as a means of selfimprovement he wrote in walden the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth thoreaus famous quotation near his cabin site at walden pond thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness instead he sought a middle ground the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture his philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in north america he decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them the wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest and he preferred partially cultivated country his idea of being far in the recesses of the wilderness of maine was to travel the loggers path and the indian trail but he also hiked on pristine land in the essay henry david thoreau philosopher roderick nash wrote thoreau left concord in  for the first of three trips to northern maine his expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine primeval america but contact with real wilderness in maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in concord instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance of alcohol thoreau wrote i would fain keep sober always i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes sexualityedit thoreau never married and was childless he strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan however his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation including by his contemporaries critics have called him heterosexual homosexual or asexual there is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone man or woman some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual the elegy sympathy was inspired by the elevenyearold edmund sewell with whom he hiked for five days in  one scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to edmunds sister and another that thoreaus emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns but other scholars dismiss this it has been argued that the long paean in walden to the frenchcanadian woodchopper alek therien which includes allusions to achilles and patroclus is an expression of conflicted desire in some of thoreaus writing there is the sense of a secret self in  he writes in his journal my friend is the apology for my life in him are the spaces which my orbit traverses thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time and this may have instilled

ecosocialism green politics libertarian socialism naturism anarchism portal environment portal politics portal v t e john brown treason broadside  thoreau was fervently against slavery and actively supported the abolitionist movement he participated in the underground railroad delivered lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law and in opposition with the popular opinion of the time supported radical abolitionist militia leader john brown and his party two weeks after the illfated raid on harpers ferry and in the weeks leading up to browns execution thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of concord massachusetts in which he compared the american government to pontius pilate and likened browns execution to the crucifixion of jesus christ some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light in the last days of john brown thoreau described the words and deeds of john brown as noble and an example of heroism in addition he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed brown and his scheme as crazy thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have through selfbetterment the kind of government which governs not at all he distanced himself from contemporary nogovernment men anarchists writing i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as a progress toward true respect for the individual and theorized about further improvements towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man echoing this belief he went on to write there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly although thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent exemplified in his support for john brown and nonviolent his own example of tax resistance displayed in resistance to civil government he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity writing let not our peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords or our inability to draw them from their scabbards but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp furthermore in a formal lyceum debate in  he debated the subject is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance arguing the affirmative likewise his condemnation of the mexican–american war did not stem from pacifism but rather because he considered mexico unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army as a means to expand the slave territory thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism on one hand he regarded commerce as unexpectedly confident and serene adventurous and unwearied and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism writing i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer on the other hand he wrote disparagingly of the factory system i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched thoreau also favored bioregionalism the protection of animals and wild areas free trade and taxation for schools and highways he disapproved of the subjugation of native americans slavery technological utopianism consumerism philistinism mass entertainment and frivolous applications of technology intellectual interests influences and affinitiesedit indian sacred texts and philosophyedit krishna teaching arjuna from bhagavata gita a text thoreau read at walden pond thoreau was influenced by indian spiritual thought in walden there are many overt references to the sacred texts of india for example in the first chapter economy he writes how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east american philosophy an encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of god as separate from the world also a characteristic of hinduism furthermore in the pond in winter he equates walden pond with the sacred ganges river writing in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the brahmin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges thoreau was aware his ganges imagery could have been factual he wrote about ice harvesting at walden pond and he knew that new englands ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports including calcutta additionally thoreau followed various hindu customs including following a diet of rice it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india flute playing reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of krishna and yoga in an  letter to his friend hgo blake he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him free in this world as the birds in the air disengaged from every kind of chains those who practice yoga gather in brahma the certain fruits of their works depend upon it that rude and careless as i am i would fain practice the yoga faithfully the yogi absorbed in contemplation contributes in his degree to creation he breathes a divine perfume he hears wonderful things divine forms traverse him without tearing him and united to the nature which is proper to him he goes he acts as animating original matter to some extent and at rare intervals even i am a yogi biologyedit bird eggs found by thoreau and given to the boston society of natural history those in the nest are of yellow warbler the other two of redtailed hawk thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology including the works of alexander von humboldt charles darwin and asa gray charles darwins staunchest american ally thoreau was deeply influenced by humboldt especially his work kosmos in  thoreau purchased and read darwins on the origin of species unlike many natural historians at the time including louis agassiz who publicly opposed darwinism in favor of a static view of nature thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it stating the development theory implies a greater vital force in nature because it is more flexible and accommodating and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation a quote from on the origin of species follows this sentence influenceedit a bust of thoreau from the hall of fame for great americans at the bronx community college thoreaus careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time becoming stronger as the weaknesses thoreau noted have become more pronounced  events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at walden pond have been influenced by it including the national park system the british labor movement the creation of india the civil rights movement the hippie revolution the environmental movement and the wilderness movement today thoreaus words are quoted with feeling by liberals socialists anarchists libertarians and conservatives alike — ken kifer analysis and notes on walden henry thoreaus text with adjacent thoreauvian commentary thoreaus political writings had little impact during his lifetime as his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical viewing him instead as a naturalist they either dismissed or ignored his political essays including civil disobedience the only two complete books as opposed to essays published in his lifetime walden and a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  both dealt with nature in which he loved to wander his obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an  yearbook nevertheless thoreaus writings went on to influence many public figures political leaders and reformers like mohandas gandhi us president john f kennedy american civil rights activist martin luther king jr us supreme court justice william o douglas and russian author leo tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by thoreaus work particularly civil disobedience as did rightwing theorist frank chodorov who devoted an entire issue of his monthly analysis to an appreciation of thoreau thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including edward abbey willa cather marcel proust william butler yeats sinclair lewis ernest hemingway upton sinclair e b white lewis mumford frank lloyd wright alexander posey and gustav stickley thoreau also influenced naturalists like john burroughs john muir e o wilson edwin way teale joseph wood krutch b f skinner david brower and loren eiseley whom publishers weekly called the modern thoreau english writer henry stephens salt wrote a biography of thoreau in  which popularized thoreaus ideas in britain george bernard shaw edward carpenter and robert blatchford were among those who became thoreau enthusiasts as a result of salts advocacy mohandas gandhi first read walden in  while working as a civil rights activist in johannesburg south africa he first read civil disobedience while he sat in a south african prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the indian population in the transvaal the essay galvanized gandhi who wrote and published a synopsis of thoreaus argument calling its incisive logic  unanswerable and referring to thoreau as one of the greatest and most moral men america has produced he told american reporter webb miller thoreaus ideas influenced me greatly i adopted some of them and recommended the study of thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of indian independence why i actually took the name of my movement from thoreaus essay on the duty of civil disobedience written about  years ago martin luther king jr noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading on civil disobedience in  while attending morehouse college he wrote in his autobiography that it was here in this courageous new englanders refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slaverys territory into mexico i made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system i was so deeply moved that i reread the work several times i became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good no other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than henry david thoreau as a result of his writings and personal witness we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest the teachings of thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement indeed they are more alive than ever before whether expressed in a sitin at lunch counters a freedom ride into mississippi a peaceful protest in albany georgia a bus boycott in montgomery alabama these are outgrowths of thoreaus insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice american psychologist b f skinner wrote that he carried a copy of thoreaus walden with him in his youth and in  wrote walden two a fictional utopia about  members of a community living together inspired by the life of thoreau thoreau and his fellow transcendentalists from concord were a major inspiration of the composer charles ives the th movement of the concord sonata for piano with a part for flute thoreaus instrument is a character picture and he also set thoreaus words actor ron thompson did a dramatic portrayal of henry david thoreau on the  nbc television series the rebels thoreaus ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement with emma goldman referring to him as the greatest american anarchist green anarchism and anarchoprimitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological pointsofview from the writings of thoreau john zerzan included thoreaus text excursions  in his edited compilation of works in the anarchoprimitivist tradition titled against civilization readings and reflections additionally murray rothbard the founder of anarchocapitalism has opined that thoreau was one of the great intellectual heroes of his movement thoreau was also an important influence on latethcentury anarchist naturism globally thoreaus concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france and portugal criticismedit although his writings would receive widespread acclaim thoreaus ideas were not universally applauded scottish author robert louis stevenson judged thoreaus endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of unmanly effeminacy and womanish solitude while deeming him a selfindulgent skulker nathaniel hawthorne had mixed feelings about thoreau he noted that he is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  on the other hand he also wrote that thoreau repudiated all regular modes of getting a living and seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilized men in a similar vein poet john greenleaf whittier detested what he deemed to be the wicked and heathenish message of walden claiming that thoreau wanted man to lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs in response to such criticisms english novelist george eliot writing for the westminster review characterized such critics as uninspired and narrowminded people—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every mans life ordered according to a particular pattern and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them may poohpooh mr thoreau and this episode in his history as unpractical and dreamy thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained  unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives  i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits recent criticism has accused thoreau of hypocrisy misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in walden although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective worksedit this list is incomplete you can help by expanding it henry david thoreau core works and topics civil disobedience herald of freedom the

zerzan signature henry david thoreau see name pronunciation july   – may   was an american essayist poet philosopher abolitionist naturalist tax resister development critic surveyor and historian a leading transcendentalist thoreau is best known for his book walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience originally published as resistance to civil government an argument for disobedience to an unjust state thoreaus books articles essays journals and poetry amount to more than  volumes among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history two sources of modernday environmentalism his literary style interweaves close observation of nature personal experience pointed rhetoric symbolic meanings and historical lore while displaying a poetic sensibility philosophical austerity and yankee attention to practical detail he was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements historical change and natural decay at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover lifes true essential needs he was a lifelong abolitionist delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of wendell phillips and defending the abolitionist john brown thoreaus philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jrcitation needed thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist though civil disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism that government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have

external links  texts pronunciation of his nameedit amos bronson alcott and thoreaus aunt each wrote that thoreau is pronounced like the word thorough pronounced thuroh—ˈθʌroʊ—in general american but more precisely thoroh—ˈθɔːroʊ—in thcentury new england edward waldo emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced thórow with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable among modernday american speakers it is perhaps more commonly pronounced thəroh—θəˈroʊ—with stress on the second syllable physical appearanceedit thoreau was a homely man with a nose that he called my most prominent feature of his appearance and disposition ellery channing wrote his face once seen could not be forgotten the features were quite marked the nose aquiline or very roman like one of the portraits of caesar more like a beak as was said large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen in certain lights and in others gray—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling but never weak or nearsighted the forehead not unusually broad or high full of concentrated energy and purpose the mouth with prominent lips pursed up with meaning and thought when silent and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings lifeedit early life and education –edit thoreaus birthplace the wheelerminot farmhouse in concord henry david thoreau was born david henry thoreau in concord massachusetts into the modest new england family of john thoreau a pencil maker and cynthia dunbar his paternal grandfather was born in jersey his maternal grandfather asa dunbar led harvards  student butter rebellion the first recorded student protest in the american colonies david henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle david thoreau he began to call himself henry david after he finished college he never petitioned to make a legal name change he had two older siblings helen and john jr and a younger sister sophia thoreaus birthplace still exists on virginia road in concord the house has been restored by the thoreau farm trust a nonprofit organization and is now open to the public he studied at harvard college between  and  he lived in hollis hall and took courses in rhetoric classics philosophy mathematics and sciencecitation needed he was a member of the institute of  now the hasty pudding club according to legend thoreau refused to pay the fivedollar fee for a harvard diploma in fact the masters degree he declined to purchase had no academic merit harvard college offered it to graduates who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating and their saving earning or inheriting quality or condition by having five dollars to give the college he commented let every sheep keep its own skin a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas return to concord –edit the traditional professions open to college graduates—law the church business medicine—did not interest thoreau so in  he took a leave of absence from harvard during which he taught school in canton massachusetts after he graduated in  he joined the faculty of the concord public school but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment he and his brother john then opened the concord academy a grammar school in concord in  they introduced several progressive concepts including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses the school closed when john became fatally ill from tetanus in  after cutting himself while shaving he died in henrys arms upon graduation thoreau returned home to concord where he met ralph waldo emerson through a mutual friend emerson took a paternal and at times patronizing interest in thoreau advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers including ellery channing margaret fuller bronson alcott and nathaniel hawthorne and his son julian hawthorne who was a boy at the time emerson urged thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical the dial and lobbied the editor margaret fuller to publish those writings thoreaus first essay published in the dial was aulus persius flaccus an essay on the roman playwright in july  it consisted of revised passages from his journal which he had begun keeping at emersons suggestion the first journal entry on october   reads what are you doing now he asked do you keep a journal so i make my first entry today thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition in his early years he followed transcendentalism a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by emerson fuller and alcott they held that an ideal spiritual state transcends or goes beyond the physical and empirical and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine in their view nature is the outward sign of inward spirit expressing the radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts as emerson wrote in nature   us postage stamp honoring thoreau designed by leonard baskin on april   thoreau moved into the emerson house there from  to  he served as the childrens tutor he was also an editorial assistant repairman and gardener for a few months in  he moved to the home of william emerson on staten island and tutored the familys sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings including his future literary representative horace greeley thoreau returned to concord and worked in his familys pencil factory which he continued to do for most of his adult life he rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder this invention improved upon graphite found in new hampshire and bought in  by a relative charles dunbar the process of mixing graphite and clay known as the conté process was patented by nicolasjacques conté in  his other source had been tantiusques a mine operated by native americans in sturbridge massachusetts later thoreau converted the factory to produce plumbago graphite which was used in the electrotyping process once back in concord thoreau went through a restless period in april  he and his friend edward hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed  acres  km of walden woods civil disobedience and the walden years –edit thoreau sites at walden pond i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion — henry david thoreau where i lived and what i lived for in walden thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing in march  ellery channing told thoreau go out upon that build yourself a hut  there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive i see no other alternative no other hope for you two months later thoreau embarked on a twoyear experiment in simple living on july   when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by emerson in a secondgrowth forest around the shores of walden pond the house was in a pretty pasture and woodlot of  acres  m that emerson had bought  miles  km from his family home original title page of walden with an illustration from a drawing by thoreaus sister sophia on july  or july   thoreau ran into the local tax collector sam staples who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes thoreau refused because of his opposition to the mexican–american war and slavery and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal the next day thoreau was freed when someone likely to have been his aunt paid the tax against his wishes the experience had a strong impact on thoreau in january and february  he delivered lectures on the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government explaining his tax resistance at the concord lyceum bronson alcott attended the lecture writing in his journal on january  heard thoreaus lecture before the lyceum on the relation of the individual to the state—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to selfgovernment and an attentive audience his allusions to the mexican war to mr hoars expulsion from carolina his own imprisonment in concord jail for refusal to pay his tax mr hoars payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal were all pertinent well considered and reasoned i took great pleasure in this deed of thoreaus — bronson alcott  journals thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled resistance to civil government also known as civil disobedience it was published by elizabeth peabody in the aesthetic papers in may  thoreau had taken up a version of percy shelleys principle in the political poem the mask of anarchy  which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action at walden pond thoreau completed a first draft of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers an elegy to his brother john describing their trip to the white mountains in  thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed  copies at his own expense fewer than  were sold he selfpublished the book on the advice of emerson using emersons publisher munroe who did little to publicize the book reconstruction of the interior of thoreaus cabin replica of thoreaus cabin and a statue of him near walden pond in august  thoreau briefly left walden to make a trip to mount katahdin in maine a journey later recorded in ktaadn the first part of the maine woods thoreau left walden pond on september   at emersons request he immediately moved back to the emerson house to help emersons wife lidian manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to europe over several years as he worked to pay off his debts he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as walden or life in the woods in  recounting the two years two months and two days he had spent at walden pond the book compresses that time into a single calendar year using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development part memoir and part spiritual quest walden at first won few admirers but later critics have regarded it as a classic american work that explores natural simplicity harmony and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions the american poet robert frost wrote of thoreau in one book  he surpasses everything we have had in america the american author john updike said of the book a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible thoreau moved out of emersons house in july  and stayed at a house on nearby belknap street in  he and his family moved into a house at  main street where he lived until his death later years –edit thoreau in  in  thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition he read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal he admired william bartram and charles darwins voyage of the beagle he kept detailed observations on concords nature lore recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of walden pond and the days certain birds migrated the point of this task was to anticipate the seasons of nature in his word he became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town covering an area of  square miles  km in his journal a twomillionword document he kept for  years he also kept a series of notebooks and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history such as autumnal tints the succession of trees and wild apples an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species until the s literary criticswho dismissed thoreaus late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy with the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines several new readings of thoreau began to emerge showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots for instance his late essay the succession of forest trees shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals walden pond he traveled to quebec once cape cod four times and maine three times these landscapes inspired his excursion books a yankee in canada cape cod and the maine woods in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography history and philosophy other travels took him southwest to philadelphia and new york city in  and west across the great lakes region in  when he visited niagara falls detroit chicago milwaukee st paul and mackinac island he was provincial in his own travels but he read widely about travel in other lands he devoured all the firsthand travel accounts available in his day at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored he read magellan and james cook the arctic explorers john franklin alexander mackenzie and william parry david livingstone and richard francis burton on africa lewis and clark and hundreds of lesserknown works by explorers and literate travelers astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples cultures religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals he processed everything he read in the local laboratory of his concord experience among his famous aphorisms is his advice to live at home like a traveler after john browns raid on harpers ferry many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from brown or damned him with faint praise thoreau was disgusted by this and he composed a key speech a plea for captain john brown which was uncompromising in its defense of brown and his actions thoreaus speech proved persuasive the abolitionist movement began to accept brown as a martyr and by the time of the american civil war entire armies of the north were literally singing browns praises as a biographer of brown put it if as alfred kazin suggests without john brown there would have been no civil war we would add that without the concord transcendentalists john brown would have had little cultural impact thoreau in his second and final photographic sitting august  deathedit thoreau contracted tuberculosis in  and suffered from it sporadically afterwards in  following a latenight excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm he became ill with bronchitis his health declined with brief periods of remission and he eventually became bedridden recognizing the terminal nature of his disease thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works particularly the maine woods and excursions and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of a week and walden he wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue his friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death when his aunt louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with god thoreau responded i did not know we had ever quarreled grave of thoreau at sleepy hollow cemetery in concord aware he was dying thoreaus last words were now comes good sailing followed by two lone words moose and indian he died on may   at age  bronson alcott planned the service and read selections from thoreaus works and channing presented a hymn emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral thoreau was buried in the dunbar family plot his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to sleepy hollow cemetery °′″n °′″w﻿  ﻿°n °w﻿    in concord massachusetts thoreaus friend ellery channing published his first biography thoreau the poetnaturalist in  channing and another friend harrison blake edited some poems essays and journal entries for posthumous publication in the s thoreaus journals which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death were first published in  and helped to build his modern reputation a new expanded edition of the journals is under way published by princeton university press today thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost american writers both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics his memory is honored by the international thoreau society and his by the thoreau institute at walden woods established in  in lincoln massachusetts nature and human existenceedit most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind — thoreau thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing of conserving natural resources on private land and of preserving wilderness as public land he was himself a highly skilled canoeist nathaniel hawthorne after a ride with him noted that mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he was not a strict vegetarian though he said he preferred that diet and advocated it as a means of selfimprovement he wrote in walden the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth thoreaus famous quotation near his cabin site at walden pond thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness instead he sought a middle ground the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture his philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in north america he decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them the wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest and he preferred partially cultivated country his idea of being far in the recesses of the wilderness of maine was to travel the loggers path and the indian trail but he also hiked on pristine land in the essay henry david thoreau philosopher roderick nash wrote thoreau left concord in  for the first of three trips to northern maine his expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine primeval america but contact with real wilderness in maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in concord instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance of alcohol thoreau wrote i would fain keep sober always i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes sexualityedit thoreau never married and was childless he strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan however his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation including by his contemporaries critics have called him heterosexual homosexual or asexual there is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone man or woman some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual the elegy sympathy was inspired by the elevenyearold edmund sewell with whom he hiked for five days in  one scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to edmunds sister and another that thoreaus emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns but other scholars dismiss this it has been argued that the long paean in walden to the frenchcanadian woodchopper alek therien which includes allusions to achilles and patroclus is an expression of conflicted desire in some of thoreaus writing there is the sense of a secret self in  he writes in his journal my friend is the apology for my life in him are the spaces which my orbit traverses thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire politicsedit part of the politics series on green anarchism schools of thought anarchonaturism social ecology anarchoprimitivism veganarchism theory and practice

ecosocialism green politics libertarian socialism naturism anarchism portal environment portal politics portal v t e john brown treason broadside  thoreau was fervently against slavery and actively supported the abolitionist movement he participated in the underground railroad delivered lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law and in opposition with the popular opinion of the time supported radical abolitionist militia leader john brown and his party two weeks after the illfated raid on harpers ferry and in the weeks leading up to browns execution thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of concord massachusetts in which he compared the american government to pontius pilate and likened browns execution to the crucifixion of jesus christ some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light in the last days of john brown thoreau described the words and deeds of john brown as noble and an example of heroism in addition he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed brown and his scheme as crazy thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have through selfbetterment the kind of government which governs not at all he distanced himself from contemporary nogovernment men anarchists writing i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as a progress toward true respect for the individual and theorized about further improvements towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man echoing this belief he went on to write there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly although thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent exemplified in his support for john brown and nonviolent his own example of tax resistance displayed in resistance to civil government he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity writing let not our peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords or our inability to draw them from their scabbards but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp furthermore in a formal lyceum debate in  he debated the subject is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance arguing the affirmative likewise his condemnation of the mexican–american war did not stem from pacifism but rather because he considered mexico unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army as a means to expand the slave territory thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism on one hand he regarded commerce as unexpectedly confident and serene adventurous and unwearied and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism writing i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer on the other hand he wrote disparagingly of the factory system i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched thoreau also favored bioregionalism the protection of animals and wild areas free trade and taxation for schools and highways he disapproved of the subjugation of native americans slavery technological utopianism consumerism philistinism mass entertainment and frivolous applications of technology intellectual interests influences and affinitiesedit indian sacred texts and philosophyedit krishna teaching arjuna from bhagavata gita a text thoreau read at walden pond thoreau was influenced by indian spiritual thought in walden there are many overt references to the sacred texts of india for example in the first chapter economy he writes how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east american philosophy an encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of god as separate from the world also a characteristic of hinduism furthermore in the pond in winter he equates walden pond with the sacred ganges river writing in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the brahmin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges thoreau was aware his ganges imagery could have been factual he wrote about ice harvesting at walden pond and he knew that new englands ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports including calcutta additionally thoreau followed various hindu customs including following a diet of rice it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india flute playing reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of krishna and yoga in an  letter to his friend hgo blake he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him free in this world as the birds in the air disengaged from every kind of chains those who practice yoga gather in brahma the certain fruits of their works depend upon it that rude and careless as i am i would fain practice the yoga faithfully the yogi absorbed in contemplation contributes in his degree to creation he breathes a divine perfume he hears wonderful things divine forms traverse him without tearing him and united to the nature which is proper to him he goes he acts as animating original matter to some extent and at rare intervals even i am a yogi biologyedit bird eggs found by thoreau and given to the boston society of natural history those in the nest are of yellow warbler the other two of redtailed hawk thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology including the works of alexander von humboldt charles darwin and asa gray charles darwins staunchest american ally thoreau was deeply influenced by humboldt especially his work kosmos in  thoreau purchased and read darwins on the origin of species unlike many natural historians at the time including louis agassiz who publicly opposed darwinism in favor of a static view of nature thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it stating the development theory implies a greater vital force in nature because it is more flexible and accommodating and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation a quote from on the origin of species follows this sentence influenceedit a bust of thoreau from the hall of fame for great americans at the bronx community college thoreaus careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time becoming stronger as the weaknesses thoreau noted have become more pronounced  events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at walden pond have been influenced by it including the national park system the british labor movement the creation of india the civil rights movement the hippie revolution the environmental movement and the wilderness movement today thoreaus words are quoted with feeling by liberals socialists anarchists libertarians and conservatives alike — ken kifer analysis and notes on walden henry thoreaus text with adjacent thoreauvian commentary thoreaus political writings had little impact during his lifetime as his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical viewing him instead as a naturalist they either dismissed or ignored his political essays including civil disobedience the only two complete books as opposed to essays published in his lifetime walden and a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  both dealt with nature in which he loved to wander his obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an  yearbook nevertheless thoreaus writings went on to influence many public figures political leaders and reformers like mohandas gandhi us president john f kennedy american civil rights activist martin luther king jr us supreme court justice william o douglas and russian author leo tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by thoreaus work particularly civil disobedience as did rightwing theorist frank chodorov who devoted an entire issue of his monthly analysis to an appreciation of thoreau thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including edward abbey willa cather marcel proust william butler yeats sinclair lewis ernest hemingway upton sinclair e b white lewis mumford frank lloyd wright alexander posey and gustav stickley thoreau also influenced naturalists like john burroughs john muir e o wilson edwin way teale joseph wood krutch b f skinner david brower and loren eiseley whom publishers weekly called the modern thoreau english writer henry stephens salt wrote a biography of thoreau in  which popularized thoreaus ideas in britain george bernard shaw edward carpenter and robert blatchford were among those who became thoreau enthusiasts as a result of salts advocacy mohandas gandhi first read walden in  while working as a civil rights activist in johannesburg south africa he first read civil disobedience while he sat in a south african prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the indian population in the transvaal the essay galvanized gandhi who wrote and published a synopsis of thoreaus argument calling its incisive logic  unanswerable and referring to thoreau as one of the greatest and most moral men america has produced he told american reporter webb miller thoreaus ideas influenced me greatly i adopted some of them and recommended the study of thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of indian independence why i actually took the name of my movement from thoreaus essay on the duty of civil disobedience written about  years ago martin luther king jr noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading on civil disobedience in  while attending morehouse college he wrote in his autobiography that it was here in this courageous new englanders refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slaverys territory into mexico i made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system i was so deeply moved that i reread the work several times i became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good no other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than henry david thoreau as a result of his writings and personal witness we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest the teachings of thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement indeed they are more alive than ever before whether expressed in a sitin at lunch counters a freedom ride into mississippi a peaceful protest in albany georgia a bus boycott in montgomery alabama these are outgrowths of thoreaus insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice american psychologist b f skinner wrote that he carried a copy of thoreaus walden with him in his youth and in  wrote walden two a fictional utopia about  members of a community living together inspired by the life of thoreau thoreau and his fellow transcendentalists from concord were a major inspiration of the composer charles ives the th movement of the concord sonata for piano with a part for flute thoreaus instrument is a character picture and he also set thoreaus words actor ron thompson did a dramatic portrayal of henry david thoreau on the  nbc television series the rebels thoreaus ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement with emma goldman referring to him as the greatest american anarchist green anarchism and anarchoprimitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological pointsofview from the writings of thoreau john zerzan included thoreaus text excursions  in his edited compilation of works in the anarchoprimitivist tradition titled against civilization readings and reflections additionally murray rothbard the founder of anarchocapitalism has opined that thoreau was one of the great intellectual heroes of his movement thoreau was also an important influence on latethcentury anarchist naturism globally thoreaus concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france and portugal criticismedit although his writings would receive widespread acclaim thoreaus ideas were not universally applauded scottish author robert louis stevenson judged thoreaus endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of unmanly effeminacy and womanish solitude while deeming him a selfindulgent skulker nathaniel hawthorne had mixed feelings about thoreau he noted that he is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  on the other hand he also wrote that thoreau repudiated all regular modes of getting a living and seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilized men in a similar vein poet john greenleaf whittier detested what he deemed to be the wicked and heathenish message of walden claiming that thoreau wanted man to lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs in response to such criticisms english novelist george eliot writing for the westminster review characterized such critics as uninspired and narrowminded people—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every mans life ordered according to a particular pattern and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them may poohpooh mr thoreau and this episode in his history as unpractical and dreamy thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained  unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives  i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits recent criticism has accused thoreau of hypocrisy misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in walden although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective worksedit this list is incomplete you can help by expanding it henry david thoreau core works and topics civil disobedience herald of freedom the

development critic surveyor and historian a leading transcendentalist thoreau is best known for his book walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience originally published as resistance to civil government an argument for disobedience to an unjust state thoreaus books articles essays journals and poetry amount to more than  volumes among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history two sources of modernday environmentalism his literary style interweaves close observation of nature personal experience pointed rhetoric symbolic meanings and historical lore while displaying a poetic sensibility philosophical austerity and yankee attention to practical detail he was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements historical change and natural decay at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover lifes true essential needs he was a lifelong abolitionist delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of wendell phillips and defending the abolitionist john brown thoreaus philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jrcitation needed thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist though civil disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism that government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have contents  pronunciation of his name  physical appearance  life  early life and education –  return to concord –  civil disobedience and the walden years –

thuroh—ˈθʌroʊ—in general american but more precisely thoroh—ˈθɔːroʊ—in thcentury new england edward waldo emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced thórow with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable among modernday american speakers it is perhaps more commonly pronounced thəroh—θəˈroʊ—with stress on the second syllable physical appearanceedit thoreau was a homely man with a nose that he called my most prominent feature of his appearance and disposition ellery channing wrote his face once seen could not be forgotten the features were quite marked the nose aquiline or very roman like one of the portraits of caesar more like a beak as was said large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen in certain lights and in others gray—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling but never weak or nearsighted the forehead not unusually broad or high full of concentrated energy and purpose the mouth with prominent lips pursed up with meaning and thought when silent and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings lifeedit early life and education –edit thoreaus birthplace the wheelerminot farmhouse in concord henry david thoreau was born david henry thoreau in concord massachusetts into the modest new england family of john thoreau a pencil maker and cynthia dunbar his paternal grandfather was born in jersey his maternal grandfather asa dunbar led harvards  student butter rebellion the first recorded student protest in the american colonies david henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle david thoreau he began to call himself henry david after he finished college he never petitioned to make a legal name change he had two older siblings helen and john jr and a younger sister sophia thoreaus birthplace still exists on virginia road in concord the house has been restored by the thoreau farm trust a nonprofit organization and is now open to the public he studied at harvard college between  and  he lived in hollis hall and took courses in rhetoric classics philosophy mathematics and sciencecitation needed he was a member of the institute of  now the hasty pudding club according to legend thoreau refused to pay the fivedollar fee for a harvard diploma in fact the masters degree he declined to purchase had no academic merit harvard college offered it to graduates who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating and their saving earning or inheriting quality or condition by having five dollars to give the college he commented let every sheep keep its own skin a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas return to concord –edit the traditional professions open to college graduates—law the church business medicine—did not interest thoreau so in  he took a leave of absence from harvard during which he taught school in canton massachusetts after he graduated in  he joined the faculty of the concord public school but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment he and his brother john then opened the concord academy a grammar school in concord in  they introduced several progressive concepts including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses the school closed when john became fatally ill from tetanus in  after cutting himself while shaving he died in henrys arms upon graduation thoreau returned home to concord where he met ralph waldo emerson through a mutual friend emerson took a paternal and at times patronizing interest in thoreau advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers including ellery channing margaret fuller bronson alcott and nathaniel hawthorne and his son julian hawthorne who was a boy at the time emerson urged thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical the dial and lobbied the editor margaret fuller to publish those writings thoreaus first essay published in the dial was aulus persius flaccus an essay on the roman playwright in july  it consisted of revised passages from his journal which he had begun keeping at emersons suggestion the first journal entry on october   reads what are you doing now he asked do you keep a journal so i make my first entry today thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition in his early years he followed transcendentalism a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by emerson fuller and alcott they held that an ideal spiritual state transcends or goes beyond the physical and empirical and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine in their view nature is the outward sign of inward spirit expressing the radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts as emerson wrote in nature   us postage stamp honoring thoreau designed by leonard baskin on april   thoreau moved into the emerson house there from  to  he served as the childrens tutor he was also an editorial assistant repairman and gardener for a few months in  he moved to the home of william emerson on staten island and tutored the familys sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings including his future literary representative horace greeley thoreau returned to concord and worked in his familys pencil factory which he continued to do for most of his adult life he rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder this invention improved upon graphite found in new hampshire and bought in  by a relative charles dunbar the process of mixing graphite and clay known as the conté process was patented by nicolasjacques conté in  his other source had been tantiusques a mine operated by native americans in sturbridge massachusetts later thoreau converted the factory to produce plumbago graphite which was used in the electrotyping process once back in concord thoreau went through a restless period in april  he and his friend edward hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed  acres  km of walden woods civil disobedience and the walden years –edit thoreau sites at walden pond i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion — henry david thoreau where i lived and what i lived for in walden thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing in march  ellery channing told thoreau go out upon that build yourself a hut  there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive i see no other alternative no other hope for you two months later thoreau embarked on a twoyear experiment in simple living on july   when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by emerson in a secondgrowth forest around the shores of walden pond the house was in a pretty pasture and woodlot of  acres  m that emerson had bought  miles  km from his family home original title page of walden with an illustration from a drawing by thoreaus sister sophia on july  or july   thoreau ran into the local tax collector sam staples who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes thoreau refused because of his opposition to the mexican–american war and slavery and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal the next day thoreau was freed when someone likely to have been his aunt paid the tax against his wishes the experience had a strong impact on thoreau in january and february  he delivered lectures on the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government explaining his tax resistance at the concord lyceum bronson alcott attended the lecture writing in his journal on january  heard thoreaus lecture before the lyceum on the relation of the individual to the state—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to selfgovernment and an attentive audience his allusions to the mexican war to mr hoars expulsion from carolina his own imprisonment in concord jail for refusal to pay his tax mr hoars payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal were all pertinent well considered and reasoned i took great pleasure in this deed of thoreaus — bronson alcott  journals thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled resistance to civil government also known as civil disobedience it was published by elizabeth peabody in the aesthetic papers in may  thoreau had taken up a version of percy shelleys principle in the political poem the mask of anarchy  which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action at walden pond thoreau completed a first draft of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers an elegy to his brother john describing their trip to the white mountains in  thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed  copies at his own expense fewer than  were sold he selfpublished the book on the advice of emerson using emersons publisher munroe who did little to publicize the book reconstruction of the interior of thoreaus cabin replica of thoreaus cabin and a statue of him near walden pond in august  thoreau briefly left walden to make a trip to mount katahdin in maine a journey later recorded in ktaadn the first part of the maine woods thoreau left walden pond on september   at emersons request he immediately moved back to the emerson house to help emersons wife lidian manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to europe over several years as he worked to pay off his debts he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as walden or life in the woods in  recounting the two years two months and two days he had spent at walden pond the book compresses that time into a single calendar year using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development part memoir and part spiritual quest walden at first won few admirers but later critics have regarded it as a classic american work that explores natural simplicity harmony and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions the american poet robert frost wrote of thoreau in one book  he surpasses everything we have had in america the american author john updike said of the book a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible thoreau moved out of emersons house in july  and stayed at a house on nearby belknap street in  he and his family moved into a house at  main street where he lived until his death later years –edit thoreau in  in  thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition he read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal he admired william bartram and charles darwins voyage of the beagle he kept detailed observations on concords nature lore recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of walden pond and the days certain birds migrated the point of this task was to anticipate the seasons of nature in his word he became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town covering an area of  square miles  km in his journal a twomillionword document he kept for  years he also kept a series of notebooks and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history such as autumnal tints the succession of trees and wild apples an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species until the s literary criticswho dismissed thoreaus late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy with the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines several new readings of thoreau began to emerge showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots for instance his late essay the succession of forest trees shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals walden pond he traveled to quebec once cape cod four times and maine three times these landscapes inspired his excursion books a yankee in canada cape cod and the maine woods in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography history and philosophy other travels took him southwest to philadelphia and new york city in  and west across the great lakes region in  when he visited niagara falls detroit chicago milwaukee st paul and mackinac island he was provincial in his own travels but he read widely about travel in other lands he devoured all the firsthand travel accounts available in his day at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored he read magellan and james cook the arctic explorers john franklin alexander mackenzie and william parry david livingstone and richard francis burton on africa lewis and clark and hundreds of lesserknown works by explorers and literate travelers astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples cultures religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals he processed everything he read in the local laboratory of his concord experience among his famous aphorisms is his advice to live at home like a traveler after john browns raid on harpers ferry many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from brown or damned him with faint praise thoreau was disgusted by this and he composed a key speech a plea for captain john brown which was uncompromising in its defense of brown and his actions thoreaus speech proved persuasive the abolitionist movement began to accept brown as a martyr and by the time of the american civil war entire armies of the north were literally singing browns praises as a biographer of brown put it if as alfred kazin suggests without john brown there would have been no civil war we would add that without the concord transcendentalists john brown would have had little cultural impact thoreau in his second and final photographic sitting august  deathedit thoreau contracted tuberculosis in  and suffered from it sporadically afterwards in  following a latenight excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm he became ill with bronchitis his health declined with brief periods of remission and he eventually became bedridden recognizing the terminal nature of his disease thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works particularly the maine woods and excursions and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of a week and walden he wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue his friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death when his aunt louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with god thoreau responded i did not know we had ever quarreled grave of thoreau at sleepy hollow cemetery in concord aware he was dying thoreaus last words were now comes good sailing followed by two lone words moose and indian he died on may   at age  bronson alcott planned the service and read selections from thoreaus works and channing presented a hymn emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral thoreau was buried in the dunbar family plot his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to sleepy hollow cemetery °′″n °′″w﻿  ﻿°n °w﻿    in concord massachusetts thoreaus friend ellery channing published his first biography thoreau the poetnaturalist in  channing and another friend harrison blake edited some poems essays and journal entries for posthumous publication in the s thoreaus journals which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death were first published in  and helped to build his modern reputation a new expanded edition of the journals is under way published by princeton university press today thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost american writers both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics his memory is honored by the international thoreau society and his by the thoreau institute at walden woods established in  in lincoln massachusetts nature and human existenceedit most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind — thoreau thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing of conserving natural resources on private land and of preserving wilderness as public land he was himself a highly skilled canoeist nathaniel hawthorne after a ride with him noted that mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he was not a strict vegetarian though he said he preferred that diet and advocated it as a means of selfimprovement he wrote in walden the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth thoreaus famous quotation near his cabin site at walden pond thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness instead he sought a middle ground the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture his philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in north america he decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them the wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest and he preferred partially cultivated country his idea of being far in the recesses of the wilderness of maine was to travel the loggers path and the indian trail but he also hiked on pristine land in the essay henry david thoreau philosopher roderick nash wrote thoreau left concord in  for the first of three trips to northern maine his expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine primeval america but contact with real wilderness in maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in concord instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance of alcohol thoreau wrote i would fain keep sober always i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes sexualityedit thoreau never married and was childless he strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan however his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation including by his contemporaries critics have called him heterosexual homosexual or asexual there is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone man or woman some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual the elegy sympathy was inspired by the elevenyearold edmund sewell with whom he hiked for five days in  one scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to edmunds sister and another that thoreaus emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns but other scholars dismiss this it has been argued that the long paean in walden to the frenchcanadian woodchopper alek therien which includes allusions to achilles and patroclus is an expression of conflicted desire in some of thoreaus writing there is the sense of a secret self in  he writes in his journal my friend is the apology for my life in him are the spaces which my orbit traverses thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire politicsedit part of the politics series on green anarchism schools of thought anarchonaturism social ecology

thoreau was fervently against slavery and actively supported the abolitionist movement he participated in the underground railroad delivered lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law and in opposition with the popular opinion of the time supported radical abolitionist militia leader john brown and his party two weeks after the illfated raid on harpers ferry and in the weeks leading up to browns execution thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of concord massachusetts in which he compared the american government to pontius pilate and likened browns execution to the crucifixion of jesus christ some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light in the last days of john brown thoreau described the words and deeds of john brown as noble and an example of heroism in addition he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed brown and his scheme as crazy thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have through selfbetterment the kind of government which governs not at all he distanced himself from contemporary nogovernment men anarchists writing i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as a progress toward true respect for the individual and theorized about further improvements towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man echoing this belief he went on to write there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly although thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent exemplified in his support for john brown and nonviolent his own example of tax resistance displayed in resistance to civil government he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity writing let not our peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords or our inability to draw them from their scabbards but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp furthermore in a formal lyceum debate in  he debated the subject is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance arguing the affirmative likewise his condemnation of the mexican–american war did not stem from pacifism but rather because he considered mexico unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army as a means to expand the slave territory thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism on one hand he regarded commerce as unexpectedly confident and serene adventurous and unwearied and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism writing i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer on the other hand he wrote disparagingly of the factory system i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched thoreau also favored bioregionalism the protection of animals and wild areas free trade and taxation for schools and highways he disapproved of the subjugation of native americans slavery technological utopianism consumerism philistinism mass entertainment and frivolous applications of technology intellectual interests influences and affinitiesedit indian sacred texts and philosophyedit krishna teaching arjuna from bhagavata gita a text thoreau read at walden pond thoreau was influenced by indian spiritual thought in walden there are many overt references to the sacred texts of india for example in the first chapter economy he writes how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east american philosophy an encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of god as separate from the world also a characteristic of hinduism furthermore in the pond in winter he equates walden pond with the sacred ganges river writing in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the brahmin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges thoreau was aware his ganges imagery could have been factual he wrote about ice harvesting at walden pond and he knew that new englands ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports including calcutta additionally thoreau followed various hindu customs including following a diet of rice it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india flute playing reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of krishna and yoga in an  letter to his friend hgo blake he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him free in this world as the birds in the air disengaged from every kind of chains those who practice yoga gather in brahma the certain fruits of their works depend upon it that rude and careless as i am i would fain practice the yoga faithfully the yogi absorbed in contemplation contributes in his degree to creation he breathes a divine perfume he hears wonderful things divine forms traverse him without tearing him and united to the nature which is proper to him he goes he acts as animating original matter to some extent and at rare intervals even i am a yogi biologyedit bird eggs found by thoreau and given to the boston society of natural history those in the nest are of yellow warbler the other two of redtailed hawk thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology including the works of alexander von humboldt charles darwin and asa gray charles darwins staunchest american ally thoreau was deeply influenced by humboldt especially his work kosmos in  thoreau purchased and read darwins on the origin of species unlike many natural historians at the time including louis agassiz who publicly opposed darwinism in favor of a static view of nature thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it stating the development theory implies a greater vital force in nature because it is more flexible and accommodating and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation a quote from on the origin of species follows this sentence influenceedit a bust of thoreau from the hall of fame for great americans at the bronx community college thoreaus careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time becoming stronger as the weaknesses thoreau noted have become more pronounced  events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at walden pond have been influenced by it including the national park system the british labor movement the creation of india the civil rights movement the hippie revolution the environmental movement and the wilderness movement today thoreaus words are quoted with feeling by liberals socialists anarchists libertarians and conservatives alike — ken kifer analysis and notes on walden henry thoreaus text with adjacent thoreauvian commentary thoreaus political writings had little impact during his lifetime as his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical viewing him instead as a naturalist they either dismissed or ignored his political essays including civil disobedience the only two complete books as opposed to essays published in his lifetime walden and a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  both dealt with nature in which he loved to wander his obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an  yearbook nevertheless thoreaus writings went on to influence many public figures political leaders and reformers like mohandas gandhi us president john f kennedy american civil rights activist martin luther king jr us supreme court justice william o douglas and russian author leo tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by thoreaus work particularly civil disobedience as did rightwing theorist frank chodorov who devoted an entire issue of his monthly analysis to an appreciation of thoreau thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including edward abbey willa cather marcel proust william butler yeats sinclair lewis ernest hemingway upton sinclair e b white lewis mumford frank lloyd wright alexander posey and gustav stickley thoreau also influenced naturalists like john burroughs john muir e o wilson edwin way teale joseph wood krutch b f skinner david brower and loren eiseley whom publishers weekly called the modern thoreau english writer henry stephens salt wrote a biography of thoreau in  which popularized thoreaus ideas in britain george bernard shaw edward carpenter and robert blatchford were among those who became thoreau enthusiasts as a result of salts advocacy mohandas gandhi first read walden in  while working as a civil rights activist in johannesburg south africa he first read civil disobedience while he sat in a south african prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the indian population in the transvaal the essay galvanized gandhi who wrote and published a synopsis of thoreaus argument calling its incisive logic  unanswerable and referring to thoreau as one of the greatest and most moral men america has produced he told american reporter webb miller thoreaus ideas influenced me greatly i adopted some of them and recommended the study of thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of indian independence why i actually took the name of my movement from thoreaus essay on the duty of civil disobedience written about  years ago martin luther king jr noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading on civil disobedience in  while attending morehouse college he wrote in his autobiography that it was here in this courageous new englanders refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slaverys territory into mexico i made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system i was so deeply moved that i reread the work several times i became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good no other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than henry david thoreau as a result of his writings and personal witness we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest the teachings of thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement indeed they are more alive than ever before whether expressed in a sitin at lunch counters a freedom ride into mississippi a peaceful protest in albany georgia a bus boycott in montgomery alabama these are outgrowths of thoreaus insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice american psychologist b f skinner wrote that he carried a copy of thoreaus walden with him in his youth and in  wrote walden two a fictional utopia about  members of a community living together inspired by the life of thoreau thoreau and his fellow transcendentalists from concord were a major inspiration of the composer charles ives the th movement of the concord sonata for piano with a part for flute thoreaus instrument is a character picture and he also set thoreaus words actor ron thompson did a dramatic portrayal of henry david thoreau on the  nbc television series the rebels thoreaus ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement with emma goldman referring to him as the greatest american anarchist green anarchism and anarchoprimitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological pointsofview from the writings of thoreau john zerzan included thoreaus text excursions  in his edited compilation of works in the anarchoprimitivist tradition titled against civilization readings and reflections additionally murray rothbard the founder of anarchocapitalism has opined that thoreau was one of the great intellectual heroes of his movement thoreau was also an important influence on latethcentury anarchist naturism globally thoreaus concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france and portugal criticismedit although his writings would receive widespread acclaim thoreaus ideas were not universally applauded scottish author robert louis stevenson judged thoreaus endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of unmanly effeminacy and womanish solitude while deeming him a selfindulgent skulker nathaniel hawthorne had mixed feelings about thoreau he noted that he is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  on the other hand he also wrote that thoreau repudiated all regular modes of getting a living and seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilized men in a similar vein poet john greenleaf whittier detested what he deemed to be the wicked and heathenish message of walden claiming that thoreau wanted man to lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs in response to such criticisms english novelist george eliot writing for the westminster review characterized such critics as uninspired and narrowminded people—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every mans life ordered according to a particular pattern and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them may poohpooh mr thoreau and this episode in his history as unpractical and dreamy thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained  unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives  i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits recent criticism has accused thoreau of hypocrisy misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in walden although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective worksedit this list

natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience originally published as resistance to civil government an argument for disobedience to an unjust state thoreaus books articles essays journals and poetry amount to more than  volumes among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history two sources of modernday environmentalism his literary style interweaves close observation of nature personal experience pointed rhetoric symbolic meanings and historical lore while displaying a poetic sensibility philosophical austerity and yankee attention to practical detail he was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements historical change and natural decay at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover lifes true essential needs he was a lifelong abolitionist delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of wendell phillips and defending the abolitionist john brown thoreaus philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jrcitation needed thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist though civil disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism that government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have contents  pronunciation of his name  physical appearance  life  early life and education –  return

appearanceedit thoreau was a homely man with a nose that he called my most prominent feature of his appearance and disposition ellery channing wrote his face once seen could not be forgotten the features were quite marked the nose aquiline or very roman like one of the portraits of caesar more like a beak as was said large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen in certain lights and in others gray—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling but never weak or nearsighted the forehead not unusually broad or high full of concentrated energy and purpose the mouth

dollars to give the college he commented let every sheep keep its own skin a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas return to concord –edit the traditional professions open to college graduates—law the church business medicine—did not interest thoreau so in  he took a leave of absence from harvard during which he taught school in canton massachusetts after he graduated in  he joined the faculty of the concord public school but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment he and his brother john then opened the concord academy a grammar school in concord in  they introduced several progressive concepts including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses the school closed when john became fatally ill from tetanus in  after cutting himself while shaving he died in henrys arms upon graduation thoreau returned home to concord where he met ralph waldo emerson through a mutual friend emerson took a paternal and at times patronizing interest in thoreau advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers including ellery channing margaret fuller bronson alcott and nathaniel hawthorne and his son julian hawthorne who was a boy at the time emerson urged thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical the dial and lobbied the editor margaret fuller to publish those writings thoreaus first essay published in the dial was aulus persius flaccus an essay on the roman playwright in july  it consisted of revised passages from his journal which he had begun keeping at emersons suggestion the first journal entry on october   reads what are you doing now he asked do you keep a journal so i make my first entry today thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition in his early years he followed transcendentalism a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by emerson fuller and alcott they held that an ideal spiritual state transcends or goes beyond the physical and empirical and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine in their view nature is the outward sign of inward spirit expressing the radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts as emerson wrote in nature   us postage stamp honoring thoreau designed by leonard baskin on april   thoreau moved into the emerson house there from  to  he served as the childrens tutor he was also an editorial assistant repairman and gardener for a few months in  he moved to the home of william emerson on staten island and tutored the familys sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings including his future literary representative horace greeley thoreau returned to concord and worked in his familys pencil factory which he continued to do for most of his adult life he rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder this invention improved upon graphite found in new hampshire and bought in  by a relative charles dunbar the process of mixing graphite and clay known as the conté process was patented by nicolasjacques conté in  his other source had been tantiusques a mine operated by native americans in sturbridge massachusetts later thoreau converted the factory to produce plumbago graphite which was used in the electrotyping process once back in concord thoreau went through a restless period in april  he and his friend edward hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed  acres  km of walden woods civil disobedience and the walden years –edit thoreau sites at walden pond i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion — henry david thoreau where i lived and what i lived for in walden thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing in march  ellery channing told thoreau go out upon that build yourself a hut  there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive i see no other alternative no other hope for you two months later thoreau embarked on a twoyear experiment in simple living on july   when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by emerson in a secondgrowth forest around the shores of walden pond the house was in a pretty pasture and woodlot of  acres  m that emerson had bought  miles  km from his family home original title page of walden with an illustration from a drawing by thoreaus sister sophia on july  or july   thoreau ran into the local tax collector sam staples who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes thoreau refused because of his opposition to the mexican–american war and slavery and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal the next day thoreau was freed when someone likely to have been his aunt paid the tax against his wishes the experience had a strong impact on thoreau in january and february  he delivered lectures on the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government explaining his tax resistance at the concord lyceum bronson alcott attended the lecture writing in his journal on january  heard thoreaus lecture before the lyceum on the relation of the individual to the state—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to selfgovernment and an attentive audience his allusions to the mexican war to mr hoars expulsion from carolina his own imprisonment in concord jail for refusal to pay his tax mr hoars payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal were all pertinent well considered and reasoned i took great pleasure in this deed of thoreaus — bronson alcott  journals thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled resistance to civil government also known as civil disobedience it was published by elizabeth peabody in the aesthetic papers in may  thoreau had taken up a version of percy shelleys principle in the political poem the mask of anarchy  which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action at walden pond thoreau completed a first draft of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers an elegy to his brother john describing their trip to the white mountains in  thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed  copies at his own expense fewer than  were sold he selfpublished the book on the advice of emerson using emersons publisher munroe who did little to publicize the book reconstruction of the interior of thoreaus cabin replica of thoreaus cabin and a statue of him near walden pond in august  thoreau briefly left walden to make a trip to mount katahdin in maine a journey later recorded in ktaadn the first part of the maine woods thoreau left walden pond on september   at emersons request he immediately moved back to the emerson house to help emersons wife lidian manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to europe over several years as he worked to pay off his debts he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as walden or life in the woods in  recounting the two years two months and two days he had spent at walden pond the book compresses that time into a single calendar year using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development part memoir and part spiritual quest walden at first won few admirers but later critics have regarded it as a classic american work that explores natural simplicity harmony and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions the american poet robert frost wrote of thoreau in one book  he surpasses everything we have had in america the american author john updike said of the book a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible thoreau moved out of emersons house in july  and stayed at a house on nearby belknap street in  he and his family moved into a house at  main street where he lived until his death later years –edit thoreau in  in  thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition he read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal he admired william bartram and charles darwins voyage of the beagle he kept detailed observations on concords nature lore recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of walden pond and the days certain birds migrated the point of this task was to anticipate the seasons of nature in his word he became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town covering an area of  square miles  km in his journal a twomillionword document he kept for  years he also kept a series of notebooks and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history such as autumnal tints the succession of trees and wild apples an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species until the s literary criticswho dismissed thoreaus late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy with the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines several new readings of thoreau began to emerge showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots for instance his late essay the succession of forest trees shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals walden pond he traveled to quebec once cape cod four times and maine three times these landscapes inspired his excursion books a yankee in canada cape cod and the maine woods in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography history and philosophy other travels took him southwest to philadelphia and new york city in  and west across the great lakes region in  when he visited niagara falls detroit chicago milwaukee st paul and mackinac island he was provincial in his own travels but he read widely about travel in other lands he devoured all the firsthand travel accounts available in his day at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored he read magellan and james cook the arctic explorers john franklin alexander mackenzie and william parry david livingstone and richard francis burton on africa lewis and clark and hundreds of lesserknown works by explorers and literate travelers astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples cultures religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals he processed everything he read in the local laboratory of his concord experience among his famous aphorisms is his advice to live at home like a traveler after john browns raid on harpers ferry many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from brown or damned him with faint praise thoreau was disgusted by this and he composed a key speech a plea for captain john brown which was uncompromising in its defense of brown and his actions thoreaus speech proved persuasive the abolitionist movement began to accept brown as a martyr and by the time of the american civil war entire armies of the north were literally singing browns praises as a biographer of brown put it if as alfred kazin suggests without john brown there would have been no civil war we would add that without the concord transcendentalists john brown would have had little cultural impact thoreau in his second and final photographic sitting august  deathedit thoreau contracted tuberculosis in  and suffered from it sporadically afterwards in  following a latenight excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm he became ill with bronchitis his health declined with brief periods of remission and he eventually became bedridden recognizing the terminal nature of his disease thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works particularly the maine woods and excursions and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of a week and walden he wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue his friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death when his aunt

death were first published in  and helped to build his modern reputation a new expanded edition of the journals is under way published by princeton university press today thoreau is regarded as one of

by the thoreau institute at walden woods established in  in lincoln massachusetts nature and human existenceedit most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind — thoreau thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing of conserving natural resources on private land and of preserving wilderness as public land he was himself a highly skilled canoeist nathaniel hawthorne after a ride with him noted that mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he was not a strict vegetarian though he said he preferred that diet and advocated it as a means of selfimprovement he wrote in walden the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth thoreaus famous quotation near his cabin site at walden pond thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness instead he sought a middle ground the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture his philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in north america he decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them the wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest and he preferred partially cultivated country his idea of being far in the recesses of the wilderness of maine was to travel the loggers path and the indian trail but he also hiked on pristine land in the essay henry david thoreau philosopher roderick nash wrote thoreau left concord in  for the first of three trips to northern maine his expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine primeval america but contact with real wilderness in maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in concord instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance of alcohol thoreau wrote i would fain keep sober always i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes sexualityedit thoreau never married and was childless he strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan however his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation including by his contemporaries critics have called him heterosexual homosexual or asexual there is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone man or woman some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual the elegy sympathy was inspired by the elevenyearold edmund sewell with whom he hiked for five days in  one scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to edmunds sister and another that thoreaus emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns but other scholars dismiss this it has been argued that the long paean in walden to the frenchcanadian woodchopper alek therien which includes allusions to achilles and patroclus is an expression of conflicted desire in some of thoreaus writing there is the sense of a secret self in  he writes in his journal my friend is the apology for my life in him are the spaces which my orbit traverses thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time and this may have instilled anxiety and guilt over sexual desire politicsedit

in the underground railroad delivered lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law and in opposition with the popular opinion of the time supported radical abolitionist militia leader john brown and his party two weeks after the illfated raid on harpers ferry and in the weeks leading up to browns execution thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of concord massachusetts in which he compared the american government to pontius pilate and likened browns execution to the crucifixion of jesus christ some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light in the last days of john brown thoreau described the words and deeds of john brown as noble and an example of heroism in addition he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed brown and his scheme as crazy thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have through selfbetterment the kind of government which governs not at all he distanced himself from contemporary nogovernment men anarchists writing i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as a progress toward true respect for the individual and theorized about further improvements towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man echoing this belief he went on to write there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly although thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent exemplified in his support for john brown and nonviolent his own example of tax resistance displayed in resistance to civil government he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity writing let not our peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords or our inability to draw them from their scabbards but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp furthermore in a formal lyceum debate in  he debated the subject is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance arguing the affirmative likewise his condemnation of the mexican–american war did not stem from pacifism but rather because he considered mexico unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army as a means to expand the slave territory thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism on one hand he regarded commerce as unexpectedly confident and serene adventurous and unwearied and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism writing i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer on the other hand he wrote disparagingly of the factory system i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched thoreau also favored bioregionalism the protection of animals and wild areas free trade and taxation for schools and highways he disapproved of the subjugation of native americans slavery technological utopianism consumerism philistinism mass entertainment and frivolous applications of technology intellectual interests influences and affinitiesedit indian sacred texts and philosophyedit krishna teaching arjuna from bhagavata gita a text thoreau read at walden pond thoreau was influenced by indian spiritual thought in walden there are many overt references to the sacred texts of india for example in the first chapter economy he writes how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east american philosophy an encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of god as separate from the world also a characteristic of hinduism furthermore in the pond in winter he equates walden pond with the sacred ganges river writing in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the brahmin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges thoreau was aware his ganges imagery could have been factual he wrote about ice harvesting at walden pond and he knew that new englands ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports including calcutta additionally thoreau followed various hindu customs including following a diet of rice it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india flute playing reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of krishna and yoga in an  letter to his friend hgo blake he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him free in this world as the birds in the air disengaged from every kind of chains those who practice yoga gather in brahma the certain fruits of their works depend upon it that rude and careless as i am i would fain practice the yoga faithfully the yogi absorbed in contemplation contributes in his degree to creation he breathes a divine perfume he hears wonderful things divine forms traverse him without tearing him and united to the nature which is proper to him he goes he acts as animating original matter to some extent and at rare intervals even i am a yogi biologyedit bird eggs found by thoreau and given to the boston society of natural history those in the nest are of yellow warbler the other two of redtailed hawk thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology including the works of alexander von humboldt charles darwin and asa gray charles darwins staunchest american ally thoreau was deeply influenced by humboldt especially his work kosmos in  thoreau purchased and read darwins on the origin of species unlike many natural historians at the time including louis agassiz who publicly opposed darwinism in favor of a static view of nature thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it stating the development theory implies a greater vital force in nature because it is more flexible and accommodating and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation a quote from on the origin of species follows this sentence influenceedit a bust of thoreau from the hall of fame for great americans at the bronx community college thoreaus careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time becoming stronger as the weaknesses thoreau noted have become more pronounced  events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at walden pond have been influenced by it including the national park system the british labor movement the creation of india the civil rights movement the hippie revolution the environmental movement and the wilderness movement today thoreaus words are quoted with feeling by liberals socialists anarchists libertarians and conservatives alike — ken kifer analysis and notes on walden henry thoreaus text with adjacent thoreauvian commentary thoreaus political writings had little impact during his lifetime as his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical viewing him instead as a naturalist they either dismissed or ignored his political essays including civil disobedience the only two complete books as opposed to essays published in his lifetime walden and a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  both dealt with nature in which he loved to wander his obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an  yearbook nevertheless thoreaus writings went on to influence many public figures political leaders and reformers like mohandas gandhi us president john f kennedy american civil rights activist martin luther king jr us supreme court justice william o douglas and russian author leo tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by thoreaus work particularly civil disobedience as did rightwing theorist frank chodorov who devoted an entire issue of his monthly analysis to an appreciation of thoreau thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including edward abbey willa cather marcel proust william butler yeats sinclair lewis ernest hemingway upton sinclair e b white lewis mumford frank lloyd wright alexander posey and gustav stickley thoreau also influenced naturalists like john burroughs john muir e o wilson edwin way teale joseph wood krutch b f skinner david brower and loren eiseley whom publishers weekly called the modern thoreau english writer henry stephens salt wrote a biography of thoreau in  which popularized thoreaus ideas in britain george bernard shaw edward carpenter and robert blatchford were among those who became thoreau enthusiasts as a result of salts advocacy mohandas gandhi first read walden in  while working as a civil rights activist in johannesburg south africa he first read civil disobedience while he sat in a south african prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the indian population in the transvaal the essay galvanized gandhi who wrote and published a synopsis of thoreaus argument calling its incisive logic  unanswerable and referring to thoreau as one of the greatest and most moral men america has produced he told american reporter webb miller thoreaus ideas influenced me greatly i adopted some of them and recommended the study of thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of indian independence why i actually took the name of my movement from thoreaus essay on the duty of civil disobedience written about  years ago martin luther king jr noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading on civil disobedience in  while attending morehouse college he wrote in his autobiography that it was here in this courageous new englanders refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slaverys territory into mexico i made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system i was so deeply moved that i reread the work several times i became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good no other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than henry david thoreau as a result of his writings and personal witness we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest the teachings of thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement indeed they are more alive than ever before whether expressed in a sitin at lunch counters a freedom ride into mississippi a peaceful protest in albany georgia a bus boycott in montgomery alabama these are outgrowths of thoreaus insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice american psychologist b f skinner wrote that he carried a copy of thoreaus walden with him in his youth and in  wrote walden two a fictional utopia about  members of a community living together inspired by the life of thoreau thoreau and his fellow transcendentalists from concord were a major inspiration of the composer charles ives the th movement of the concord sonata for piano with a part for flute thoreaus instrument is a character picture and he also set thoreaus words actor ron thompson did a dramatic portrayal of henry david thoreau on the  nbc television series the rebels thoreaus ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement with emma goldman referring to him as the greatest american anarchist green anarchism and anarchoprimitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological pointsofview from the writings of thoreau john zerzan included thoreaus text excursions  in his edited compilation of works in the anarchoprimitivist tradition titled against civilization readings and reflections additionally murray rothbard the founder of anarchocapitalism has opined that thoreau was one of the great intellectual heroes of his movement thoreau was also an important influence on latethcentury anarchist naturism globally thoreaus concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france and portugal criticismedit although his writings would receive widespread acclaim thoreaus ideas were not universally applauded scottish author robert louis stevenson judged thoreaus endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of unmanly effeminacy and womanish solitude while deeming him a selfindulgent skulker nathaniel hawthorne had mixed feelings about thoreau he noted that he is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  on the other hand he also wrote that thoreau repudiated all regular modes of getting a living and seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilized men in a similar vein poet john greenleaf whittier detested what he deemed to be the wicked and heathenish message of walden claiming that thoreau wanted man to lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs in response to such criticisms english novelist george eliot writing for the westminster review characterized such critics as uninspired and narrowminded people—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every mans life ordered according to a particular pattern and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them may poohpooh mr thoreau and this episode in his history as unpractical and dreamy thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained  unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives  i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits recent criticism has accused thoreau of hypocrisy misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in walden although

leading transcendentalist thoreau is best known for his book walden a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings and his essay civil disobedience originally published as resistance to civil government an argument for disobedience to an unjust state thoreaus books articles essays journals and poetry amount to more than  volumes among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history two sources of modernday environmentalism his literary style interweaves close observation of nature personal experience pointed rhetoric symbolic meanings and historical lore while displaying a poetic sensibility philosophical austerity and yankee attention to practical detail he was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements historical change and natural decay at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover lifes true essential needs he was a lifelong abolitionist delivering lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law while praising the writings of wendell phillips and defending the abolitionist john brown thoreaus philosophy of civil disobedience later influenced the political thoughts and actions of such notable figures as leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi and martin luther king jrcitation needed thoreau is sometimes referred to as an anarchist though civil disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government—i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government—the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism that government is best which governs not at all and when men are prepared for it that will be the kind of government which they will have

more precisely thoroh—ˈθɔːroʊ—in thcentury new england edward waldo emerson wrote that the name should be pronounced thórow with the h sounded and stress on the first syllable among modernday american speakers it is perhaps more commonly pronounced thəroh—θəˈroʊ—with stress on the second syllable physical appearanceedit thoreau was a homely man with a nose that he called my most prominent feature of his appearance and disposition ellery channing wrote his face once seen could not be forgotten the features were quite marked the nose aquiline or very roman like one of the portraits of caesar more like a beak as was said large overhanging brows above the deepest set blue eyes that could be seen in certain lights and in others gray—eyes expressive of all shades of feeling but never weak or nearsighted the forehead not unusually broad or high full of concentrated energy and purpose the mouth with prominent lips pursed up with meaning and thought when silent and giving out when open with the most varied and unusual instructive sayings lifeedit early life and education –edit thoreaus birthplace the wheelerminot farmhouse in concord henry david thoreau was born david henry thoreau in concord massachusetts into the modest new england family of john thoreau a pencil maker and cynthia dunbar his paternal grandfather was born in jersey his maternal grandfather asa dunbar led harvards  student butter rebellion the first recorded student protest in the american colonies david henry was named after his recently deceased paternal uncle david thoreau he began to call himself henry david after he finished college he never petitioned to make a legal name change he had two older siblings helen and john jr and a younger sister sophia thoreaus birthplace still exists on virginia road in concord the house has been restored by the thoreau farm trust a nonprofit organization and is now open to the public he studied at harvard college between  and  he lived in hollis hall and took courses in rhetoric classics philosophy mathematics and sciencecitation needed he was a member of the institute of  now the hasty pudding club according to legend thoreau refused to pay the fivedollar fee for a harvard diploma in fact the masters degree he declined to purchase had no academic merit harvard college offered it to graduates who proved their physical worth by being alive three years after graduating and their saving earning or inheriting quality or condition by having five dollars to give the college he commented let every sheep keep its own skin a reference to the tradition of using sheepskin vellum for diplomas return to concord –edit the traditional professions open to college graduates—law the church business medicine—did not interest thoreau so in  he took a leave of absence from harvard during which he taught school in canton massachusetts after he graduated in  he joined the faculty of the concord public school but he resigned after a few weeks rather than administer corporal punishment he and his brother john then opened the concord academy a grammar school in concord in  they introduced several progressive concepts including nature walks and visits to local shops and businesses the school closed when john became fatally ill from tetanus in  after cutting himself while shaving he died in henrys arms upon graduation thoreau returned home to concord where he met ralph waldo emerson through a mutual friend emerson took a paternal and at times patronizing interest in thoreau advising the young man and introducing him to a circle of local writers and thinkers including ellery channing margaret fuller bronson alcott and nathaniel hawthorne and his son julian hawthorne who was a boy at the time emerson urged thoreau to contribute essays and poems to a quarterly periodical the dial and lobbied the editor margaret fuller to publish those writings thoreaus first essay published in the dial was aulus persius flaccus an essay on the roman playwright in july  it consisted of revised passages from his journal which he had begun keeping at emersons suggestion the first journal entry on october   reads what are you doing now he asked do you keep a journal so i make my first entry today thoreau was a philosopher of nature and its relation to the human condition in his early years he followed transcendentalism a loose and eclectic idealist philosophy advocated by emerson fuller and alcott they held that an ideal spiritual state transcends or goes beyond the physical and empirical and that one achieves that insight via personal intuition rather than religious doctrine in their view nature is the outward sign of inward spirit expressing the radical correspondence of visible things and human thoughts as emerson wrote in nature   us postage stamp honoring thoreau designed by leonard baskin on april   thoreau moved into the emerson house there from  to  he served as the childrens tutor he was also an editorial assistant repairman and gardener for a few months in  he moved to the home of william emerson on staten island and tutored the familys sons while seeking contacts among literary men and journalists in the city who might help publish his writings including his future literary representative horace greeley thoreau returned to concord and worked in his familys pencil factory which he continued to do for most of his adult life he rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder this invention improved upon graphite found in new hampshire and bought in  by a relative charles dunbar the process of mixing graphite and clay known as the conté process was patented by nicolasjacques conté in  his other source had been tantiusques a mine operated by native americans in sturbridge massachusetts later thoreau converted the factory to produce plumbago graphite which was used in the electrotyping process once back in concord thoreau went through a restless period in april  he and his friend edward hoar accidentally set a fire that consumed  acres  km of walden woods civil disobedience and the walden years –edit thoreau sites at walden pond i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived i did not wish to live what was not life living is so dear nor did i wish to practise resignation unless it was quite necessary i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life to live so sturdily and spartanlike as to put to rout all that was not life to cut a broad swath and shave close to drive life into a corner and reduce it to its lowest terms and if it proved to be mean why then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience and be able to give a true account of it in my next excursion — henry david thoreau where i lived and what i lived for in walden thoreau felt a need to concentrate and work more on his writing in march  ellery channing told thoreau go out upon that build yourself a hut  there begin the grand process of devouring yourself alive i see no other alternative no other hope for you two months later thoreau embarked on a twoyear experiment in simple living on july   when he moved to a small house he had built on land owned by emerson in a secondgrowth forest around the shores of walden pond the house was in a pretty pasture and woodlot of  acres  m that emerson had bought  miles  km from his family home original title page of walden with an illustration from a drawing by thoreaus sister sophia on july  or july   thoreau ran into the local tax collector sam staples who asked him to pay six years of delinquent poll taxes thoreau refused because of his opposition to the mexican–american war and slavery and he spent a night in jail because of this refusal the next day thoreau was freed when someone likely to have been his aunt paid the tax against his wishes the experience had a strong impact on thoreau in january and february  he delivered lectures on the rights and duties of the individual in relation to government explaining his tax resistance at the concord lyceum bronson alcott attended the lecture writing in his journal on january  heard thoreaus lecture before the lyceum on the relation of the individual to the state—an admirable statement of the rights of the individual to selfgovernment and an attentive audience his allusions to the mexican war to mr hoars expulsion from carolina his own imprisonment in concord jail for refusal to pay his tax mr hoars payment of mine when taken to prison for a similar refusal were all pertinent well considered and reasoned i took great pleasure in this deed of thoreaus — bronson alcott  journals thoreau revised the lecture into an essay titled resistance to civil government also known as civil disobedience it was published by elizabeth peabody in the aesthetic papers in may  thoreau had taken up a version of percy shelleys principle in the political poem the mask of anarchy  which begins with the powerful images of the unjust forms of authority of his time and then imagines the stirrings of a radically new form of social action at walden pond thoreau completed a first draft of a week on the concord and merrimack rivers an elegy to his brother john describing their trip to the white mountains in  thoreau did not find a publisher for the book and instead printed  copies at his own expense fewer than  were sold he selfpublished the book on the advice of emerson using emersons publisher munroe who did little to publicize the book reconstruction of the interior of thoreaus cabin replica of thoreaus cabin and a statue of him near walden pond in august  thoreau briefly left walden to make a trip to mount katahdin in maine a journey later recorded in ktaadn the first part of the maine woods thoreau left walden pond on september   at emersons request he immediately moved back to the emerson house to help emersons wife lidian manage the household while her husband was on an extended trip to europe over several years as he worked to pay off his debts he continuously revised the manuscript of what he eventually published as walden or life in the woods in  recounting the two years two months and two days he had spent at walden pond the book compresses that time into a single calendar year using the passage of the four seasons to symbolize human development part memoir and part spiritual quest walden at first won few admirers but later critics have regarded it as a classic american work that explores natural simplicity harmony and beauty as models for just social and cultural conditions the american poet robert frost wrote of thoreau in one book  he surpasses everything we have had in america the american author john updike said of the book a century and a half after its publication walden has become such a totem of the backtonature preservationist antibusiness civildisobedience mindset and thoreau so vivid a protester so perfect a crank and hermit saint that the book risks being as revered and unread as the bible thoreau moved out of emersons house in july  and stayed at a house on nearby belknap street in  he and his family moved into a house at  main street where he lived until his death later years –edit thoreau in  in  thoreau became increasingly fascinated with natural history and narratives of travel and expedition he read avidly on botany and often wrote observations on this topic into his journal he admired william bartram and charles darwins voyage of the beagle he kept detailed observations on concords nature lore recording everything from how the fruit ripened over time to the fluctuating depths of walden pond and the days certain birds migrated the point of this task was to anticipate the seasons of nature in his word he became a land surveyor and continued to write increasingly detailed observations on the natural history of the town covering an area of  square miles  km in his journal a twomillionword document he kept for  years he also kept a series of notebooks and these observations became the source of his late writings on natural history such as autumnal tints the succession of trees and wild apples an essay lamenting the destruction of indigenous wild apple species until the s literary criticswho dismissed thoreaus late pursuits as amateur science and philosophy with the rise of environmental history and ecocriticism as academic disciplines several new readings of thoreau began to emerge showing him to have been both a philosopher and an analyst of ecological patterns in fields and woodlots for instance his late essay the succession of forest trees shows that he used experimentation and analysis to explain how forests regenerate after fire or human destruction through the dispersal of seeds by winds or animals walden pond he traveled to quebec once cape cod four times and maine three times these landscapes inspired his excursion books a yankee in canada cape cod and the maine woods in which travel itineraries frame his thoughts about geography history and philosophy other travels took him southwest to philadelphia and new york city in  and west across the great lakes region in  when he visited niagara falls detroit chicago milwaukee st paul and mackinac island he was provincial in his own travels but he read widely about travel in other lands he devoured all the firsthand travel accounts available in his day at a time when the last unmapped regions of the earth were being explored he read magellan and james cook the arctic explorers john franklin alexander mackenzie and william parry david livingstone and richard francis burton on africa lewis and clark and hundreds of lesserknown works by explorers and literate travelers astonishing amounts of reading fed his endless curiosity about the peoples cultures religions and natural history of the world and left its traces as commentaries in his voluminous journals he processed everything he read in the local laboratory of his concord experience among his famous aphorisms is his advice to live at home like a traveler after john browns raid on harpers ferry many prominent voices in the abolitionist movement distanced themselves from brown or damned him with faint praise thoreau was disgusted by this and he composed a key speech a plea for captain john brown which was uncompromising in its defense of brown and his actions thoreaus speech proved persuasive the abolitionist movement began to accept brown as a martyr and by the time of the american civil war entire armies of the north were literally singing browns praises as a biographer of brown put it if as alfred kazin suggests without john brown there would have been no civil war we would add that without the concord transcendentalists john brown would have had little cultural impact thoreau in his second and final photographic sitting august  deathedit thoreau contracted tuberculosis in  and suffered from it sporadically afterwards in  following a latenight excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm he became ill with bronchitis his health declined with brief periods of remission and he eventually became bedridden recognizing the terminal nature of his disease thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works particularly the maine woods and excursions and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of a week and walden he wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue his friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death when his aunt louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with god thoreau responded i did not know we had ever quarreled grave of thoreau at sleepy hollow cemetery in concord aware he was dying thoreaus last words were now comes good sailing followed by two lone words moose and indian he died on may   at age  bronson alcott

thoreau the poetnaturalist in  channing and another friend harrison blake edited some poems essays and journal entries for posthumous publication in the s thoreaus journals which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death were first published in  and helped to build his modern reputation a new expanded edition of the journals is under way published by princeton university press today thoreau is regarded as one of the foremost american writers both for the modern clarity of his prose style and the prescience of his views on nature and politics his memory is honored by the international thoreau society and his by the thoreau institute at walden woods established in  in lincoln massachusetts nature and human existenceedit most of the luxuries and many of the socalled comforts of life are not only not indispensable but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind — thoreau thoreau was an early advocate of recreational hiking and canoeing of conserving natural resources on private land and of preserving wilderness as public land he was himself a highly skilled canoeist nathaniel hawthorne after a ride with him noted that mr thoreau managed the boat so perfectly either with two paddles or with one that it seemed instinct with his own will and to require no physical effort to guide it  he was not a strict vegetarian though he said he preferred that diet and advocated it as a means of selfimprovement he wrote in walden the practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness and besides when i had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish they seemed not to have fed me essentially it was insignificant and unnecessary and cost more than it came to a little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well with less trouble and filth thoreaus famous quotation near his cabin site at walden pond thoreau neither rejected civilization nor fully embraced wilderness instead he sought a middle ground the pastoral realm that integrates nature and culture his philosophy required that he be a didactic arbitrator between the wilderness he based so much on and the spreading mass of humanity in north america he decried the latter endlessly but felt that a teacher needs to be close to those who needed to hear what he wanted to tell them the wildness he enjoyed was the nearby swamp or forest and he preferred partially cultivated country his idea of being far in the recesses of the wilderness of maine was to travel the loggers path and the indian trail but he also hiked on pristine land in the essay henry david thoreau philosopher roderick nash wrote thoreau left concord in  for the first of three trips to northern maine his expectations were high because he hoped to find genuine primeval america but contact with real wilderness in maine affected him far differently than had the idea of wilderness in concord instead of coming out of the woods with a deepened appreciation of the wilds thoreau felt a greater respect for civilization and realized the necessity of balance of alcohol thoreau wrote i would fain keep sober always i believe that water is the only drink for a wise man wine is not so noble a liquor of all ebriosity who does not prefer to be intoxicated by the air he breathes sexualityedit thoreau never married and was childless he strove to portray himself as an ascetic puritan however his sexuality has long been the subject of speculation including by his contemporaries critics have called him heterosexual homosexual or asexual there is no evidence to suggest he had physical relations with anyone man or woman some scholars have suggested that homoerotic sentiments run through his writings and concluded that he was homosexual the elegy sympathy was inspired by the elevenyearold edmund sewell with whom he hiked for five days in  one scholar has suggested that he wrote the poem to edmund because he could not bring himself to write it to edmunds sister and another that thoreaus emotional experiences with women are memorialized under a camouflage of masculine pronouns but other scholars dismiss this it has been argued that the long paean in walden to the frenchcanadian woodchopper alek therien which includes allusions to achilles and patroclus is an expression of conflicted desire in some of thoreaus writing there is the sense of a secret self in  he writes in his journal my friend is the apology for my life in him are the spaces which my orbit traverses thoreau was strongly influenced by the moral reformers of his time and this may have instilled

supported the abolitionist movement he participated in the underground railroad delivered lectures that attacked the fugitive slave law and in opposition with the popular opinion of the time supported radical abolitionist militia leader john brown and his party two weeks after the illfated raid on harpers ferry and in the weeks leading up to browns execution thoreau regularly delivered a speech to the citizens of concord massachusetts in which he compared the american government to pontius pilate and likened browns execution to the crucifixion of jesus christ some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light in the last days of john brown thoreau described the words and deeds of john brown as noble and an example of heroism in addition he lamented the newspaper editors who dismissed brown and his scheme as crazy thoreau was a proponent of limited government and individualism although he was hopeful that mankind could potentially have through selfbetterment the kind of government which governs not at all he distanced himself from contemporary nogovernment men anarchists writing i ask for not at once no government but at once a better government thoreau deemed the evolution from absolute monarchy to limited monarchy to democracy as a progress toward true respect for the individual and theorized about further improvements towards recognizing and organizing the rights of man echoing this belief he went on to write there will never be a really free and enlightened state until the state comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power from which all its power and authority are derived and treats him accordingly although thoreau believed resistance to unjustly exercised authority could be both violent exemplified in his support for john brown and nonviolent his own example of tax resistance displayed in resistance to civil government he regarded pacifist nonresistance as temptation to passivity writing let not our peace be proclaimed by the rust on our swords or our inability to draw them from their scabbards but let her at least have so much work on her hands as to keep those swords bright and sharp furthermore in a formal lyceum debate in  he debated the subject is it ever proper to offer forcible resistance arguing the affirmative likewise his condemnation of the mexican–american war did not stem from pacifism but rather because he considered mexico unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army as a means to expand the slave territory thoreau was ambivalent towards industrialization and capitalism on one hand he regarded commerce as unexpectedly confident and serene adventurous and unwearied and expressed admiration for its associated cosmopolitanism writing i am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me and i smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from long wharf to lake champlain reminding me of foreign parts of coral reefs and indian oceans and tropical climes and the extent of the globe i feel more like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palmleaf which will cover so many flaxen new england heads the next summer on the other hand he wrote disparagingly of the factory system i cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get clothing the condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that of the english and it cannot be wondered at since as far as i have heard or observed the principal object is not that mankind may be well and honestly clad but unquestionably that corporations may be enriched thoreau also favored bioregionalism the protection of animals and wild areas free trade and taxation for schools and highways he disapproved of the subjugation of native americans slavery technological utopianism consumerism philistinism mass entertainment and frivolous applications of technology intellectual interests influences and affinitiesedit indian sacred texts and philosophyedit krishna teaching arjuna from bhagavata gita a text thoreau read at walden pond thoreau was influenced by indian spiritual thought in walden there are many overt references to the sacred texts of india for example in the first chapter economy he writes how much more admirable the bhagvatgeeta than all the ruins of the east american philosophy an encyclopedia classes him as one of several figures who took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of god as separate from the world also a characteristic of hinduism furthermore in the pond in winter he equates walden pond with the sacred ganges river writing in the morning i bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the bhagvat geeta since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed and in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial and i doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions i lay down the book and go to my well for water and lo there i meet the servant of the brahmin priest of brahma and vishnu and indra who still sits in his temple on the ganges reading the vedas or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug i meet his servant come to draw water for his master and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well the pure walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the ganges thoreau was aware his ganges imagery could have been factual he wrote about ice harvesting at walden pond and he knew that new englands ice merchants were shipping ice to foreign ports including calcutta additionally thoreau followed various hindu customs including following a diet of rice it was fit that i should live on rice mainly who loved so well the philosophy of india flute playing reminiscent of the favorite musical pastime of krishna and yoga in an  letter to his friend hgo blake he wrote about yoga and its meaning to him free in this world as the birds in the air disengaged from every kind of chains those who practice yoga gather in brahma the certain fruits of their works depend upon it that rude and careless as i am i would fain practice the yoga faithfully the yogi absorbed in contemplation contributes in his degree to creation he breathes a divine perfume he hears wonderful things divine forms traverse him without tearing him and united to the nature which is proper to him he goes he acts as animating original matter to some extent and at rare intervals even i am a yogi biologyedit bird eggs found by thoreau and given to the boston society of natural history those in the nest are of yellow warbler the other two of redtailed hawk thoreau read contemporary works in the new science of biology including the works of alexander von humboldt charles darwin and asa gray charles darwins staunchest american ally thoreau was deeply influenced by humboldt especially his work kosmos in  thoreau purchased and read darwins on the origin of species unlike many natural historians at the time including louis agassiz who publicly opposed darwinism in favor of a static view of nature thoreau was immediately enthusiastic about the theory of evolution by natural selection and endorsed it stating the development theory implies a greater vital force in nature because it is more flexible and accommodating and equivalent to a sort of constant new creation a quote from on the origin of species follows this sentence influenceedit a bust of thoreau from the hall of fame for great americans at the bronx community college thoreaus careful observations and devastating conclusions have rippled into time becoming stronger as the weaknesses thoreau noted have become more pronounced  events that seem to be completely unrelated to his stay at walden pond have been influenced by it including the national park system the british labor movement the creation of india the civil rights movement the hippie revolution the environmental movement and the wilderness movement today thoreaus words are quoted with feeling by liberals socialists anarchists libertarians and conservatives alike — ken kifer analysis and notes on walden henry thoreaus text with adjacent thoreauvian commentary thoreaus political writings had little impact during his lifetime as his contemporaries did not see him as a theorist or as a radical viewing him instead as a naturalist they either dismissed or ignored his political essays including civil disobedience the only two complete books as opposed to essays published in his lifetime walden and a week on the concord and merrimack rivers  both dealt with nature in which he loved to wander his obituary was lumped in with others rather than as a separate article in an  yearbook nevertheless thoreaus writings went on to influence many public figures political leaders and reformers like mohandas gandhi us president john f kennedy american civil rights activist martin luther king jr us supreme court justice william o douglas and russian author leo tolstoy all spoke of being strongly affected by thoreaus work particularly civil disobedience as did rightwing theorist frank chodorov who devoted an entire issue of his monthly analysis to an appreciation of thoreau thoreau also influenced many artists and authors including edward abbey willa cather marcel proust william butler yeats sinclair lewis ernest hemingway upton sinclair e b white lewis mumford frank lloyd wright alexander posey and gustav stickley thoreau also influenced naturalists like john burroughs john muir e o wilson edwin way teale joseph wood krutch b f skinner david brower and loren eiseley whom publishers weekly called the modern thoreau english writer henry stephens salt wrote a biography of thoreau in  which popularized thoreaus ideas in britain george bernard shaw edward carpenter and robert blatchford were among those who became thoreau enthusiasts as a result of salts advocacy mohandas gandhi first read walden in  while working as a civil rights activist in johannesburg south africa he first read civil disobedience while he sat in a south african prison for the crime of nonviolently protesting discrimination against the indian population in the transvaal the essay galvanized gandhi who wrote and published a synopsis of thoreaus argument calling its incisive logic  unanswerable and referring to thoreau as one of the greatest and most moral men america has produced he told american reporter webb miller thoreaus ideas influenced me greatly i adopted some of them and recommended the study of thoreau to all of my friends who were helping me in the cause of indian independence why i actually took the name of my movement from thoreaus essay on the duty of civil disobedience written about  years ago martin luther king jr noted in his autobiography that his first encounter with the idea of nonviolent resistance was reading on civil disobedience in  while attending morehouse college he wrote in his autobiography that it was here in this courageous new englanders refusal to pay his taxes and his choice of jail rather than support a war that would spread slaverys territory into mexico i made my first contact with the theory of nonviolent resistance fascinated by the idea of refusing to cooperate with an evil system i was so deeply moved that i reread the work several times i became convinced that noncooperation with evil is as much a moral obligation as is cooperation with good no other person has been more eloquent and passionate in getting this idea across than henry david thoreau as a result of his writings and personal witness we are the heirs of a legacy of creative protest the teachings of thoreau came alive in our civil rights movement indeed they are more alive than ever before whether expressed in a sitin at lunch counters a freedom ride into mississippi a peaceful protest in albany georgia a bus boycott in montgomery alabama these are outgrowths of thoreaus insistence that evil must be resisted and that no moral man can patiently adjust to injustice american psychologist b f skinner wrote that he carried a copy of thoreaus walden with him in his youth and in  wrote walden two a fictional utopia about  members of a community living together inspired by the life of thoreau thoreau and his fellow transcendentalists from concord were a major inspiration of the composer charles ives the th movement of the concord sonata for piano with a part for flute thoreaus instrument is a character picture and he also set thoreaus words actor ron thompson did a dramatic portrayal of henry david thoreau on the  nbc television series the rebels thoreaus ideas have impacted and resonated with various strains in the anarchist movement with emma goldman referring to him as the greatest american anarchist green anarchism and anarchoprimitivism in particular have both derived inspiration and ecological pointsofview from the writings of thoreau john zerzan included thoreaus text excursions  in his edited compilation of works in the anarchoprimitivist tradition titled against civilization readings and reflections additionally murray rothbard the founder of anarchocapitalism has opined that thoreau was one of the great intellectual heroes of his movement thoreau was also an important influence on latethcentury anarchist naturism globally thoreaus concepts also held importance within individualist anarchist circles in spain france and portugal criticismedit although his writings would receive widespread acclaim thoreaus ideas were not universally applauded scottish author robert louis stevenson judged thoreaus endorsement of living alone and apart from modern society in natural simplicity to be a mark of unmanly effeminacy and womanish solitude while deeming him a selfindulgent skulker nathaniel hawthorne had mixed feelings about thoreau he noted that he is a keen and delicate observer of nature—a genuine observer—which i suspect is almost as rare a character as even an original poet and nature in return for his love seems to adopt him as her especial child and shows him secrets which few others are allowed to witness  on the other hand he also wrote that thoreau repudiated all regular modes of getting a living and seems inclined to lead a sort of indian life among civilized men in a similar vein poet john greenleaf whittier detested what he deemed to be the wicked and heathenish message of walden claiming that thoreau wanted man to lower himself to the level of a woodchuck and walk on four legs in response to such criticisms english novelist george eliot writing for the westminster review characterized such critics as uninspired and narrowminded people—very wise in their own eyes—who would have every mans life ordered according to a particular pattern and who are intolerant of every existence the utility of which is not palpable to them may poohpooh mr thoreau and this episode in his history as unpractical and dreamy thoreau himself also responded to the criticism in a paragraph of his work walden by illustrating the irrelevance of their inquiries i should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of life which some would call impertinent though they do not appear to me at all impertinent but considering the circumstances very natural and pertinent some have asked what i got to eat if i did not feel lonesome if i was not afraid and the like others have been curious to learn what portion of my income i devoted to charitable purposes and some who have large families how many poor children i maintained  unfortunately i am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience moreover i on my side require of every writer first or last a simple and sincere account of his own life and not merely what he has heard of other mens lives  i trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat for it may do good service to him whom it fits recent criticism has accused thoreau of hypocrisy misanthropy and being sanctimonious based on his writings in walden although this criticism has been perceived as highly selective worksedit this list is incomplete you can help by expanding it henry david thoreau core works and topics civil disobedience herald of freedom the

october   read to the citizens of concord mass sunday evening october   i trust that you will pardon me for being here i do not wish to force my thoughts upon you but i feel forced myself little as i know of captain brown i would fain do my part to correct the tone and the statements of the newspapers and of my countrymen generally respecting his character and actions it costs us nothing to be just we can at least express our sympathy with and admiration of him and his companions and that is what i now propose to do first as to his history i will endeavor to omit as much as possible what you have already read i need not describe his person to you for probably most of you have seen and will not soon forget him i am told that his grandfather john brown was an officer in the revolution that he himself was born in connecticut about the beginning of this century but early went with his father to ohio i heard him say that his father was a contractor who furnished beef to the army there in the war of  that he accompanied him to the camp and assisted him in that employment seeing a good deal of military lifemore perhaps than if he had been a soldier for he was often present at the councils of the officers especially he learned by experience how armies are supplied and maintained in the fielda work which he observed requires at least as much experience and skill as to lead them in battle he said that few persons had any conception of the cost even the pecuniary cost of firing a single bullet in war he saw enough at any rate to disgust him with a military life indeed to excite in his a great abhorrence of it so much so that though he was tempted by the offer of some petty office in the army when he was about eighteen he not only declined that but he also refused to train when warned and was fined for it he then resolved that he would never have anything to do with any war unless it were a war for liberty when the troubles in kansas began he sent several of his sons thither to strengthen the party of the free state men fitting them out with such weapons as he had telling them that if the troubles should increase and there should be need of his he would follow to assist them with his hand and counsel this as you all know he soon after did and it was through his agency far more than any others that kansas was made free for a part of his life he was a surveyor and at one time he was engaged in woolgrowing and he went to europe as an agent about that business there as everywhere he had his eyes about him and made many original observations he said for instance that he saw why the soil of england was so rich and that of germany i think it was so poor and he thought of writing to some of the crowned heads about it it was because in england the peasantry live on the soil which they cultivate but in germany they are gathered into villages at night it is a pity that he did not make a book of his observations i should say that he was an oldfashioned man in respect for the constitution and his faith in the permanence of this union slavery he deemed to be wholly opposed to these and he was its determined foe he was by descent and birth a new england farmer a man of great commonsense deliberate and practical as that class is and tenfold more so he was like the best of those who stood at concord bridge once on lexington common and on bunker hill only he was firmer and higher principled than any that i have chanced to hear of as there it was no abolition lecturer that converted him ethan allen and stark with whom he may in some respects be compared were rangers in a lower and less important field they could bravely face their countrys foes but he had the courage to face his country herself when she was in the wrong a western writer says to account for his escape from so many perils that he was concealed under a rural exterior as if in that prairie land a hero should by good rights wear a citizens dress only he did not go to the college called harvard good old alma mater as she is he was not fed on the pap that is there furnished as he phrased it i know no more of grammar than one of your calves but he went to the great university of the west where he sedulously pursued the study of liberty for which he had early betrayed a fondness and having taken many degrees he finally commenced the public practice of humanity in kansas as you all know such were his humanities and not any study of grammar he would have left a greek accent slanting the wrong way and righted up a falling man he was one of that class of whom we hear a great deal but for the most part see nothing at allthe puritans it would be in vain to kill him he died lately in the time of cromwell but he reappeared here why should he not some of the puritan stock are said to have come over and settled in new england they were a class that did something else than celebrate their forefathers day and eat parched corn in remembrance of that time they were neither democrats nor republicans but men of simple habits straightforward prayerful not thinking much of rulers who did not fear god not making many compromises nor seeking after available candidates in his camp as one has recently written and as i have myself heard him state he permitted no profanity no man of loose morals was suffered to remain there unless indeed as a prisoner of war i would rather said he have the smallpox yellowfever and cholera all together in my camp than a man without principle it is a mistake sir that our people make when they think that bullies are the best fighters or that they are the fit men to oppose these southerners give me men of good principlesgodfearing menmen who respect themselves and with a dozen of them i will oppose any hundred such men as these buford ruffians he said that if one offered himself to be a soldier under him who was forward to tell what he could or would do if he could only get sight of the enemy he had but little confidence in him he was never able to find more than a score or so of recruits whom he would accept and only about a dozen among them his sons in whom he had perfect faith when he was here some years ago he showed to a few a little manuscript bookhis orderly book i think he called itcontaining the names of his company in kansas and the rules by which they bound themselves and he stated that several of them had already sealed the contract with their blood when some one remarked that with the addition of a chaplain it would have been a perfect cromwellian troop he observed that he would have been glad to add a chaplain to the list if he could have found one who could fill that office worthily it is easy enough to find one for the united states army i believe that he had prayers in his camp morning and evening nevertheless he was a man of spartan habits and at sixty was scrupulous about his diet at your table excusing himself by saying that he must eat sparingly and fare hard as became a soldier or one who was fitting himself for difficult enterprises a life of exposure a man of rare commonsense and directness of speech as of action a transcendentalist above all a man of ideas and principlesthat was what distinguished him not yielding to a whim or transient impulse but carrying out the purpose of a life i noticed that he did not overstate anything but spoke within bounds i remember particularly how in his speech here he referred to what his family had suffered in kansas without ever giving the least vent to his pentup fire it was a volcano with an ordinary chimneyflue also referring to the deeds of certain border ruffians he said rapidly paring away his speech like an experienced soldier keeping a reserve of force and meaning they had a perfect right to be hung he was not in the least a rhetorician was not talking to buncombe or his constituents anywhere had no need to invent anything but to tell the simple truth and communicate his own resolution therefore he appeared incomparably strong and eloquence in congress and elsewhere seemed to me at a discount it was like the speeches of cromwell compared with those of an ordinary king as for his tact and prudence i will merely say that at a time when scarcely a man from the free states was able to reach kansas by any direct route at least without having his arms taken from him he carrying what imperfect guns and other weapons he could collect openly and slowly drove an oxcart through missouri apparently in the capacity of a surveyor with his surveying compass exposed in it and so passed unsuspected and had ample opportunity to learn the designs of the enemy for some time after his arrival he still followed the same profession when for instance he saw a knot of the ruffians on the prairie discussing of course the single topic which then occupied their minds he would perhaps take his compass and one of his sons and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very spot on which that conclave had assembled and when he came up to them he would naturally pause and have some talk with them learning their news and at last all their plans perfectly and having thus completed his real survey he would resume his imaginary one and run on his line till he was out of sight when i expressed surprise that he could live in kansas at all with a price set upon his head and so large a number including the authorities exasperated against him he accounted for it by saying it is perfectly well understood that i will not be taken much of the time for some years he has had to skulk in swamps suffering from poverty and from sickness which was the consequence of exposure befriended only by indians and a few whites but though it might be known that he was lurking in a particular swamp his foes commonly did not care to go in after him he could even come out into a town where there were more border ruffians than free state men and transact some business without delaying long and yet not be molested for said he no little handful of men were willing to undertake it and a large body could not be got together in season as for his recent failure we do not know the facts about it it was evidently far from being a wild and desperate attempt his enemy mr vallandigham is compelled to say that it was among the best planned executed conspiracies that ever failed not to mention his other successes was it a failure or did it show a want of good management to deliver from bondage a dozen human beings and walk off with them by broad daylight for weeks if not months at a leisurely pace through one state after another for half the length of the north conspicuous to all parties with a price set upon his head going into a courtroom on his way and telling what he had done thus convincing missouri that it was not profitable to try to hold slaves in his neighborhoodand this not because the government menials were lenient but because they were afraid of him yet he did not attribute his success foolishly to his star or to any magic he said truly that the reason why such greatly superior numbers quailed before him was as one of his prisoners confessed because they lacked a causea kind of armor which he and his party never lacked when the time came few men were found willing to lay down their lives in defence of what they knew to be wrong they did not like that this should be their last act in this world but to make haste to his last act and its effects the newspapers seem to ignore or perhaps are really ignorant of the fact that there are at least as many as two or three individuals to a town throughout the north who think much as the present speaker does about him and his enterprise i do not hesitate to say that they are an important and growing party we aspire to be something more than stupid and timid chattels pretending to read history and our bibles but desecrating every house and every day we breathe in perhaps anxious politicians may prove that only seventeen white men and five negroes were concerned in the late enterprise but their very anxiety to prove this might suggest to themselves that all is not told why do they still dodge the truth they are so anxious because of a dim consciousness of the fact which they do not distinctly face that at least a million of the free inhabitants of the united states would have rejoiced if it had succeeded they at most only criticise the tactics though we wear no crape the thought of that mans position and probable fate is spoiling many a mans day here at the north for other thinking if any one who has seen him here can pursue successfully any other train of thought i do not know what he is made of if there is any such who gets his usual allowance of sleep i will warrant him to fatten easily under any circumstances which do not touch his body or purse i put a piece of paper and a pencil under my pillow and when i could not sleep i wrote in the dark on the whole my respect for my fellowmen except as one may outweigh a million is not being increased these days i have noticed the coldblooded way in which newspaper writers and men generally speak of this event as if an ordinary malefactor though one of unusual pluckas the governor of virginia is reported to have said using the language of the cockpit the gamest man he ever sawhad been caught and were about to be hung he was not dreaming of his foes when the governor thought he looked so brave it turns what sweetness i have to gall to hear or hear of the remarks of some of my neighbors when we heard at first that he was dead one of my townsmen observed that he died as the fool dieth which pardon me for an instant suggested a likeness in him dying to my neighbor living others cravenhearted said disparagingly that he threw his life away because he resisted the government which way have they thrown their lives praysuch as would praise a man for attacking singly an ordinary band of thieves or murderers i hear another ask yankeelike what will he gain by it as if he expected to fill his pockets by this enterprise such a one has no idea of gain but in this worldly sense if it does not lead to a surprise party if he does not get a new pair of boots or a vote of thanks it must be a failure but he wont gain anything by it well no i dont suppose he could get fourandsixpence a day for being hung take the year round but then he stands a chance to save a considerable part of his souland such a soulwhen you do not no doubt you can get more in your market for a quart of milk than for a quart of blood but that is not the market that heroes carry their blood to such do not know that like the seed is the fruit and that in the moral world when good seed is planted good fruit is inevitable and does not depend on our watering and cultivating that when you plant or bury a hero in his field a crop of heroes is sure to spring up this is a seed of such force and vitality that it does not ask our leave to germinate the momentary charge at balaclava in obedience to a blundering command proving what a perfect machine the soldier is has properly enough been celebrated by a poet laureate but the steady and for the most part successful charge of this man for some years against the legions of slavery in obedience to an infinitely higher command is as much more memorable than that as an intelligent and conscientious man is superior to a machine do you think that that will go unsung served him righta dangerous manhe is undoubtedly insane so they proceed to live their sane and wise and altogether admirable lives reading their plutarch a little but chiefly pausing at that feat of putnam who was let down into a wolfs den and in this wise they nourish themselves for brave and patriotic deeds some time or other the tract society could afford to print that story of putnam you might open the district schools with the reading of it for there is nothing about slavery or the church in it unless it occurs to the reader that some pastors are wolves in sheeps clothing the american board of commissioners for foreign missions even might dare to protest against that wolf i have heard of boards and of american boards but it chances that i never heard of this particular lumber till lately and yet i hear of northern men and women and children by families buying a life membership in such societies as these a lifemembership in the grave you can get buried cheaper than that our foes are in our midst and all about us there is hardly a house but is divided against itself for our foe is the all but universal woodenness of both head and heart the want of vitality in man which is the effect of our vice and hence are begotten fear superstition bigotry persecution and slavery of all kinds we are mere figureheads upon a hulk with livers in the place of hearts the curse is the worship of idols which at length changes the worshipper into a stone image himself and the newenglander is just as much an idolater as the hindoo this man was an exception for he did not set up even a political graven image between him and his god a church that can never have done with excommunicating christ while it exists away with your broad and flat churches and your narrow and tall churches take a step forward and invent a new style of outhouses invent a salt that will save you and defend our nostrils the modern christian is a man who has consented to say all the prayers in the liturgy provided you will let him go straight to bed and sleep quietly afterward all his prayers begin with now i lay me down to sleep and he is forever looking forward to the time when he shall go to his long rest he has consented to perform certain oldestablished charities too after a fashion but he does not wish to hear of any newfangled ones he doesnt wish to have any supplementary articles added to the contract to fit it to the present time he shows the whites of his eyes on the sabbath and the blacks all the rest of the week the evil is not merely a stagnation of blood but a stagnation of spirit many no doubt are well disposed but sluggish by constitution and by habit and they cannot conceive of a man who is actuated by higher motives than they are accordingly they pronounce this man insane for they know that they could never act as he does as long as they are themselves we dream of foreign countries of other times and races of men placing them at a distance in history or space but let some significant event like the present occur in our midst and we discover often this distance and this strangeness between us and our nearest neighbors they are our austrias and chinas and south sea islands our crowded society becomes well spaced all at once clean and handsome to the eyea city of magnificent distances we discover why it was that we never got beyond compliments and surfaces with them before we become aware of as many versts between us and them as there are between a wandering tartar and a chinese town the thoughtful man becomes a hermit in the thoroughfares of the marketplace impassable seas suddenly find their level between us or dumb steppes stretch themselves out there it is the difference of constitution of intelligence and faith and not streams and mountains that make the true and impassable boundaries between individuals and between states none but the likeminded can come plenipotentiary to our court i read all the newspapers i could get within a week after this event and i do not remember in them a single expression of sympathy for these men i have since seen one noble statement in a boston paper not editorial some voluminous sheets decided not to print the full report of browns words to the exclusion of other matter it was as if a publisher should reject the manuscript of the new testament and print wilsons last speech the same journal which contained this pregnant news was chiefly filled in parallel columns with the reports of the political conventions that were being held but the descent to them was too steep they should have been spared this contrastbeen printed in an extra at least to turn from the voices and deeds of earnest men to the cackling of political conventions officeseekers and speechmakers who do not so much as lay an honest egg but wear their breasts bare upon an egg of chalk their great game is the game of straws or rather that universal aboriginal game of the platter at which the indians cried hub bub exclude the reports of religious and political conventions and publish the words of a living man but i object not so much to what they have omitted as to what they have inserted even the liberator called it a misguided wild and apparently insaneeffort as for the herd of newspapers and magazines i do not chance to know an editor in the country who will deliberately print anything which he knows will ultimately and permanently reduce the number of his subscribers they do not believe that it would be expedient how then can they print truth if we do not say pleasant things they argue nobody will attend to us and so they do like some travelling auctioneers who sing an obscene song in order to draw a crowd around them republican editors obliged to get their sentences ready for the morning edition and accustomed to look at everything by the twilight of politics express no admiration nor true sorrow even but call these men deluded fanaticsmistaken meninsane or crazed it suggests what a sane set of editors we are blessed with not mistaken men who know very well on which side their bread is buttered at least a man does a brave and humane deed and at once on all sides we hear people and parties declaring i didnt do it nor countenance him to do it in any conceivable way it cant be fairly inferred from my past career i for one am not interested to hear you define your position i dont know that i ever was or ever shall be i think it is mere egotism or impertinent at this time ye neednt take so much pains to wash your skirts of him no intelligent man will ever be convinced that he was any creature of yours he went and came as he himself informs us under the auspices of john brown and nobody else the republican party does not perceive how many his failure will make to vote more correctly than they would have them they have counted the votes of pennsylvania  co but they have not correctly counted captain browns vote he has taken the wind out of their sailsthe little wind they hadand they may as well lie to and repair what though he did not belong to your clique though you may not approve of his method or his principles recognize his magnanimity would you not like to claim kindredship with him in that though in no other thing he is like or likely to you do you think that you would lose your reputation so what you lost at the spile you would gain at the bung if they do not mean all this then they do not speak the truth and say what they mean they are simply at their old tricks still it was always conceded to him says one who calls him crazy that he was a conscientious man very modest in his demeanor apparently inoffensive until the subject of slavery was introduced when he would exhibit a feeling of indignation unparalleled the slaveship is on her way crowded with its dying victims new cargoes are being added in midocean a small crew of slaveholders countenanced by a large body of passengers is smothering four millions under the hatches and yet the politician asserts that the only proper way by which deliverance is to be obtained is by the quiet diffusion of the sentiments of humanity without any outbreak as if the sentiments of humanity were ever found unaccompanied by its deeds and you could disperse them all finished to order the pure article as easily as water with a wateringpot and so lay the dust what is that that i hear cast overboard the bodies of the dead that have found deliverance that is the way we are diffusing humanity and its sentiments with it prominent and influential editors accustomed to deal with politicians men of an infinitely lower grade say in their ignorance that he acted on the principle of revenge they do not know the man they must enlarge themselves to conceive of him i have no doubt that the time will come when they will begin to see him as he was they have got to conceive of a man of faith and of religious principle and not a politician or an indian of a man who did not wait till he was personally interfered with or thwarted in some harmless business before he gave his life to the cause of the oppressed if walker may be considered the representative of the south i wish i could say that brown was the representative of the north he was a superior man he did not value his bodily life in comparison with ideal things he did not recognize unjust human laws but resisted them as he was bid for once we are lifted out of the trivialness and dust of politics into the region of truth and manhood no man in america has ever stood up so persistently and effectively for the dignity of human nature knowing himself for a man and the equal of any and all governments in that sense he was the most american of us all he needed no babbling lawyer making false issues to defend him he was more than a match for all the judges that american voters or officeholders of whatever grade can create he could not have been tried by a jury of his peers because his peers did not exist when a man stands up serenely against the condemnation and vengeance of mankind rising above them literally by a whole bodyeven though he were of late the vilest murderer who has settled that matter with himselfthe spectacle is a sublime onedidnt ye know it ye liberators ye tribunes ye republicansand we become criminal in comparison do yourselves the honor to recognize him he needs none of your respect as for the democratic journals they are not human enough to affect me at all i do not feel indignation at anything they may say i am aware that i anticipate a littlethat he was still at the last accounts alive in the hands of his foes but that being the case i have all along found myself thinking and speaking of him as physically dead i do not believe in erecting statues to those who still live in our hearts whose bones have not yet crumbled in the earth around us but i would rather see the statue of captain brown in the massachusetts statehouse yard than that of any other man whom i know i rejoice that i live in this age that i am his contemporary what a contrast when we turn to that political party which is so anxiously shuffling him and his plot out of its way and looking around for some available slave holder perhaps to be its candidate at least for one who will execute the fugitive slave law and all those other unjust laws which he took up arms to annul insane a father and six sons and one soninlaw and several more men besidesas many at least as twelve disciplesall struck with insanity at once while the same tyrant holds with a firmer gripe than ever his four millions of slaves and a thousand sane editors his abettors are saving their country and their bacon just as insane were his efforts in kansas ask the tyrant who is his most dangerous foe the sane man or the insane do the thousands who know him best who have rejoiced at his deeds in kansas and have afforded him material aid there think him insane such a use of this word is a mere trope with most who persist in using it and i have no doubt that many of the rest have already in silence retracted their words read his admirable answers to mason and others how they are dwarfed and defeated by the contrast on the one side halfbrutish halftimid questioning on the other truth clear as lightning crashing into their obscene temples they are made to stand with pilate and gesler and the inquisition how ineffectual their speech and action and what a void their silence they are but helpless tools in this great work it was no human power that gathered them about this preacher what have massachusetts and the north sent a few sane representatives to congress for of late yearsto declare with effect what kind of sentiments all their speeches put together and boiled downand probably they themselves will confess itdo not match for manly directness and force and for simple truth the few casual remarks of crazy john brown on the floor of the harpers ferry enginehousethat man whom you are about to hang to send to the other world though not to represent you there no he was not our representative in any sense he was too fair a specimen of a man to represent the like of us who then were his constituents if you read his words understandingly you will find out in his case there is no idle eloquence no made nor maiden speech no compliments to the oppressor truth is his inspirer and earnestness the polisher of his sentences he could afford to lose his sharpes rifles while he retained his faculty of speecha sharpes rifle of infinitely surer and longer range and the new york herald reports the conversation verbatim it does not know of what undying words it is made the vehicle i have no respect for the penetration of any man who can read the report of that conversation and still call the principal in it insane it has the ring of a saner sanity than an ordinary discipline and habits of life than an ordinary organization secure take any sentence of itany questions that i can honorably answer i will not otherwise so far as i am myself concerned i have told everything truthfully i value my word sir the few who talk about his vindictive spirit while they really admire his heroism have no test by which to detect a noble man no amalgam to combine with his pure gold they mix their own dross with it it is a relief to turn from these slanders to the testimony of his more truthful but frightened jailers and hangmen governor wise speaks far more justly and appreciatingly of him than any northern editor or politician or public personage that i chance to have heard from i know that you can afford to hear him again on this subject he says they are themselves mistaken who take him to be madman he is cool collected and indomitable and it is but just to him to say that he was humane to his prisoners and he inspired me with great trust in his integrity as a man of truth he is a fanatic vain and garrulous i leave that part to mr wise but firm truthful and intelligent his men too who survive are like him colonel washington says that he was the coolest and firmest man he ever saw in defying danger and death with one son dead by his side and another shot through he felt the pulse of his dying son with one hand and held his rifle with the other and commanded his men with the utmost composure encouraging them to be firm and to sell their lives as dear as they could of the three white prisoners brown stephens and coppic it was hard to say which was most firm almost the first northern men whom the slaveholder has learned to respect the testimony of mr vallandigham though less valuable is of the same purport that it is vain to underrate either the man or his conspiracy he is the farthest possible removed from the ordinary ruffian fanatic or madman all is quiet at harpers ferry say the journals what is the character of that calm which follows when the law and the slaveholder prevail i regard this event as a touchstone designed to bring out with glaring distinctness the character of this government we needed to be thus assisted to see it by the light of history it needed to see itself when a government puts forth its strength on the side of injustice as ours to maintain slavery and kill the liberators of the slave it reveals itself a merely brute force or worse a demoniacal force it is the head of the pluguglies it is more manifest than ever that tyranny rules i see this government to be effectually allied with france and austria in oppressing mankind there sits a tyrant holding fettered four millions of slaves here comes their heroic liberator this most hypocritical and diabolical government looks up from its seat on the gasping four millions and inquires with an assumption of innocence what do you assault me for am i not an honest man cease agitation on this subject or i will make a slave of you too or else hang you we talk about a representative government but what a monster of a government is that where the noblest faculties of the mind and the whole heart are not represented a semihuman tiger or ox stalking over the earth with its heart taken out and the top of its brain shot away heroes have fought well on their stumps when their legs were shot off but i never heard of any good done by such a government as that the only government that i recognizeand it matters not how few are at the head of it or how small its armyis that power that establishes justice in the land never that which establishes injustice what shall we think of a government to which all the truly brave and just men in the land are enemies standing between it and those whom it oppresses a government that pretends to be christian and crucifies a million christs every day treason where does such treason take its rise i cannot help thinking of you as you deserve ye governments can you dry up the fountains of thought high treason when it is resistance to tyranny here below has its origin in and is first committed by the power that makes and forever recreates man when you have caught and hung all these human rebels you have accomplished nothing but your own guilt for you have not struck at the fountainhead you presume to contend with a foe against whom west point cadets and rifled cannon point not can all the art of the cannonfounder tempt matter to turn against its maker is the form in which the founder thinks he casts it more essential than the constitution of it and of himself the united states have a coffle of four millions of slaves they are determined to keep them in this condition and massachusetts is one of the confederated overseers to prevent their escape such are not all the inhabitants of massachusetts but such are they who rule and are obeyed here it was massachusetts as well as virginia that put down this insurrection at harpers ferry she sent the marines there and she will have to pay the penalty of her sin suppose that there is a society in this state that out of its own purse and magnanimity saves all the fugitive slaves that run to us and protects our colored fellowcitizens and leaves the other work to the government socalled is not that government fast losing its occupation and becoming contemptible to mankind if private men are obliged to perform the offices of government to protect the weak and dispense justice then the government becomes only a hired man or clerk to perform menial or indifferent services of course that is but the shadow of a government who existence necessitates a vigilant committee what should we think of the oriental cadi even behind whom worked in secret a vigilant committee but such is the character of our northern states generally each has its vigilant committee and to a certain extent these crazy governments recognize and accept this relation they say virtually well be glad to work for you on these terms only dont make a noise about it and thus the government its salary being insured withdraws into the back shop taking the constitution with it and bestows most of its labor on repairing that when i hear it at work sometimes as i go by it reminds me at best of those farmers who in winter contrive to turn a penny by following the coopering business and what kind of spirit is their barrel made to hold they speculate in stocks and bore holes in mountains but they are not competent to lay out even a decent highway the only free road the underground railroad is owned and managed by the vigilant committee they have tunnelled under the whole breadth of the land such a government is losing its power and respectability as surely as water runs out of a leaky vessel and is held by one that can contain it i hear many condemn these men because they were so few when were the good and the brave ever in a majority would you have had him wait till that time cametill you and i came over to him the very fact that he had no rabble or troop of hirelings about him would alone distinguish him from ordinary heroes his company was small indeed because few could be found worthy to pass muster each one who there laid down his life for the poor and oppressed was a picked man culled out of many thousands if not millions apparently a man of principle of rare courage and devoted humanity ready to sacrifice his life at any moment for so much by laymen as by ministers of the gospel not so much by the fighting sects as by the quakers and not so much by quaker men as by quaker women this event advertises me that there is such a fact as deaththe possibility of a mans dying it seems as if no man had ever died in america before for in order to die you must first have lived i dont believe in the hearses and palls and funerals that they have had there was no death in the case because there had been no life they merely rotted or sloughed off pretty much as they had rotted or sloughed along no temples veil was rent only a hole dug somewhere let the dead bury their dead the best of them fairly ran down like a clock franklinwashingtonthey were let off without dying they were merely missing one day i hear a good many pretend that they are going to die or that they have died for aught that i know nonsense ill defy them to do it they havent got life enough in them theyll deliquesce like fungi and keep a hundred eulogists mopping the spot where they left off only half a dozen or so have died since the world began do you think that you are going to die sir no theres no hope of you you havent got your lesson yet youve got to stay after school we make a needless ado about capital punishmenttaking lives when there is no life to take memento mori we dont understand that sublime sentence which some worthy got sculptured on his gravestone once weve interpreted it in a grovelling and snivelling sense weve wholly forgotten how to die but be sure you do die nevertheless do your work and finish it if you know how to begin you will know when to end these men in teaching us how to die have at the same time taught us how to live if this mans acts and words do not create a revival it will be the severest possible satire on the acts and words that do it is the best news that america has ever heard it has already quickened the feeble pulse of the north and infused more and more generous blood into her veins and heart than any number of years of what is called commercial and political prosperity could how many a man who was lately contemplating suicide has now something to live for one writer says that browns peculiar monomania made him to be dreaded by the missourians as a supernatural being sure enough a hero in the midst of us cowards is always so dreaded he is just that thing he shows himself superior to nature he has a spark of divinity in him unless above himself he can erect himself how poor a thing is man newspaper editors argue also that it is a proof of his insanity that he thought he was appointed to do this work which he didthat he did not suspect himself for a moment they talk as if it were impossible that a man could be divinely appointed in these days to do any work whatever as if vows and religion were out of date as connected with any mans daily work as if the agent to abolish slavery could only be somebody appointed by the president or by some political party they talk as if a mans death were a failure and his continued life be it of whatever character were a success when i reflect to what a cause this man devoted himself and how religiously and then reflect to what cause his judges and all who condemn him so angrily and fluently devote themselves i see that they are as far apart as the heavens and earth are asunder the amount of it is our leading men are a harmless kind of folk and they know well enough that they were not divinely appointed but elected by the votes of their party who is it whose safety requires that captain brown be hung is it indispensable to any northern man is there no resource but to cast this man also to the minotaur if you do not wish it say so distinctly while these things are being done beauty stands veiled and music is a screeching lie think of himof his rare qualitiessuch a man as it takes ages to make and ages to understand no mock hero nor the representative of any party a man such as the sun may not rise upon again in this benighted land to whose making went the costliest material the finest adamant sent to be the redeemer of those in captivity and the only use to which you can put him is to hang him at the end of a rope you who pretend to care for christ crucified consider what you are about to do to him who offered himself to be the savior of four millions of men any man knows when he is justified and all the wits in the world cannot enlighten him on that point the murderer always knows that he is justly punished but when a government takes the life of a man without the consent of his conscience it is an audacious government and is taking a step towards its own dissolution is it not possible that an individual may be right and a government wrong are laws to be enforced simply because they were made or declared by any number of men to be good if they are not good is there any necessity for a mans being a tool to perform a deed of which his better nature disapproves is it the intention of lawmakers that good men shall be hung ever are judges to interpret the law according to the letter and not the spirit what right have you to enter into a compact with yourself that you will do thus or so against the light within you is it for you to make up your mindto form any resolution whateverand not accept the convictions that are forced upon you and which ever pass your understanding i do not believe in lawyers in that mode of attacking or defending a man because you descend to meet the judge on his own ground and in cases of the highest importance it is of no consequence whether a man breaks a human law or not let lawyers decide trivial cases business men may arrange that among themselves if they were the interpreters of the everlasting laws which rightfully bind man that would be another thing a counterfeiting lawfactory standing half in a slave land and half in free what kind of laws for free men can you expect from that i am here to plead his cause with you i plead not for his life but for his characterhis immortal life and so it becomes your cause wholly and is not his in the least some eighteen hundred years ago christ was crucified this morning perchance captain brown was hung these are the two ends of a chain which is not without its links he is not old brown any longer he is an angel of light i see now that it was necessary that the bravest and humanest man in all the country should be hung perhaps he saw it himself i almost fear that i may yet hear of his deliverance doubting if a prolonged life if any life can do as much good as his death misguided garrulous insane vindictive so ye write in your easychairs and thus he wounded responds from the floor of the armory clear as a cloudless sky true as the voice of nature is no man sent me here it was my own prompting and that of my maker i acknowledge no master in human form and in what a sweet and noble strain he proceeds addressing his captors who stand over him i think my friends you are guilty of a great wrong against god and humanity and it would be perfectly right for any one to interfere with you so far as to free those you willfully and wickedly hold in bondage and referring to his movement it is in my opinion the greatest service a man can render to god i pity the poor in bondage that have none to help them that is why i am here not to gratify any personal animosity revenge or vindictive spirit it is my sympathy with the oppressed and the wronged that are as good as you and as precious in the sight of god you dont know your testament when you see it i want you to understand that i respect the rights of the poorest and weakest of colored people oppressed by the slave power just as much as i do those of the most wealthy and powerful i wish to say furthermore that you had better all you people at the south prepare yourselves for a settlement of that question that must come up for settlement sooner than your are prepared for it the sooner you are prepared the better you may dispose of me very easily i am nearly disposed of now but this question is still to be settledthis negro question i mean the end of that is not yet i foresee the time when the painter will paint that scene no longer going to rome for a subject the poet will sing it the historian record it and with the landing of the pilgrims and the declaration of independence it will be the ornament of some future national gallery when at least the present form of slavery shall be no more here we shall then be at liberty to weep for captain brown then and not till then we will take our revenge historical treatises avalon home document collections ancient bce   medieval    th century    th century    th century    th century    th century
