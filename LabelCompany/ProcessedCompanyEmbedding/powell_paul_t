oldest first newest first show   per pagea must for pools or cement parkssmooooooooth— mikehey there georgeso far so good ive really been stoked on all the reissues that youve been putting out lately ive already bought both the vallely and kevin harris decks but im dying to get ahold of a rodney mullen chessboard reissuei think that powell once had the strongest most recognizable image back during the the mid to late s most of this was due to the iconic graphics that only vcj could have created ive often wondered what hes been up to these days and if hed ever consider creating skateboard graphics again i think its about time the world was reintroduced to his art again many thanks— crab scramblyat last long last i emailed you a year ago with the thin hope of getting the ray bones snub nose reissued and here it is this was my alltime favorite board back in the s but i never got one after waiting  years here it is thanks a bunch— braden smithi think if chin made a speech he would say any man or woman could parachute once but you would need a parachute to parachute twice life is animal chin k s yrs old and still love bones thank you for keeping skateboarding fun pp is — kelly dyerso very awesome to be able to get my hands on all my old faves on dvd and the video tunes shoulda been here  years ago im in my early s now and walking into skate shops asking for animal chin and pd is a frustrating experience as the guys behind the counter dont know what im talkin bout cheers boys— ben evansits great to see the reissue of boards we have known to love im a geezen   but grew up in nva and skated the ditch chicken ranch mt trashmore and a slew of other little hot spots one place that sticks out was this guy page had a pink half pipe in n little rock arkthat was glassed that thing was sofaking sweet you guys remember when thrasher was nothing more than news print and chief rasta where you could get some recipe to fill your belly well sorry to be geezen on ya peace do you really have to ask— scotti havent had a board that i really loved to skate since my frankie hill was regretfully retired from service in about  but now thanks to powell i have a vallely and a kevin harris freestyle my skating has returned to how it was before those evil popsicle decks started breeding thanks to everybody at skate one please dont ever stop making these reissues you are making the world a better place— paul sullivanthanks so much for the great reissue decksit is great to see them available please reissue frankie hills bulldog deck and tony hawks  skull deck keep going with your great classic powell products they are great— karlhi dudes i just got on the web page by pure hazard well anyway i stopped skating after some really painful experiences but guys i wanted to thank you for what you have released over the years definitely and adept of pp products i will never forget all those years watching the bones brigade and trying to get as good as them well i really want to get back on a skate but now i dont have the confidence that i had when i was  thanks again— rno tamperethe ratbones are the perfect pool wheel they grip like no other and make it a pleasure to ride— graham crawleyi was  in  when i started riding skateboards down at the end of the road was a friend who had made a half pipe ramp that was perfect he named it rampage and he road the ray bones powell peralta it was the coolest board i had ever seen i believe the color was white with red design and white bones wheels i dreamed about having this board i never was fortunate enough to buy one but when i saw your reissues page i immediately had to have one i have even decked it out with dbl cons and tracker trucks i wanted some old pizza grip but cannot find so had to settle for clear madrid it wont get ridden to much i believe it will be more of a showcase for the wall keep those reissues coming they might not be originals but to me they were works of art and i dont mind owning a reproduction— scott drewthank you for reissuing this wonderful line quality vintage material and decksthere seems to be a real craving for it how about some womens tees with the vintage logos and hopefully a restocking of the general product line thank you thank you thank you from a skateratette with great memories of the s scene o— jamieim  years old and surf the snow out here in colorado but i was bred in cali and skated the monty back in the day even on half pipes i used to skate the chicken ranch in nor cal for my birthday im getting a powell board— mike fitzgeraldhey i have the steve steadham reissue deck it is sooo sick i love it so much you guys really did a good job on it and i love the spoon nose on it i wish the new rasta one had that thanks for making these decks for everyone to enjoy including me a  year old that loves old skool decks and culture peace— jeffreyguys long story short im  and saw the reissues and got a ripper just to ride and carve that turned into going to the skatepark and now im riding ramps just like  years ago skating is one of the many freedoms that got lost in all the things that i was conditioned to believe were important thanks for the wakeup call keep up the great work— greg minori was a member of cherry hill skateboard park in  i seen stacy skate there along with the rest of themincluding jamie godfrey the park pro i seen him skate evey friday if i only newi had the yellow snub with red skullthe cubesthe tracker six trackscopersthe hole please put out some with the red skull and swordit brings back so much memories and i still skate at this yellow and white one is very sweet to cant wait to get a couplethanks so much for still being around— mike buntsawesome boards i wasnt born when the originals were made so im really excited about these reissues but there is one thing that would be better than all these boards together and that is a reissue of the per welinder nordic skull deck pleasebest wishes— johannes oknerthey dont make them like they use to but they make them better— travisyou guys still make what is basically the original freestyle wheel you produced for the roller skate market so why not rerelease for the freestyle market like the rat bones and cubics there are only a couple freestyle wheels on the market and none of them have that good square edge the original powell freestyle wheel had— jeremy elderim another something rider im totally stoked to see my favorite board reissued these new school popsicle stick boards just dont cut it for me thanks— jd mellowship items  of  page    sort by
