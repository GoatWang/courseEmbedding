presidency what should investors think november   we never expected to write the words “president trump” in any commentary but that is where we are today it has been an extraordinary election campaign that has left many clients friends and family concerned disheartened and perhaps afraid it is at moments like this that we have to distance ourselves from the passion of the moment and reframe the issue emotional considerations aside where is the real risk the bottom line is this in the aftermath of the trump victory we have greater uncertainty which will entail lower economic growth rates and higher premiums for risky assets during the past few years we have witnessed a continued movement in market prices towards safety resulting in a considerable sacrifice of potential upside corporations have continued to amass record amounts of cash as a cushion against another downturn investors have withdrawn money from equities and sought the perceived safety of fixed income in switzerland the entire yield curve is negative meaning investors buying swiss government bonds in fact pay for the privilege instead of earning from it even investing your money for  years in swiss bonds yields nothing with the election of trump it is unlikely that any of these situations will change soon in general things never turn out as badly as you might fear even if president trump wants to enact some of his election promises he will have to work through congress to get the bills passed in the past we have seen many governments and presidents come and go without a dramatic impact on business the problem today is that we can easily envision a number of bleak outcomes initially as with brexit we suspect that the markets will stabilize because very little will change in the short run but leaving aside social and moral judgements we believe that in this economic environment the investment risks are somewhat greater ¬– not so much from a legislative perspective but from an economic policy perspective for us the real concern is what will occur in the event that slower us growth slips into a recession let’s look at how this could play out over the next few years first we expect that at some point during the next year trump will announce a replacement for janet yellen the current chair of the federal reserve whose term expires in february  her replacement could be someone without the experience or credentials that all federal reserve presidents in recent memory possess moreover trump has indicated that he would like to reform the fed which may well compromise its traditional independence it is likely that the replacement will be much more beholden to the president and even the republican party which implies a greater focus on inflation and less on the goal of full employment second if the economy moves into recession what will be the likely policy response from president trump the average decline in interest rates during previous recessions has been about  the federal reserve does not have the ability to drop rates further previously we would have expected the government to step in and increase spending to stimulate the economy however it is more likely that a businessman and republican will try to restore confidence by cutting spending in a recession when government revenues are declining the result could be a long and particularly nasty economic slowdown we are not forecasting this outcome however the possibility of such a scenario is higher now for investors managing risk though judicious equity selection and geographic exposure will be even more important as uncertainty rises investors can not blithely assume that the us economy will be the engine of growth that it once was because the possibility of policy mistakes is higher our expectations are that economic growth will continue to disappoint be revised lower and interest rates as a consequence will remain low at cidel we will reexamine our allocations and individual investments in light of this event as we continually do to determine appropriate changes in this new environment arthur heinmaa chief investment officer asset management comments on the uk referendum june   in a huge surprise the uk voted to leave the european union this decision immediately reverberated through global financial markets with sterling dropping over  versus the us dollar dropping to a  year low equity markets declining over  and the  year bond rising  to put things in perspective the dow jones industrials were up  points in the previous  days and are expected to lose  points at today’s opening where financial markets will settle is still unknown but we wanted to share some of our initial thoughts on this historic day  is this the beginning of another financial crisis this is not another lehman the voting results surprised yesterday’s consensus resulting in dramatic shortterm moves in the market but this decision in no way undermines the financial system the banking system today is better capitalized and less leveraged than at any time in recent memory this vote is not the same as the financial crisis of  investors should not liquidate their portfolios thinking that we are on the brink of a financial collapse what we have experienced is a global repricing of financial assets based on the prospects for lower growth in the future  what are the key things to consider in our view there are three important features of this vote to consider first the vote is clearly a vote against the establishment  almost universally economists business leaders and academics supported and campaigned for the remain side despite the reasoned logical arguments put forth by the remain side voters rejected those arguments and instead sided with the populist antiimmigration antieurope leave campaign indeed those cheering the results are none other than donald trump marie le pen and frauke pettry alternative for germany all of whom are campaigning as the antiestablishment candidates in their countries second there was a dramatic split between the young under  and the old over  with the young voting almost  in favour of remaining in the eu and an equally large portion of the older population voting to leave in the abstract this result is disheartening because the younger population will have to live with a decision that they clearly did not want only time will tell if this decision lingers in the minds of younger voters when it comes time to make decisions on pensions and healthcare for retirees third there was a large split in the vote between the large urban areas and the rural areas london edinburgh liverpool and  manchester all voted to stay with the bulk of the smaller regions voting to leave the polarization of voting was remarkable and we think it is an indication of how the smaller regions believe that they have been bypassed in this new era of globalization this pattern of voting is not unique to the uk   it is likely that we will see a similar pattern in spain on june th and in the us this fall this polarization between the young and old urban and rural and the establishment and populists will only increase political uncertainty in any future election all of which will make it riskier for corporations to make longer term capital commitments  what are the consequences for the economy overall we should expect lower growth in the future in times of market turbulence we regularly look at what is happening in the fixed income markets to validate or refute what is happening in equity markets the us long bond dropped from a yield of  to  in the space of a few hours it might seem like a minor move but in fixed income markets this move is nothing short of remarkable it is a clear indication that the expectation will be for lower growth and lower rates for a longer period of time the reasons for lower growth are straightforward and both are rooted in the uncertainty surrounding the timing terms and conditions of the uk exiting the euro corporations in europe or doing business in europe will be more cautious and will delay or slow investment in that region until the terms of business are clear given the size of the european economy this will have an impact on the prospects for global growth for the individual particularly in europe our suspicion is that they will be more risk averse and accumulate savings rather than spending or investing this situation will act as a brake on growth and might drive interest rates even lower throughout the european area and the rest of the developed world  should i adjust my portfolio the answer is no the instinct to run to cash is always powerful in times of uncertainty and it is important to fight that sentiment and stick to a disciplined plan rarely do short term emotional decisions work out well one can’t trade on yesterday’s prices so the decisions must be based on what the prices are today and more importantly what they might be in the future hence the important activity will be to incorporate this new reality into our valuation models and make appropriate changes to holdings and asset allocations if required the past twentyfour hours have been unlike anything we have seen since the uk withdrew from the european exchange rate mechanism erm we will continue to monitor markets and will make changes to your portfolios only if it is warranted by
