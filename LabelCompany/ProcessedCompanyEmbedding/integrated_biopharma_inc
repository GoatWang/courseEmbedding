new way to fight cancer a new way to fight cancer share tweet link email print it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer but what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients including kidney and lung cancer in fact research from the american association for cancer research shows that for advancedmelanoma patients survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer tweet biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types with  medicines and vaccines in development for cancer  percent of which have the potential to be

medicines watch the video we cannot take progress for granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here related news

link email print “my entire world sort of clicked off i didnt hear anything i didnt see anything and the only thing that i could think of was im going to be dead in six months” this is james looking back at  the year the dow closed above  the hubble space telescope was turned on and james was diagnosed with hiv “im a survivor of domestic violence child molestation depression” he says with some pride even so james knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life  after all while hivaids awareness was still relatively new in  james was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger “first there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body” james says “a person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week”  james also explained that since doctors had just begun researching hiv there were almost no treatment options available “the medication at the time was fairly nonexistent” he recalls of the side effects he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself”  thanks to years of investment and hard work by america’s biopharmaceutical companies and other health care stakeholders things have changed dramatically – and patients likes james who can look back  years in neardisbelief are proof  brian a researcher developing hivaids medications for nearly  years is astounded by how far treatment has come “the progress is actually quite miraculous” he says “in the early days the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible  resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients but the alternative was death  frankly both options were horrible  fast forward  years and now we have several onepill onceaday treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from”   “they can live a normal life – a healthy successful life”  today the outlook has never been more promising with more than  medicines and vaccines in development to treat prevent or help with the disease impact of hivaids  as brian explains treatment is no longer simply about survival but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had “it is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting that the new medicines weve brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them” james understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back “my family my doctors who were trying to make sure that i got the right medications to keep me going” he says “the programs that helped me find housing sent me back to school and helped me to better myself”   “i have a great doctor most of doctors that ive had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic  we have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic”  james’s experience motivated him to help others he began volunteering at san francisco city hall by taking calls helping around the office and any job in between this volunteer work led to hiv community activism – and a run for office while he may not have won his election james continued to give back to others providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received  james recently lost his partner to aids and his brother to cancer still he knew he had to keep moving forward  “the thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day” he says “i will get back up”  brian knows there’s still a long way to go “there are people who are alive today because of the work that we do” he acknowledges “the work is often very quiet very slow moving very frustrating but over time it has a major impact on thousands of people” and brian sees even greater hope ahead “i dont take no for an answer” he says “the power of imagination and innovation is incredible and i see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues”  “science is real and the key to solving problems we just need to find the right people to bring together collaborate and find a solution”   james is grateful for brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity “im not sure how to explain it any better” he says “than it just makes me feel a little more normal” related news living with hiv eric’s
