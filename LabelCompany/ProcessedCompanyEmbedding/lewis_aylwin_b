aylwin b lewis chief executive officer president sears holdings corporation  beverly road hoffman estates il  dear mr lewis it is out of frustration that i write you ive had better than  phone conversations with sears representatives concerning the below abbreviated problem i have been mislead inconvenienced told untruths denied satisfaction hung up on not called back etc yesterday being totally disgusted i accepted a token  gift certificate just to get off the phone this is not good for me or for sears for  plus years i have purchased sears products from clothes and tools through large kenmore appliances rarely have i had a problem always resolved until now a superior customer relationship has been violated and diminished in  we purchased a craftsman leaf blower  after several uses  it stopped working this unit was replaced under warranty  from then until  this replacement unit sat brand new in my gardening workroom never used on  i used it to vacuum one of our outside decks these decks are usually power washed this blower was run at most  minutes and then shut off temporarily it would not start again i called sears  and was switched to sara very knowledgeable no spark or compression take it to the sears repair operation sara said this unit has a recall status for bad piston cylinder issues i will not be charged for repair even though the unit is out of warranty i dropped the unit off the next day my home phone number is xxxxxxxxxx and you can trace the many calls and history associated with this blower service repair  in  plus weeks i made sure the recall notation was noted on the service order a few days passed and fontana ca repair technician ashlee called me sure enough the piston cylinder was in fact damaged there was no recall and i must pay  to repair the unit i explained it was brand new she agreed it looked new and not used ashlee also said that my gas fuel mixture was fine and that the damage was probably caused by a broken piece of metal within the engine several calls were made to locate sara the recall person not findable within  call centers and  employees nothing was ever documented on the sears side in fact of the several sears employees i did subsequently speak with few made documentation of our conversations sara ashlee kevin sharon adrianna scott tom  ann  gloria julian to name a few i was transferred many many times and even hung up on by scott on  i left  messages for kevin price director of home services  he never called back i was told he is too busy and travels a lot i guess im not too busy switched from kevin prices office on  i filed a complaint with gloria i was to receive a call back within  hours it never came mr lewis i do hope you value my time more than kevin price more importantly i sincerely hope you value our business relationship please replace this defective leaf blower and from one business owner to a business executive please fix sears communication and

year later he assumed the same role for sears holdings updated   pm et t print font   chicago — sears holdings corp abruptly announced the departure of president and chief executive aylwin b lewis on monday leaving a management void at the top of the department store chain controlled by chairman edward s lampert as it tries a highstakes restructuring to reconnect with customers and reinvigorate slumping sales lewis was an executive at fastfood chain yum brands inc and had little retail experience when was handpicked by lampert in  to run kmart and later sears w bruce johnson was named as interim ceo while the company looks for a permanent successor monday’s announcement marked the latest chapter for the venerable retailer which has seen its competitors snatch away customers since lampert acquired kmart in  and sears roebuck and co in  at the time lampert — a masterful hedge fund investor who controls all major decisions made at sears holdings — promised to reinvigorate the faded retail icons and “transform them into a great company” nearly three years later lampert’s task has proven difficult if not downright impossible as customers continue to flee the company’s  tired stores in droves taking their wallets them “he certainly has his work cut out for him” said morningstar analyst kim picciola “even the total organizational change is an indicator that it was a much greater challenge than what they realized” for the first three quarters of the year sears’ profit has fallen more than  percent and earlier this month the company said it managed to post thirdquarter earnings of just  million — down  percent from last year advertise advertise advertise adding to investors’ frustrations was a warning that sears would likely post fourthquarter earnings well below wall street forecasts as eroding sales push its profit down as much as  percent the company said it expects to earn between  million and  million or  to  per share for the quarter ending saturday — far less than the  per share sought by analysts surveyed by thomson financial sears earned  million in the fourth quarter a year earlier the string of bad news prompted lampert whose esl investments inc owns  percent of sears’ common stock to announce a reorganization for the hoffman estatesbased company last week structuring the company into five types of units operating businesses support businesses brands online and real estate “the board has determined that now is the right time to put in place new leadership to take the company forward” lampert said monday in a statement but with its oncehefty war chest shrinking — cash and cash equivalents declined to  billion at the end of the third quarter down from  billion in february — investors aren’t sure if how much money lampert has to effectively fix sears in addition to leaving as ceo the yearold lewis will also resign from its board monday’s news did little to the company’s stock price which has fallen dramatically in the past year and standard  poor’s said the news would have no affect on sears’ credit outlook “since its formation in  sears holdings  has made progress in cutting costs but has not been able to show improvement in sales” standard  poor credit analyst gerald hirschberg said in statement “we continue to believe that topline growth will be very challenging despite the reorganization and change in management” retail consultant howard davidowitz who is chairman of davidowitz  associates said he questions how sears can embark on such an ambitious restoration plan without a fulltime chief executive at the helm “this is further chaos at sears” said davidowitz who has long been skeptical of lampert’s ability to successfully run a retailer “the company is in free fall with an interim ceo and things look more chaotic than they did before and the worst is yet to come” the company gave no timeline for finding a fulltime replacement for lewis who was one of the nation’s few black ceos of a fortune  company but industry experts said sears needs to tap an executive with retail experience if the company has any hopes of succeeding “it’s been an ongoing concern of ours that there hasn’t been anyone with merchandising experience at the helm” picciola said “and given the weak competitive position and struggles on the merchandising front we’re hopeful they’ll find someone with experience in this area” advertise advertise advertise johnson an executive vice president of supply chain and operations joined kmart in  after working at french retailer carrefour sa and consumer products maker colgatepalmolive co meanwhile monday sears disclosed in a regulatory filing that it may still be interested in acquiring trendy retrothemed retailer restoration hardware inc but for a lower price than its tentative pershare november bid sears which owns  percent of restoration hardware said it was evaluating the latest private equity offer for the corte madera califbased company “in order to understand the implications for any deal that sears holdings might contemplate” last week catterton partners lowered its bid for the homefurnishing store by more than  per share to  per

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could
