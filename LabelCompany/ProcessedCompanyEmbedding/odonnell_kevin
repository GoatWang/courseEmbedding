see    displaying items  of  page  of  geoff bybng  stars out of  september   geoff bybng i am only commenting on the buddhist section mr odonell does very slightly better than most christian authors in dealing with buddhism he also makes the usual mistakes he states that buddhism could almost accept an impersonal god and that dharma can mean life force these are nonsenses the word dharma can mean either way or truth or  a completely separate meaning phenonemon the concept of impersonal god is the same word as for soul atman the buddhist doctrine is anatman which clearly means no soul and no god and the buddha says this many times in the texts in fact an omnipotent god is just as impossible in a buddhist universe as in a scientific one the doctrine of emptiness does not mean underlying truth it means that there is no underlying truth and it very clearly says somy only other gripe with this quite good book is that it is not a general book it is specifically a christian take on world religions as the text frequently makes clear it is being marketed under false pretensions was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate displaying items  of  page  of  ask a
