you can also stimulate the mind with frescoed walls when one is the founder and president of an investment firm with some  million under management there’s no sense in playing the pauper when it comes to one’s personal real estate four bedrooms the more mattresses to hide money in the better wood paneled library what else would you panel the library with a frescoed dining room but of course the views of course are stunning naturally brian p friedman the founder and president of jefferies capital partners may want to freshen up the palatial coop he just picked up at  fifth avenue we hear he’s planning a gut renovation but we’re certain his modifications will be of the same standard if not the same taste as the stylings preferred by the coop’s former owner the late mexican cement tycoon lorenzo zambrano zambrano who built his family’s cement company cemex into an international behemoth spanning five continents before he died last may had an obvious love of marble porticoed vestibules columns ornate rugs elaborate elizabethan murals and tufted furniture none of which dissuaded mr friedman from paying the full  million ask for the apartment according to city records mr friedman has been the pad’s rumored buyer since february when pagesix reported that mr friedman was in the midst of negotiations—not a bad pickmeup in the wake of the sage kelly fiasco a scandal involving a banker at the firm whose soontobe exwife lobbed splashy accusations of drug use and sexual escapades at her spouse during divorce proceedings the previous owner did not skimp on wood paneling even given mr friedman’s remove from all accusations perhaps a somewhat dowdy apartment is not a bad way to go and while the decor may be a bit fussy for many tastes the thfloor apartment has much to recommend it according to the listing held by douglas elliman’s frances katzen and nicole krinick there is for example more than  feet of fifth avenue frontage overlooking the park a sunfilled library foot ceilings throughout a capacious kitchen and plenty of marbled baths ms katzen who declined to comment on the buyer nonetheless pronounced him “the perfect candidate for the building” and confirmed that a total overhaul was in the works nonetheless she said the apartment’s condition “was excellent” and “the viewline superb”   it is in other words an ideal master of the universe perch master of the universe though not any canines of cats the white glove coop has a no pets policy see also the john oliver property tax scam hbo comedian secretly buys manhattan mansion national
