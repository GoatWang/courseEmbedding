alphasign in  join nowgo»deep down inc under the radarsep  about deep down dpdw chase levay background there are some companies that due to being listed on the otc markets do not get the proper attention they deserve hopefully this article will bring to light a promising and relatively young company that i consider to have a bright future i should preface by saying this is my first article on any company for seeking alpha deep down inc otcqxdpdw is a provider of specialized services to the offshore energy industry to support deepwater and ultradeepwater exploration development and production of oil and gas and other maritime operations shortly after the companys incorporation in  the company went on to acquire electrowave usa inc mako technologies inc and flotation technologies inc all of which operated in the subseaoffshore energy industry it is worth noting that in december  all of the operating assets and liabilities of flotation were contributed to a joint venture entity named cuming flotation technologies llc cft in october  all of the common stock of cft its subsidiaries and other certain assets were acquired by af global corporation for  million deep down is currently entitled to  percent of future earnout proceeds from this sale today deep down inc is a fully serviceable company offering subsea solutions to the energy and offshore industries the company is lead and managed by its founders which all have extensive backgrounds in many aspects of the offshore industry more information on the companys leadership can be found in the management section of the companys website wwwdeepdowninccom financial beginning in the second quarter of  the company has experienced consistent growth in its bottom line however if you look at its fiscal year  results you will notice that the company reported a net loss of  million or  loss per diluted share for the first nine months of fy the company reported net income of  million or  per share the fiscal year loss for  was primarily due to an operating loss of  million and an impairment writeoff of assets of  million in the fourth quarter for the rov and topside equipment rental services division in august  management announced that they would consolidate its rov and topside rental equipment business with its subsea solutions services operations as part of a cost containment program the rov and equipment rental services division had experienced several preceding quarters of unprofitable performance that partially offset its bottom line with this division dissolved the company was able to reduce its workforce by  and reallocate capital and resources to its more profitable core business units as a result the company has seen both ebitda and net income for the first six months in  increase by  and  respectively over the same period in  ebitda and net income for the first six months of  were  million and  million respectively q additionally the company has seen demand for its products and services increase when observing its backlog which has grown from  million in q to  million in q an average increase of  quarteroverquarter financial highlights from the companys august  investor presentation more recently the company has made some positive announcements on june th deep down entered into a lease agreement for the lease of a  square feet warehouse including yard space and parking comprised of approximately seventeen  acres the company noted in its press release deep down will primarily use the facility for fabrication of longlead custom engineered products such as its steel flying leads and its nonhelical umbilicals which its customers are requesting for its deepwater and ultradeepwater needs deep down is expanding its operations and has entered into the lease because it has recently seen an increase in the physical size and complexity of its customers requirements and deep down believes it has outgrown its existing capacity at its current locations to accompany the capital requirements of additional machines equipment personnel production capacity and working capital the company announced on september th a private placement to sell an aggregate of  million shares of common stock at  per share for total gross proceeds of  million the price was calculated at a slight discount to the day moving average based on the date agreed upon in midaugust obviously as is the case with most equity offering the idea of shareholder dilution sends off a knee jerk reaction to shareholders and the stock price after the private placement announcement the stock took a  dip but quickly rebounded back above its  month average of  in the world of otc stocks the act of dilution is far too common however unlike some of these companies there are several reasons that refute the argument that deep down is an illiquid company or is in any type of financial trouble a an ebitda of  million cannot support a  million dollar backlog growing at a quarterly average of  an equity offering was necessary to keep up with growth and prevent a squeeze on its cash b the company has a current ratio of x and working capital of  million c its cost of debt is only  which speaks to the confidence its creditors have in them and d theyre showing a healthy profit margin of  regarding the private placement ron smith chief executive officer of deep down inc stated bringing in additional capital allows our company to significantly improve the manufacturing process on our core product line resulting in greater production capacity and increased gross margins the demand for our services and products has never been stronger we are bidding on more work and much bigger jobs and our backlog is at a record high we are now wellpositioned to address our multibillion dollar industry gene butler executive chairman and chief financial officer added this financing will significantly improve our overall capital structure and liquidity in our stock by increasing our institutional ownership to over  and places deep down in a better position to upgrade to a national stock exchange in the future valuation there are a few metrics that lead me to believe deep down is currently undervalued when measured against its peers the two companies i have chosen for comparison are in the subseaoffshore energy industry drilquip inc nysedrq and subsea  inc on the london stock exchange taking into consideration the newly issued shares dpdw should have total shares outstanding of approximately  million with a current pps at  this sets its market value at approximately  million when observing the ratio of market capitalization to backlog drilquip and subsea  are very close in comparison at x and x respectively applying its average market capbacklog ratio of x against dpdws backlog this would set its market capitalization at approximately  million or  per share even a conservatively low ratio of x would set the pps greater than  secondly a reasonable pe ratio cannot be assigned to the company since ttm eps is a negative figure however we can make a reasonable forecast on fy eps based on the companys forecast for fy revenues for the first six months of fy the company reported eps of  or a profit margin of  however this must be adjusted downward to approx  eps in order to appropriately account for the newly issued shares as i have inserted above the company makes a bottom line estimate on revenues of  million and a profit margin of  i will be conservative and assign its first six months profit margin of  to come up with net income of  million or  eps since drilquip and subsea s pe ratios are too far apart at x and x respectively i will apply the oilfield services and equipment industry average pe of x with this deep downs pps comes out to right at  a share these are very quick and simple valuations but i think it is reasonably ok to argue that dpdw is currently undervalued at only  per share and represents substantial upside potential industry forecast providing more evidence to this argument is the outlook for the subseaoffshore industry a report recently released by research and markets states that the subsea power grid system market will grow from an estimated  million in  to  million by  with a cagr of  through  the report goes on to state the deepwater subsea market is growing and will continue to grow significantly over the next five years with west africa north america and europe leading the way in total expenditures this has created a considerable market for power grids in subsea and power supply equipment and will continue to expand with the subsea market this trend makes the subsea power grid system industry lucrative for both gridcomponents manufacturers and service operators on account of heavy offshore infrastructure development and shifting focus towards renewable energy sources the power grid system market in subsea will experience a tremendous increase in demand in the years to come the report is consistent with some of the quarterly andor annual statements released by some of the largest players in the subseaoffshore industry such as drilquip and fmc technologies nasdaqfmi in drilquips second quarter q the company provides data for the number of offshore rig counts currently operating and the number of rigs currently under construction according to odspetrodata rigbase referenced in the q as of june   there were  rigs under contract in the us gulf of mexico  floating rigs and  jackup rigs of which  were actively drilling  floating rigs and  jackup rigs as of june   there were  rigs under contract in the us gulf of mexico  floating rigs and  jackup rigs all of the contracted rigs were actively drilling this represents an  increase yearoveryear for the number of rigs actively drilling furthermore drilquip and fmc both make note that the number of rigs semisubmersibles drillships and jackup rigs under construction impacts its revenues because in certain cases customers order some of the companys products during the construction of rigs as a result an increase in rig construction activity tends to favorably impact its backlog while a decrease in rig construction activity tends to negatively impact its backlog according to odspetrodata at the end of june  and  there were  and  offshore rigs respectively under construction an increase of  summary in summary there are several compelling indications that support the positive direction deep down inc is headed whether you look at the industry as a whole its growing backlog current expansion plans underway or its undervalued stock price there is value in any direction once the company uplists and begins to catch the eye of deeper pocket investors i strongly believe the stock price will reflect its true market value of the company i sat and watched flotek industries inc nyseftk go from a  stock to  over the past  years i wont make the same mistake with deep down inc i would encourage readers to

revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too
