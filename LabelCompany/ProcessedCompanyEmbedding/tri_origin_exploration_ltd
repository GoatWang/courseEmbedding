tri origin exploration ltd exploration process listed on the tmx venture exchange trading symbol toe business plan  objectives tri origins objective is to make a worldclass discovery that is developed into a producing mine which results in extraordinary return to shareholders the discovery strategy tri origin is a mineral exploration company focussed on making new discoveries in canadas north  we have a unique target generating approach specialized in identifying prospective terrain in nontraditional environments where previous explorers have not ventured and in recognizing ineffectually explored overburden covered extensions of welltrodden major mining districts earlystage exploration is conducted with the objective of making new discoveries that present opportunities with campscale potential that will have immediate attention to larger mining partners  as value is added to projects partnerships are entered into to fund more capitalintensive phases of exploration and development  return to shareholder investment is ultimately achieved through royalties equity ownership or participation in active mining operations business model a systematic scientific approach is used to identify new prospective geologic domains in underexplored metal endowed regions commodities of primary interest  gold copperzinc  deposit types  high value volcanicsedimentary  hosted pyritic lode gold deposits and auriferous base metal massive sulphides geographic focus  the precambrian greenstone belts and adjacent volcanosedimentary basins of the canadian shield within readily accessible corridors containing established infrastructure of roads rail lines and electrical power to provide lowcost accessibility and lowrisk for development targeting criteria  well defined targeting criteria are applied to identify and acquire prospective but overlooked or misidentified properties large enough to envelope potential campscale discoveries and provide a pipeline of projects which will be of interest to select midtier mining companies and investors company expertise and experience is melded with modern exploration techniques to generate and screen earlystage targets value is added to properties through initial funding by tri origin followed by establishing partnerships with larger mining firms or private investment groups for more capital intensive phases of work shareholder value is created through a combination of high value discoveries advancing properties to development through funding agreements with industry partners and ultimately by investment return through equity participation in producing mines or net smelter return royalties on production the exploration process the process required to make an economicallyviable discovery requires an expensive and risky investment with longodds of being successful and it takes time  tri origin understands the risk involved in the business and has adopted a consistent strategy that differs from the majority of its peers tri origins exploration programs begin with its people and are based on a sound understanding of geological science and the formation of ore deposits  this expertise is combined with the use of innovative and uptodate geophysical and geochemical technologies to identify orehosting environments in covered and often overlooked terrain  detailed exploration is conducted systematically at selected areas to delineate targets for drill testing  drilling is the litmus test for discovery  continual drill testing and refinement of the targeting model is an ongoing process but if done with rigor results in the discovery of new mineral deposits and sees them developed into profitable mining operations   science and our team geological field investigation geophysical and geochemical surveying drilling and discovery development and mining view gallery science and our team gold and other metals didn’t just deposit themselves randomly throughout the canadian shield only specific geologic settings can host major ore deposits and these settings are constrained by the types of rocks that are present their depositional environment how much heat and pressure these rocks have experienced what kind of fluids and how much fluid has passed through the rocks and whether they have been sheared faulted stressed or otherwise deformed   tri origin’s geologists are welltrained in the science of geology and ore deposits the exploration cycle begins with scouring through and compiling available research and databases including reports publications and maps on the geology and mineralization of the canadian shield looking for clues to overlooked and hidden mineralization a general interest in the science of ore deposits keeps our geologists up to date with the latest research and reports from government university and industry sources to keep skills sharp in the field and in the lab smart exploration starts with strong background knowledge of an area before site visits are initially conducted view gallery geological field investigation once tri origin has identified a prospective area for mineral exploration the company acquires the rights to explore in the form of claims over the land claims come in a variety of types and have specific ownership requirements depending on jurisdiction and government regulations in much of northern canada they may be acquired through staking of uninhabited crown land or by agreement with current claim holders  preliminary exploration conducted by company geologists consists of a mix of prospecting geological mapping geophysical and geochemical surveying prospecting involves traversing the claims by foot and looking for signs of mineralization andor alteration in exposed rock outcrops or boulders samples are collected and sent to specialized laboratories for detailed analyses of their concentrations of gold silver copper lead and zinc as well as other elements and minerals that may indicate their proximity to significant concentrations of metals  geological mapping provides the detailed information required to reconstruct the depositional environment of the ancient rocks that underlie the property and identify the signs of ore forming events that have effected these rocks geological mapping provides the detailed information required to reconstruct the depositional environment of the ancient rocks that underlie the property and identify the signs of ore forming events that have effected these rocks view gallery geophysical and geochemical surveying geophysical surveying involves specialized contractors who perform surveys that measure physical properties of rock both directly where rock is outcropping and remotely in overburden covered areas the most common survey types include spectral imaging electromagnetic magnetic gravity seismic and variations and combinations of these surveys in most areas of canada’s north regional airborne electromagnetic and magnetic surveys are initially flown over a property in addition to geophysics geochemical surveying is a specialized exploration technique conducted by the company’s geological technologists the slow decay of bedrock through the weathering process contributes trace amounts of metals and other pathfinder elements to groundwater these elements are transported and subsequently concentrated in overburden vegetation and soils regional soil till and water sampling studies conducted by the government in tri origin’s project areas provide background data for infill sampling conducted by tri origin at both district and very detailed scales  accredited geochemical laboratories are used by the company to analyse these samples for gold and a suite of trace metals at levels in the low parts per billion range view gallery drilling and discovery drill target selection commences with data integration and assuring its quality when all data has been compiled and verified tri origin’s geologists portray the information on a variety of  and  dimensional maps at both regional and very detailed scales the large variety of geological geochemical and geophysical data sets are overlain and integrated to allow interpretation of propertyscale geological setting and the various geophysical and geochemical anomalies that occur in potentially orehosting environments these anomalies are ranked and prioritized for drill testing  a discovery is made when the concentration of metals in a drill intersection is of potentially economic grade and of potentially mineable thickness and continuity of the mineralization is evident in three dimensions discovery does not imply the existence of a mineable deposit further stepout and infill drilling and detailed studies are required to more accurately determine the size of the deposit establish a resource and most importantly establish its economic viability view gallery development and mining delineation of a resource is the beginning step in the development of an orebody feasibility studies addressing all aspects of the design capital requirements construction metallurgy and processing of products operations financial returns and rehabilitation are completed if predicted economic returns are positive a resource can be classified as a reserve if capital can be raised permits obtained and other hurdles met mine development can commence development is capital intensive and there is a long leadtime before a mining operation commences and capital can be paid back and profits are generated  mining involves the extraction of the ore from the deposit and the metallurgical treatment of the ore to separate out valuable metals and produce metal concentrates which are saleable products tri origin’s expertise is not in this area however our objective is to benefit from the mining of our discoveries by sharing profits that result from retaining a direct equity interest in a mining operation or by receiving a percentage of the value of metals produced through net smelter return royalties tri origin is not a development or a mining company our strategy is to partner with well capitalized companies to participate in the financial returns that result from discovery tri origin’s business is discovery tri origin exploration powered by innovasium to top swot analysis reports  company profiles sales and support     uk

information the red lake extension property “rlx” is located in northwestern ontario  km southeast of the town of red lake and approximately  km northwest of thunder bay the property is accessible by truck from red lake and is crossed by a number of wheel drive and allterrain vehicle tracks and trails the southern and eastern portions of the red lake greenstone belt have been the major productive centres in the district and consist of three major volcanic assemblages the balmer woman and confederation the balmer assemblage hosts all of the major gold deposits in the red lake district it consists of mafic tholeiitic to komatiitic flows sills and subvolcanic intrusions with lesser iron formation rhyolitic flows and associated pyroclastic and clastic sedimentary rocks the rlx property is underlain by the extension of the cochenourgullrock lake deformation zone the mine trend structure which has strongly deformed the main orebody at the red lake mine and is believed to be responsible for the formation of spectacular shoots of highgrade ore this structure has also offset the eastern portion of the red lake greenstone belt to the southeast and resulted in a  kilometre long segment of volcanic and sedimentary rocks of the balmer assemblage reoccurring within the rlx property it is this  kilometre long sequence of covered and previously unexplored balmer rock that offers the potential for new discovery tri origin’s work and interpretations have resulted in outlining a new and prospective districtscale exploration trend geotechnical work completed and evaluated by tri origin includes results from a  line kilometre “vtem” airborne magnetic and electromagnetic survey  km of ground induced polarization geophysical surveying and approximately  humus and  mineral soil geochemical analyses a total of  diamond drill holes investigating targets at different parts of the property have been completed by  most of these holes were successful in intersecting their targets a large number of the drill holes intercepted volcanic rocks that contained significant alteration and sulphide mineralization which are corealated with the balmer volcanic assemblage which

that a large portion of the canadian shield west of the detour mine area is underlain predominately by granitic rocks and gneisses this area is entirely covered by glacial overburden so this earlier belief was not established through factual data but came about due to lack of bedrock mapping by comparison exploration activity for over  kilometres east of the detour mine area into québec has uncovered several important new gold and base metal discoveries geophysical signatures from regional airborne magnetic surveys flown by the ontario government exhibit similarities between the detour west property and the detour mine area no other surveying has been conducted and tri origin believes that the application of modern exploration technologies will result in rapid delineation of

alliance the property consists of over  claim units comprising  staked claims which extend along a selected geological terrain of almost  kilometres in length and cover an area of over  square kilometers the south abitibi project targets a large expanse of prospective archeanage rock of the southern abitibi which is covered by proterozoicage sedimentary rocks throughout the cobalttemagami region these cover rocks precluded historic prospecting along this portion of the abitibi and limited the effectiveness of earlier geophysical equipment which had minimal depth penetration ability furthermore much of this terrain was excluded from exploration during the time period between  and  due to land cautions and exploration moratoriums early stage prospecting and geologic mapping has been conducted by tri origin to verify the prospectivity of covered extensions of mapped archean rocks which border the targeted area a vtemplus airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey over a large and detailed survey grid totaling approximately  kilometres of flight lines was commissioned to map the covered archean rocks and identify deep electromagnetic conductors that could represent

north to south mafic volcanic rocks iron formation and chemical sedimentary rocks intermediate and felsic volcanic rocks and sedimentary rocks tri origin’s recent programs have focused on detecting extensions to known pyritic gold zones reminiscent of the gold deposits of the bousquetlaronde district in quebec which are hosted by altered intermediate and felsic volcanic units a number of other gold occurrences are known on the property and are associated with iron formation these are of a type more typical to the past producing gold mines at pickle lake and also warrant followup surveying and drilling compilation of previous work by tri origin has resulted in a substantial geotechnical database comprising over  diamond drill holes geochemical analyses of over  humus and mineral soil samples results from airborne and ground magnetic and electromagnetic surveys as well as data from a substantial amount of ground induced polarization surveying modern high resolution heliborne electromagnetic and magnetic data were acquired by tri origin in  and tri origin collected and analysed over  humus samples and more than  mineral soil samples during its first phase of work detailed grid work including induced polarization geophysical surveying was completed at the eastcentral part of the property during the winter of  and a diamond drill program of  holes was completed in late  this work confirmed that goldbearing rock units continue from gold occurrences on adjacent claims onto the sky lake property during the summer of  tri origin conducted a program of geologic mapping geochemical mineral soil and humus sampling and ground induced polarization surveying geochemical sampling delineated areas of anomalous gold and silver in soil and humus which remain to be explained geologic mapping demonstrated that rock units which host gold on adjacent claims extend to the northwest onto the sky lake claims and ip surveying was successful in identifying chargeability anomalies that require drill testing imgprojectsnorthabitibinorthabitibibottomjpg north abitibi north abitibi is a gold exploration project located within the burntbush greenstone belt at the northcentral part of the abitibi subprovince of the canadian shield gold has been intersected in diamond drill holes over a  kilometre long highlyprospective trend and detailed drilling has outlined two zones which have continuity in three dimensions the northcentral part of the abitibi subprovince hosts the mattagami selbaie joutel and casa berardi mining camps the north abitibi claims cover a cluster of significant gold occurrences approximately  kilometres west of and along trend from the casa berardi mine operated by hecla mining corp diamond drilling conducted by tri origin and previous explorers demonstrates the opportunity for discovery of a multimillion ounce highgrade gold deposit of the pyritic lode gold type the secondary target is a large tonnage lowgrade disseminated deposit associated with extensive alteration and deformation zones imgprojectsnorthabitibinorthabitibibottomjpg north abitibi  project status the property is comprised of  unpatented contiguous claims covering  square kilometres  hectares vista gold corporation transferred interest in  claims to tri origin during  subject to certain exploration commitments and a backin right held by vista gold tri origin also holds interest in  claims acquired from north american exploration inc which are subject to the vista agreement the majority of exploration in the burntbush greenstone belt was conducted by several major companies during the ’s following discovery of the casa berardi gold deposit and only limited and sporadic campaigns have been conducted since then the large majority of the burntbush area is overburden covered and this has limited the effectiveness of previous exploration campaigns tri origin has compiled and interpreted a large geophysical and diamond drilling database from this previous work including assay data from over  drill holes spread across the length of the property and historical gold intercepts indicate targets for future diamond drilling the majority of these holes were completed by newmont cogema canada and tri origin twentyone  of these holes reported at least one sample of greater than  grams per tonne of gold across one meter sample intervals these and other goldbearing marker units which extend across the property provide strong evidence for the occurrence of significant as yet undiscovered deposits of gold during earlier field seasons tri origin has completed surface geophysical and geochemical sampling and drilled over  exploratory diamond drill holes the spade lake and road gold zones have been partially delineated and are at a stage of exploration where detailed diamond drill programs and additional excavating at the road gold zone are required to define the extent of these gold zones in three dimensions other gold occurrences have been identified by drilling elsewhere on the property and detailed geophysical surveying and drilling is warranted to advance these discoveries imgprojectsnorthabitibinorthabitibibottomjpg north abitibi technical information the north abitibi claims are located in northeastern ontario  km west of the ontarioquebec border and approximately  km northeast and north of timmins and kirkland lake ontario respectively access to the property is by truck a number of  wheel drive and allterrain vehicle tracks and trails cross the property providing good access for exploration the north abitibi property is located within the eastwest trending burntbush greenstone belt a northwestern extension of the abitibi subprovince the burntbush belt extends for over  km eastward into quebec as the harricanaturgeon greenstone belt which hosts the mattagami selbaie joutel and casa berardi mining camps the burntbush greenstone belt consists of four distinct eastwest trending assemblages the blakelock assemblage underlies the north abitibi property and is the westward equivalent of volcanic and sedimentary domains which occur at the casa berardi mine which are composed of basaltic to komatiitic volcanic rocks and capped by pelagic sedimentary rocks and oxide facies iron formation the geology of the north abitibi property has largely been compiled from drill core logs trench mapping and geophysical interpretation since bedrock outcrops are rare the property is underlain by a mixed assemblage of eastwest trending northdipping felsic intermediate and mafic volcanic pyroclastic and volcaniclastic rocks with intercalated sedimentary units of greywacke argillite and oxide facies iron formation these units are intruded by a coarsegrained to porphyritic felsic sills known as the spade lake porphyry gold mineralization is hosted by stratabound pyritic sericitic schists up to  metres thick within magnetitebearing volcaniclastic rocks at the spade lake zone and as stratabound veins of quartz ± carbonate ± feldspar ± pyrite ± rare tourmaline at the contact between magnetiterich dacitic pyroclastic rocks and ironcarbonate rich mafic volcanic rocks at the road gold zone tri origin is targeting alongstrike and downdip extensions of both the spade lake and road gold zones spade lake has returned gold values from drilling of up to  grams per tonne across  metres and  grams per tonne across  metres the road gold zone has returned gold values of  grams per tonne across  metres including  grams per tonne across  metre and  grams per tonne across  metres trenching completed by tri origin at the road gold zone exposed the zone at surface and highgrade assays of up to  grams of gold and  grams of silver per tonne were returned from grab samples this work extended the known limits of gold mineralization in the area to over  metres in length the north abitibi property hosts a number of other gold occurrences which require additional geophysical surveying and drilling to evaluate their economic potential imgprojectsnorthabitibinorthabitibibottomjpg south abitibi the south abitibi project is an alliance between tri origin and sumac mines ltd a subsidiary of sumitomo metal mining co ltd to explore for gold and base metals along the southern margin of the abitibi greenstone belt of ontario tri origin is the operator of the project and sumac is funding property acquisition and early stage exploration activities a large land position has been acquired in the cobalttemagami region of eastcentral ontario the property overlies four target areas selected by tri origin that encompass covered and previously unexplored segments of the abitibi greenstone belt these covered areas are regional extensions of known metalliferous districts that have yet to be explored using modern deeppenetrating geophysical techniques the alliance will focus its search on highgrade and highvalue gold and goldrich polymetallic sulphide deposits imgprojectsnorthabitibinorthabitibibottomjpg south abitibi  project status tri origin entered into a preliminary joint venture agreement with sumac mines ltd a subsidiary of sumitomo metal mining co

tri origin interest sumac is funding the initial phase of work at the alliance properties to a maximum total expenditure of c million if results warrant following the initial work the two companies will enter into specific joint venture agreements to conduct advanced exploration and project development at successful properties on a prorata funded basis tri origin has staked a large property holding in the cobalttemagami area along the south margin of the abitibi greenstone belt on behalf of the sumac alliance the property consists of over  claim units comprising  staked claims which extend along a selected geological terrain of almost  kilometres in length and cover an area of over  square kilometers the south abitibi project targets a large expanse of prospective archeanage rock of the southern abitibi which is covered by proterozoicage sedimentary rocks throughout the cobalttemagami region these cover rocks precluded historic prospecting along this portion of the abitibi and limited the effectiveness of earlier geophysical equipment which had minimal depth penetration ability furthermore much of this terrain was excluded from exploration during the time period between  and  due to land cautions and exploration moratoriums early stage prospecting and geologic mapping has been conducted by tri origin to verify the prospectivity of covered extensions of mapped archean rocks which border the targeted area a vtemplus airborne electromagnetic and magnetic survey over a large and detailed survey grid totaling approximately  kilometres of flight lines was commissioned to map the covered archean rocks and identify deep electromagnetic conductors that could represent buried ore deposits interpretation of survey results to identify drill targets will continue through the winter of  field investigations of anomalous target areas will be conducted as weather permits imgprojectsnorthabitibinorthabitibibottomjpg south abitibi technical information the south abitibi project area lies  km northeast of sudbury ontario between the towns of temagami and temiskaming shores and west of the town of cobalt the area is accessible by highway  north from north bay and numerous roads trails lakes and rail lines make the area highly accessible by truck atv and boat the towns of temagami and cobalt have a long history of exploration and mining dating back to the turn of the th century the sherman mine in temagami produced iron ore from  to  and the kanichee mine produced copper nickel and pges sporadically between  and  a number of small mines also produced gold silver copper zinc pyrite and cobalt throughout the twentieth century north of temagami the northland pyrite mine produced sulphur from massive pyrite lenses in the archean between  and  the town of cobalt was founded during the silver rush of  and the cobalt area was one of the most prolific silver and cobalt mining districts in canada until the s with dozens of mines both big and small having been worked recently released government data indicates that archean rocks of the cobalttemagami region are of similar age and composition to those hosting the major gold and base metal deposits of the bousquetla ronde and noranda mining districts to the northeast in quebec the south abitibi property is interpreted to host the extensions of these prospective archeanage volcanic rocks in the temagamicobalt area most of these archean rocks are covered by a sequence of younger proterozoicage sedimentary rocks of variable and largely unknown thickness detailed compilation and review of the substantial geotechnical database of geological and geophysical work published by government geologic surveys and private companies in the area has resulted in selection of four target areas that are prospective for new deposits and districts of gold and gold rich polymetallic deposits tri origin’s work indicates that the thickness of cover rocks in these four target areas is not prohibitive to
