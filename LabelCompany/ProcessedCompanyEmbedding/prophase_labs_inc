wonder or about to explodejun  about prophase labs prph gains on gains longshort equity microcap smallcap nanocapsummarycoldeeze is fairly well establishedprospects for utilizing brand extension are mixedestablished channels could help new productsthe company is not currently undervalued as management suggestsprophase labs inc nasdaqprph is a homeopathic health care company known primarily for its coldeeze line of products most popular in lozenge form coldeeze uses a formulation of zinc that is clinically proven to reduce the duration of the common cold the market for supplements meant to shorten andor prevent sickness during the winter months is quite large with industry leaders airborne and emergenc each being snapped up in acquisitions in recent years the former went to schiff nutrition for  million and the latter to pfizer nysepfe for an undisclosed but certainly even larger amount interestingly despite them dwarfing prophases  million in annual revenue and  million market cap neither of these larger companies are capable of making the types of claims about their products that prophase can make of coldeeze airbornes website homepage mentions supporting immunity but it relates supplements within the product and not the product itself deeper in the site it is explained that research has confirmed that the key ingredients in airborne® support immune health and those studies have appeared in a number of peer reviewed journals emergenc similarly only discusses ingredients and does so in even more vague terms this contrasts with coldeeze which has a clinical trials tab on its landing page that leads to the following if prophases coldeeze has the best science does this mean the product will eventually take over the category more on that later whats important to understand at this point is that it has an established product generating real sales one major problem with the cold and flu fighting industry is that it is both seasonal and epidemiologically dependent fixed costs persist in the warmer months even when product shipments are down and sales can decline due to low incidence of viruses which are beyond company control to combat these issues the company has decided to begin branching out according to the latest k filing prophase has three products in the pipeline legendz xl for sexual health triple edge xl a daily energy booster plus testosterone support and super prostaflow plus for prostate and urinary health the first of these three tk supplements products legendz xl is scheduled for launch in the first half of fiscal  currently legendz xl is available through the free trial plus automatically renewing subscription model revenue is minimal at this point however as the sales are simply a way for prophase to test several different television marketing strategies to get a sense of the direction it is leaning you can check out the supplements youtube channel it appears humor and a character named average joe are looks to be included in any campaign but other decisions remain chief among these is whether or not prophase will be leveraging the coldeeze name as only one of the three ads take advantage of the brand it is obvious that legendz xl stands to benefit from the association few product reviews are currently available but one which i did find kept harping on one way in which legendz xl was separating itself their business model closely mirrors these other supplements but since it comes from a fairly reputable company with an established business reputation it might be an exception to the rule as we mentioned in the previous section because legendz xl comes from an established company they might not present the same level of risk legendz xl wants to be associated with coldeeze but does the relationship work both ways it appears at this point it does not management explained in a lengthy conference call with regards to using the coldeeze brand name and associating that with legendz and research weve done in the past that was a mix bag at best undoubtedly the damage that could be done to the clinically vetted family friendly coldeeze by infomercial penis pills is viewed as too great a risk this is not to say that legendz xl itself is snake oil in fact it is following the same path to validation as coldeeze the products marketing materials reference clinical trials that are again related to the product as a whole ceo ted karkus  a major owner of the company  points out unlike competitors we conduct clinical studies on the whole product we dont simply add ingredients that others have provided some clinical studies just on their one ingredient which was then put into the product our product works really well still perception matters the only way legendz xl will succeed is by standing out and a nonprescription tablet that increases blood flow is going to have to fight to differentiate itself for example that same review erroneously states based on our experience reviewing these types of supplements the website is referencing some of legendz xls ingredients  specifically the larginine we discussed aboveand not the supplement itself for this reason my personal opinion is that prophase should take the risk and create the coldeeze association in the mind of consumers despite a reluctance to utilize coldeeze in media the existing product still is a major resource for legendz xl once testing determines the best marketing strategy and pricing prophase intends to move the product into retail this is a step that would be difficult for a flybynight sexual health company but with coldeeze in thousands of locations and a distribution network in place the task becomes substantially easier additionally initial indications are that convenience stores are very interested in the product one reason theyre interested in the product is because we make a clinically shown claim if legendz xl were to succeed for prophase then the company would really take off both of the other named products that are in the works serve a similar market so there would be no more dilemma about how to leverage the existing brand from the makers of legendz xl would be plastered all over every box of triple edge xl and super prostaflow plus a scenario involving those other products is just a fantasy of management at this point though an investor in the prophase of today has two questions to consider will legendz xls clinical trials distribution and maybe coldeeze association be able to differentiate it and how strong is coldeeze really the answer to the first is up for debate as i have laid out the potential is there however it is this second question that would keep me away from shares of prophase despite having the best science coldeeze sales are sputtering gross profit for the company once rising nicely has declined each of the last two years maybe all the people for whom clinical trials are a differentiator are going to their doctors and getting fda approved treatments year net sales gross profit                from  to  the decline was attributed to lost shelf space for the product category as a whole and higher coupon usage for coldeeze for the  to  slippage the company is blaming an unusually mild cold and flu season in fact it is spinning its results as a positive stating that because incidence of upper respiratory tract infection was down double digits and sales were down less than that then effectively sales rose there are two problems with that logic first even if the prior years gross profit was applied to  the company would still have lost money it needs to get back to  levels to turn a profit additionally  marked the introduction of coldeeze liquids into the market place distribution wasnt as wide as for lozenges but it certainly added to the top line this means it is entirely possible that even the pro forma growth in sales described by prophase is inaccurate independent of the new product sales of existing products may very well have fallen more than the decline in infection would indicate google trends data bears this out as coldeeze appears to be caught in a channel or even modestly declining financially this puts prophase in a tough spot once it has calibrated legendz xls pricing and settled on a marketing strategy it will need money to advertise potentially a good deal of it yet its only sitting on a few million in cash ceo karkus very directly answered the query so basically youre not going to be profitable this year and youre going to have negative cash flow by stating thats probably a fair statement in other words the balance sheet will get worse before it gets better and dilution is almost assuredly coming the company can control for when but for a business with a small market cap like prophase its going to likely be significant karkus discussed this stating i am trying really hard not to issue millions and millions of shares of stock and raise  million and then burn through it i am really trying to do this as conservatively as possible at the same time a couple of million dollars of dilution to potentially build a new brand that could be worth  million or tens of millions dollars whats worse is the investors might come demanding a discount why besides having all the leverage karkus seemed to make the unwitting argument that his company is at best properly valued a caller to the companys call asked karkuss opinion on the value of the coldeeze brand and he responded with a small and shrinking brand maybe you get between half and onetimes revenue if its a stable brand it depends on the size of the brand it depends on the gross profit margins it can go for anywhere from one to four times revenues the coldeeze brand is certainly worth more than one times revenue and to put that in perspective our stock right now probably values our brands at about one times revenues but we also own two properties we own a stateoftheart manufacturing facility which i really didnt even touch on we have one of the best manufacturing facilities in the country for manufacturing lozenges and hard candy so we have a valuable manufacturing facility we own two properties coldeeze has strong gross profit margins at around  but to say it is growing or even that it is stable is suspect the numbers both financial and via google trends dont lie therefore valuing it at one times revenue meaning the high end for shrinking properties or the low end for stable ones seems fair also whatever value is added by the facilities is likely negated by legendz xl  a venture that may prove to push the company to the next level eventually but for now is simply a way to accelerate cash burn furthermore a fair price for the prophase can be assessed historically in  a company made a bid to acquire prophase for first  and later  per share that was in the midst of the companys best year so it would be hard for any potential acquirer to justify offering more without seeing the new product line take off or coldeeze suddenly gain market share i like coldeeze the product but at this point i am not the biggest fan of prophase the company for my interest to be piqued shares would have to be trading near their  week lows of around a dollar the company would need to risk coldeeze to support legendz xl or i would at least have to see legendz xl popping up in retail stores therefore signaling that the test phase of marketing was complete even then id rather invest in a post dilution environment karkus insists that the company is undervalued coldeeze is not in decline and legendz xl will succeed over the course of the next year it will be his job to prove it but for now his claims come with the same type of asterisk that accompanies so many homeopathic remedies let
