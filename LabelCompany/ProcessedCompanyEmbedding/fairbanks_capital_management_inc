management inc home about us our mission executive profiles investment strategy reliable growth power of compounding principles of company selection minimizing tax exposure accessibility and accountability fixed income contact us minimizing tax exposure home  investment strategy  minimizing tax exposure minimizing tax exposure fairbanks capital management inc utilizes a low turnover investment style that minimizes the taxation of gains in taxable accounts avoiding high turnover for the taxable investor located in california or a state with a similar tax regime taxation can reduce returns by   take the example of an actively managed equity mutual fund that earns a  return in a particular year  if the fund has the high level of turnover common among today’s mutual funds much of this return will be taxable  if half of the realized gains are shortterm the combined federal and state tax penalty to the fund’s return could exceed   thus the rate of return to its investor is reduced in reality to about  after tax  as an investor who is subject to taxation the rate of return which one actually keeps is what really counts required distributions a painful lesson some mutual fund investors have learned is that mutual funds must distribute any net realized gains whether the fund made or lost money for the year  yes a fund that loses money for the year may still sock its investors with a tax bill at fcmi we are long term investors  our major positions are held for years  many positions we started building for our more seasoned clients have never been sold allowing real cases where our basis is in the low single digits on stocks now selling over  per share because of our consistent longterm strategy the returns our investors earn are exposed to minimal taxation
