privacy policy petitioning ceo microsoft satya nadelladecision makerssatya nadellaceo microsoftmicrosoft needs to allow windows  users to opt out of telemetry data collectionjerry berg duvall wajerry bergduvall wa99supportersunder the leadership of new ceo satya nadella microsoft has changed their company policies to violate the trust of their customers by collecting personally identifiable data without our knowledge or consent in the windows  consumer version of their operating system microsoft has made some progress in the latest windows  creators update to disclose some the information they are gathering but offer no mechanism to disable the personal data gathering entirely on the consumer based versions of their windows  operating system the enterprise versions of their software have off setting to prevent windows  from sending any personal data to microsoft from machines running that variant however they have not extended this option to the consumer versions of windows  that we all run on our desktops and laptop computers microsoft has disclosed some of the information they gather in the two available modes called basic and full however the basic setting which is the lowest level of personal data gathered still collects thousands of fields many of which people are uncomfortable sharing microsoft has also gone on record stating that the data they collect is not personally identifiable because they dont have access to the databases that contain details about the end user but they fail to mention that everything is logged under the windows live account the person is using on the system along with their ip address which can be traced back to the system and confirmed with the mac address of the networking hardware which is also sent to them as a part of the data that is gathered not to mention they collect text fields that could contain your name address phone  credit card information etc this means that microsoft has the capaibility to link all the data collected from your system in the background  back to you personally if they chose to or they are compelled to by a rd party this petition is to encourage microsoft to offer the same off option for data collection in all versions of the windows  operating system and not just the enterprise version of the software microsoft has no right to consume our bandwidth to send our personal data to their databases for their own personal gain microsoft hides behind the message that this data is all collected to make the product better for us and it should not concern us in the slightest if you do your research on the data actually gathered you will see that much of it has absolutely no use in debugging or making software better but rather would have a purpose for market research and targeted advertisement  lets all sign this petition and encourage microsoft to do the right thing by providing an off option for data collection in every version of the windows  operating system and not just the enterprise version that is used by businesses i would also like to note the reason that an off option exists in the enterprise version of the product is because hospitals and other instutitions would be violating their policies and laws by allowing microsoft to collect potentially private and sensitive data from those machines now ask yourself why dont i have this same right to protect my information bandwidth identity and intellectual property on my own machine please watch my full video on this topic and please share it with as many people as you can and lets hold microsoft accountable and get them to do the right thing the ceo satya nadella of microsoft will personally receive this petition as more signatures are gathered and ive also received some interest from some local and international news outlets to cover this story if we get enough exposurelink to videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwpfbaqicujothis petition will be delivered toceo microsoftsatya nadellaread the letterletter toceo microsoft satya nadellamicrosoft needs to add an off option to stop collecting telemetry from machines that request it currently only the enterprise sku of the windows  operating system supports this option and all consumer level versions still must at least select a basic option which sends 9 of the overall collected data to microsoft which is unacceptable the end users should be allowed to lock down their machine from sending data that could be sensitive to microsoft doctors lawyers and other professionals that have data on their computer that cannot be seen by outside sources are at risk because of microsofts data collection policies this has to change and it needs to change quickly please listen to this petition and the thousands of people that dont want microsoft spying on them and add this option to the consumer skus and make the option highly visible and explained during the installation of the creators update or any future updateokmicrosoft

into the realm of graphic design and soon discovered the excitement and challenge of interactive design in the form of cdrom and early web site development after completing a master of fine art in visual communication he moved to san francisco in san francisco he was a founding member of the team and the creative director that started golf media inc which was a design firm that created cdrom
