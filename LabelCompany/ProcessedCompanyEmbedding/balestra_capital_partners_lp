capital if government programs were cancelled the economy would collapse back into severe recession while hardly an opinion that would be questioned around these parts it is still good to see that even some of the smart money shares our views about the schrodinger economy alive and dead at the same time depending if the bls or anyone else is observing it and we are not totally insane visavis onetime non recurring government bailouts which just incidentally have become perpetual and endless the federal government has manfully stepped up to fill the gap left by consumers who have been forced to retrench and who are trying to repair their finances by paying down debt and increasing their savings  so the next question has to be  is this recovery selfsustaining or is the economy still on life support held together by periodic massive liquidity injections and ultra low interest rates and accompanied by a dangerous if not reckless expansion of government debt  we think that if government programs were canceled the economy would collapse back into severe recession and here balestras chris gorgone explains quite astutely why anyone betting on a decoupling or perpetual usd reserve status may want to reconsider the us is no longer in complete control of its own destiny  we exist now in a world of increasing correlation in the arenas of economics finance trade politics etc  what happens in europe china the middle east etc will have major impacts on american economic political and social outcomes  the world is changing  rapidly  the old rules that so many investors rely upon may no longer apply the way they did during the great growth years after world war ii alas this too is spot on mar    pm  sac up  ytd paulson heart boehner and other hedge fund observations

john paulson is now officially the biggest fan of john boehner read on jul    am  balestra capital we view gold as potentially the best currency we view gold as potentially the best currency an ongoing portfolio theme based on the probability that central bankers in the us europe and japan will continue their efforts to stimulate their economies with excessive monetary easing printing money while ignoring for the time being the dangerous fiscal ramifications while deflation is the current problem these policies increase the risk of a sudden turn to inflation without the return of significant global growth it is possible that we get the worst outcome in the form of stagflation for example oil and other commodity producers may start to demand higher prices in debasing currencies even though unemployment remains high and wages are stagnant or falling our analysis of commodities markets indicates that this effect has already begun james melcher balestra capital may    pm  risk aversion taking hold after months of injected liquidity chasing risk assets through a pervasive usdfunded carry trade the liquidity has dried credit markets have begun to diverge from equities cash flow problems in the real economy have resurfaced the dollar has started a deleveragingbased short squeeze rally and risk aversion is becoming the name of the game again dec    pm  deep thoughts from james melcher of balestra capital  must read we are no longer in a golden age we are in trouble the correction of economic and social distortions that have built up over the past twenty years is underway it is creating serious ongoing economic and social problems and despite the reassurances of central bankers and investment pundits there is no easy way to deal with it the fed’s standard remedy for treating recessions by lowering interest rates and boosting liquidity has been seriously abused since  the normal clearing function of recessions was aborted by an overreactive monetary intervention in every case while fiscal irresponsibility at all levels of government mounted unimpeded and regulators were curtailed reviled or fired these policies are not a template for remediation as we wrote in a recent balestra bulletin for policymakers to expect the most overborrowed and overspent consumers in the world to borrow and spend more in order to carry us out of this recession is foolishness so we suggest that the experts change their playbook and look for guidance at the us from the late s through the s or more recently japan’s ongoing tortuous financial struggle which has its roots in the excesses of the s  balestra capital dec    pm  user login username  password  create new account request new password to prevent automated spam submissions leave this field empty zero
