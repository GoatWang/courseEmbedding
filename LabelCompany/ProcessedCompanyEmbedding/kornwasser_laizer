read the latest ratings or rate your own job here is laizer kornwasser the mastermind behind philidor and the phantom pharmacies discussion in valeant pharmaceuticals started by anonymous nov   at  pm tags add tags page  of   anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest he was the former senior executive vp of medco health solutions reporting directly to the ceo david snow he designed and ran their entire mailorder  specialty pharma business medco was found to have committed fraud in several lawsuits and admitted itself including rx fraud changing diagnoses to obtain rxs faking doctor approvals medicare fraud channel stuffing etc the works its all public information then expressscripts buys medco and he is fired then he reappears at valeant reporting directly to ceo pearson until the brand new and mysterious title company group chairman his compensation is tied directly to skyrocketing sales if sales grew by over  a year he was to get nearly  shares a year thats like myear he was making insane from the day he started to when he mysteriously disappeared when questions started being asked about valeants accounting and sales the share price rocketed from  to  that made pearson a billionaire and laizer made tens of millions perhaps a hundred million plus dollars o wow whats even more strange is he was hired january nd  which was the exact date philidor was first incorporated hrm what do you guys think looks like andrew lefts style of writing too pretty damning stuff pdfsr dot compdfthemissingpiece did laizer drive ferraris and the like at philidor thats one rich year old exec   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest wow this sure sounds familiar httpwwwfalseclaimsactcomcasemedcohealthsolutionsfinalmillionsettlement improper practices alleged in the complaints and covered in the settlement agreement include cancelling destroying or reentering prescriptions into its prescription database system to report a later and inaccurate prescription “receive date” for the purpose of showing that medco had met contractual turnaround performance standards or for avoiding contractual penalties cancelling prescriptions in doctor call drug utilization review “dur” and other pharmacy areas without attempting to clarify the prescription with the physician or patient dispensing prescriptions without properly performing dur without screening and without appropriately contacting prescribers after screening failing to interpret or evaluate prescriptions and resolve any errors or ambiguities in accordance with state laws regulations and standards of practice improperly using pharmacy technicians and other nonpharmacist personnel to perform functions which must by law be performed by pharmacists or under a pharmacist’s direct supervision submitting claims for prescriptions where medco dispenses less than ie “shorted” the quantity prescribed by the physician and billed by medco establishing managerial structures and practices which had the foreseeable effect of causing inadequate supervision of pharmacy personnel and interfering with professional pharmacists’ ability to exercise independent professional judgment imposing production quotas on professional and support personnel within mail order pharmacies which had the foreseeable effect of interfering with the professional obligation of pharmacists to adequately ensure clarification of prescription drug orders with prescribers prior to dispensing fabricating records of calls to physicians in connection with doctor call dur managed care and other required physician contacts and otherwise creating false records of contact with physicians shipping and billing the government for drugs without ensuring that the correct number strength dosage and type of drugs were dispensed failing to provide accurate complete timely and reliable information to patients and physicians concerning the reasons for costs relating to and effect of drug switches in order to induce them to approve the switch or withdraw their objection to the switch and switching or changing patients’ prescriptions to different more expensive or less effective drugs by providing false misleading or incomplete information or without the knowledge or consent of the patient or physician or without approval of the relevant plan   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest as someone who was at medco same time as mr kornwasser i would tell u to check your facts more carefully before posting this type of stuff for starters he didnt run the specialty or mail order pharmacy business anyone there at the time can tell you that and the lawsuits you mention were dealing with issues dating many years before he and most of us were ever hired at medco that too is easy to check thru publicly available information   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest other companies use the company group chairman title including jnj comp plan was same for anyone that got stock in the company a multiplier of shares based on stock performance directors vps and on up had this plan probably  people at teh company all the same accept pearsons multiplier had no limit which was only unequal aspect of the plan oddest thing about comp has been multimilion signing bonuses of recent hires how do you know he was fired from previous job may have wrong information there youre misinformation destroys the credibility of any good points you may raise also your math calcs need work nowhere near hundred milion   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest anonymous said ↑ as someone who was at medco

informationclick to expand   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest if you were at medco when he was why dont you share with us what he did do there   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest i just did the math would have gotten base salary k plus around  shares a year if he was there for  years thats m  k shares if he sold after he left at around  that works out to  million excluding bonuses on his salary and yes you worked at medco were you a channel stuffer the rx faker the medicare fraud guy and what did mr kornwasser do he reported directly to the ceo so he obviously had to be involved   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest anonymous said ↑ other companies use the company group chairman title including jnj comp plan was same for anyone that got stock in

misinformation destroys the credibility of any good points you may raise also your math calcs need work nowhere near hundred milionclick to expand is that you laizer you seem to know valeant inside out including the bonus structure that most outsiders wouldnt know and you were the only one to work at medco as far as i can tell actually company group chairman was created for you laizer kornwasser and the  guys from medicalis who were also both execs when it was convicted of fraud multiple times for stock fraud my my   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest laizer you really goofed there

misinformation destroys the credibility of any good points you may raise also your math calcs need work nowhere near hundred milionclick to expand laizer is that you you had to be an insider at valeant management to know the compensation structure and only one person was ever hired from medco at valeant   quote  anonymous nov   at  pm anonymous guest what exactly did laizer kornwasser do when he was responsible for us distribution for valeant   quote  anonymous nov   at  am anonymous guest medco was known for being the most fraudulent pharma co but was never nailed with criminal penalties rumours are corrupt officials were paid off anwyays after dozens of lawsuits against medco of which laizer was basically ceo they settled and the bush admin forced them into a corp compliance agreement every type of fraud was admitted to there are so many lawsuits and prosecutions for fraud at medco it is unbelievable the most recent lawsuit was filed oct  in delaware furthermore it details exactly how laizer got around the fed agreement laizer gave himself away in the laizer thread hes shitting himself hes going down hard wouldnt be surprised if he dies alone in a cell in a penn he made hundreds of millions with pearson cooking the books well fuck him time to pay your dues motherfucker   quote  anonymous nov   at  am anonymous guest idk mr left why dont you tell us what you think and stop hiding behind anonymous post on here   quote  anonymous nov   at  am anonymous guest anonymous said ↑ laizer is that you you had to be an insider at valeant management
