bloomberg photo illustration tom hallbloomberg softbank’s vision fund eyes investment in quantum computing by jeremy kahn jeremyakahn more stories by jeremy kahn june    am edt firm wants to fund creation of de facto industry standard softbank’s nyatta worries technology still too immature softbank group corp’s vision fund is scouting for possible investments in quantum computing an experimental science being researched by companies such as google and ibm to succeed current computer processor technologyshu nyatta who helps invest money for the fund said the group wanted to find and back the company whose quantum computing hardware or software that runs atop it would become the “de facto industry standard”“we are happy to invest enough to create that standard around which the whole industry can coalesce” nyatta said speaking during a panel discussion at a conference on quantum computing in munich thursday the vision fund which has attracted investment from the public investment fund of saudi arabia apple inc and other large institutional backers is investing in cutting edge technologies from virtual reality to the internet of things it recently invested  million for a minority stake in improbable a londonbased simulation and virtual reality software startup that has few customers and little revenuequantum scienceonce considered purely theoretical researchers have made strides in building functioning quantum computers based around a number of different designs and approaches international business machines corp alphabet inc’s google and rigetti computing a san franciscobased quantum computing startup have created working machines around one method while ionq a spinout from the university of maryland and duke university is working on technologies based on another microsoft is backing a third architecture but has yet to create a working machine dwave a canadian company is the only firm to sell quantum computers today dwave’s system is based around yet another architecture but its machine can only solve a limited set of problems compared to those google ibm and the others have been working on “after years in the lab there is a growing consensus among investors that we are now on the cusp of a breakout decade in quantum computing” jason whitmire a general partner at blueyard capital the berlinbased venture capital firm that hosted the conference at which nyatta spoke “we see some of the smartest minds driving advances among a multitude of architectures that are nearing market readiness exclusive insights on technology around the world get fully charged from bloomberg technology sign up in conventional computing information is encoded in bits that can have a value of either  or  in quantum computing information is encoded in qubits that take advantage of quantum mechanical principals such as superposition which allows the qubit to be both  and  simultaneously in theory a quantum computer could tackle complex problems in seconds or minutes that would take a conventional supercomputer many hours or days to completegene sequencing nyatta compared what needed to happen in quantum computing to what has happened in genomics where illumina inc’s gene sequencing technology has become the technology around which an entire ecosystem of companies has been built or what has happened in artificial intelligence where nvidia corp’s graphics processors have become the preferred hardware on which to run neural networks“we are happy to do it alone and at massive size to facilitate the future” nyatta said speaking of

purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads
