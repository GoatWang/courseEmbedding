blending quantitative research with fundamental analysisnews uncategorized perspectives october  we view recent activity as indicative of a new reality in equity markets that the market structure is radically different today than it was a decade ago and the old rules no longer apply recent volatility in equity fixed income and commodity markets was driven mostly by macro factors recession fears in europe concerns regarding weakness in asia isis ebola and the potential end of fed taper in october fueled extreme negative market reactions and most importantly a notable shortterm decline in liquidity some major equity indices reached correction territory credit markets experienced significant weakness especially the belowinvestmentgrade sectors energy markets saw large declines mostly from geopolitical maneuvering and treasury yields approached decadeslong lows we view the volatility as technically–rather than a fundamentally–driven most importantly we view recent activity as indicative of a new reality in equity markets that the market structure is radically different today than it was a decade ago and the old rules no longer apply absent an exogenous shock like lehman brothers downside volatility is likely to be steep and short while it appears that liquidity has decreased we believe the opposite is true – liquidity is much deeper than it used to be and the liquidity suppliers are more disciplined which means liquidity suppliers disappear and reappear quickly in other words we think the days of the “capitulation trade” so frequently referenced on cnbc are over there are simply too many pools of capital today levered and unlevered oriented toward shortterm trading or not that capital ultimately fills the vacuum vshaped recoveries in stock prices are here to stay in credit markets we saw significant weakness in bank loans and high yield most likely driven by retail outflows fundamentally corporate balance sheets remain healthy and the corporate default environment remains benign while yields have increased significantly considering the low default environment high recovery value and its floating rate nature we believe this new improved entry price point for bank loans is a compelling value likewise we see the same in high yield despite its fixed rate coupons however but not surprisingly during this period of increased volatility the investment grade corporate market and liquid assetbacked securities market remained relatively stable highlighting the benefits of allocating to this asset class the big declines in energy prices will ultimately have a net positive impact on the us economy citigroup research projected the impact of lower energy prices to represent approximately a  trillion stimulus to global economies lower energy prices may also have the potential to dampen further escalation of hostilities in ukraine as the russian economy is highly dependent on energy exports indeed we believe the move down in oil prices was orchestrated by saudi arabia in part to put pressure on russia overall we believe that the macro variables support our thesis of continued us economic expansion for this reason we believe that the current fixed income market volatility represents opportunistic entry points for selective investment positions this however should be done with caution as macro catalysts could continue to shift the markets and inject volatility pdf version november  by crowp httpscppinvestcomwpcontentuploadscppstackedrightxxpng   crowp httpscppinvestcomwpcontentuploadscppstackedrightxxpng crowp  perspectives
