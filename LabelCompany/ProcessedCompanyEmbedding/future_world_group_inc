company follows section  of the fasb accounting standards codification which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of income and comprehensive income in the period that includes the enactment date the company adopted section  of the fasb accounting standards codification section  with regards to uncertainty income taxes section  addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements under section  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent  likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement section  also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties on income taxes accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures the company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of section  stockbased compensation we account for equitybased transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of asc topic no   equitybased payments to nonemployees asc  asc  establishes that equitybased payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued whichever is more reliably measurable the fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant the fair value of equity instruments other than common stock is estimated using the blackscholes option valuation model in general we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract we account for employee stockbased compensation in accordance with the guidance of fasb asc topic   compensationstock compensation which requires all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values the fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paidin capital over the period during

notification that we had retained the accounting firm of michael gillespie  associates pllc that accounting firm has audited our financial statements for the fiscal years ended may   and may   and reaudited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended may   item a controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures the term disclosure controls and procedures defined in sec rule ae refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the securities exchange act of  the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within required time periods disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management including its principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report the evaluation date based on that evaluation the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer noted the deficiencies in internal controls identified in this item a accordingly the companys chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded that as of the evaluation date such controls and procedures were not effective   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af the companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of may   using the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso   a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of may   the company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below    we do not have an audit committee  while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee it is management s view that such a committee including a financial expert member is an utmost important entity level control over the companys financial statement currently the singlemember board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities  we did not maintain appropriate cash controls  as of may   the company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions and did not require dual signature on the company s bank accounts alternatively the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the company had very few transactions in the bank account  lack of segregation of dutieswe are currently a shell corporation and have no employees other than our ceo and cfothe same person  therefore all accounting information is currently reviewed only by one person  accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls   as a result of the material weaknesses described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of may   based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by coso   changes in internal control over financial reporting   there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of may   that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   this annual report does not include an attestation report of the companys registered public
