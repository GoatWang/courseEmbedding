equity fund portfolios are invested in a basket of noload funds in the midcap smallcap and international arenas our core investment philosophy encompasses a mix of growth and value investment styles to ensure balanced returns through market cycles     objectives for the fixed income component of a portfolio the lcm fixed income portfolio is customized to each client’s needs our team is experienced in both investment grade taxable and taxfree fixed income securities the team actively manages the duration of the portfolio holdings to control risk and to ensure the appropriate income or total return is being generated for each client’s portfolios depending on the clients’ objectives we will invest a portion of the fixed income allocation into diversified mutual funds to gain exposure to less liquid areas such as high yield bonds a variety of options are available for clients desiring fixed incomes for those seeking taxfree income we manage california tax free bonds in addition to federal tax free bonds from all states we also offer short term cash investment portfolios for those who need to access their cash within the next  years     objectives for the equity component of a portfolio the lcm core equity portfolio seeks to maximize longterm capital appreciation the portfolio invests in a diversified portfolio of common stocks of us companies lcm selects investments from companies in the mid  large cap arena highly speculative or illiquid stocks are not candidates for purchase risk control is an important element in the construction of the portfolio to control risk extreme overweighting or underweighting of the portfolio relative to the sp  is normally avoided to diversify the portfolio consists of  equally weighted positions each making up a small portion of the portfolio in addition we utilize risk management software to understand the relative risk of our holdings to the market risk is also controlled through disciplined purchases at reasonable valuations and seeking out companies with projected above average dividend or cash flow generation which we see as protecting valuation     our equity buy discipline lcm employs a core investment philosophy in the management of the portfolio the core approach provides an opportunity to invest in quality companies with superior earnings growth whose equities are selling at attractive valuations most companies under consideration have a special competitive advantage in their business are focused on shareholder value manage their business for longterm growth not for quarterly reporting employ a discipline in capital spending have a business model focused on recurring revenue streams and demonstrate the ability to generate significant cash flow we establish a buy and sell target on our holdings based on either projected discounted cash flow valuations or multiples of earnings this is a similar method employed by mergers  acquisition firms who buy businesses based on projected cash flow and projected returns on invested capital             design  concept wwwitodscom home  about us  services  strategy  why choose us  contact us disclaimer   leisure capital
