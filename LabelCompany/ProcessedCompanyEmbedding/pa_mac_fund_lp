sets and undertakes key hiv prevention research globally karen buglisi weiler global brand president m·a·c cosmetics as famous for her biannual performances on stage at international artist training meetings as she is for her skyscraping stilettos and bronzed blonde glamour what truly sets karen buglisi global brand president of m∙a∙c cosmetics apart from the crowd is her boundless energy endless enthusiasm and ceaseless dedication to the m∙a∙c family laughing as she addresses her now legendary dance moves ms buglisi says “i think sometimes we’re so serious that we forget to have a little bit of fun my point of view is that if i want our artists to put themselves out there for the brand every day i should put myself out there for them” “karen has superb leadership skills and has been instrumental in developing m∙a∙c into the number one makeup artist brand in the world” says john demsey group president of the estée lauder companies “she has done a tremendous job inspiring our m∙a∙c makeup artists who are at the heart of the brand and the key to our success” seemingly born with a suitcase in hand the indefatigable ms buglisi an army brat was born in japan moved to taiwan and then to california by the time she was four “my father was my hero he was the most disciplined person i ever met in my life i think he set a standard for me and i’ve never forgotten that” after another move to augusta georgia her family settled in washington dc where she discovered the beauty industry at the age of  selling helena rubinstein at the hecht company in prince george’s plaza “i’ve always liked makeup i got the job and thought ‘what a great thing i can wear makeup everyday and teach people about makeup and how you can make yourself feel better and look better’ i never looked at it and said ‘ok one day i’m going to be president of a makeup company’ that never even crossed my mind” working everyday since she was a teenager in addition to raising three sons as a single mother it’s no surprise that ms buglisi describes herself as someone who loves challenges “raising my sons has brought out a strength and determination i was never fully aware of i know many parents can identify with this that strength has been so meaningful as i have navigated through my life i do not scare easily” a member of the board of directors of the m∙a∙c aids fund since  she adds “i remember sitting my kids down and talking to them about being respectful to girl and to always protect themselves by wearing a condom you want to embarrass your sons just have that conversation with them let’s put it this way someone had to do it and it was me it’s just too important not to have it before being recruited by mr demsey in  as vice president of north american sales and artist training and development ms buglisi was national sales manager for the us market for adipar a division of the worldwide fashion house escada and has also held the position of field sales manager for borghese a global cosmetic skincare and fragrance company “servicing customers at retail and learning how to be a merchant have been invaluable in my career i’ve done every job i feel i have the ability to communicate at every level” promoted to global brand president of m∙a∙c cosmetics in  ms buglisi now finds herself involved in all facets of the brand “now i get to work with marketing global communications as well as human resources the maf sales operations artist training and development finance and forecasting it also brings me closer to the creative and product development side james  are great partners it’s so important to have that opportunity to connect all the dots also this position gives me the chance to bring the m∙a∙c family closer together and really unite everybody” asked what she’s most energized about for the future of the brand ms buglisi speaks passionately about the growth of emerging markets like the middle east india brazil and china “we’re paving the way in some of these countries the prestige makeup industry has never existed we’re actually developing it as we grow and expand they’re ready for something new and different and we’re the brand that’s perfectly positioned to deliver we know when we have a foundation firmly grounded in our brand dna the sky is the limit it’s a credit to all the teams here working synergistically making the m∙a∙c brand come alive market by market ms buglisi encourages m•a•c artists and employees to participate in all of m•a•c’s fundraising initiatives from viva glam to kids helping kids greeting cards “that’s what i’m most proud of every day we get to make a difference and show the world how passionate we are about helping men women and children affected by hiv and aids we just don’t do the fundraisers where everyone pays a thousand dollars for dinner – it’s one lipstick at a time every single day all around the world” her final message to the work family she believes in so much “you can be whatever you want to be at m•a•c you just have to believe and work hard” clyde williams vice president of state and local government relations center for american progress clyde williams is founder and president of his own business
