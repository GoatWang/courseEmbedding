impact forces that can mechanically damage an area of contact protective gear will typically include padding and a protective shell to reduce the risk of physical head injury liners are provided beneath a hardened exterior shell to reduce violent deceleration of the head in a smooth uniform manner and in an extremely short distance as liner thickness is typically limited based on helmet size considerationsprotective gear is reasonably effective in preventing injury nonetheless the effectiveness of protective gear remains limited consequently various mechanisms are provided to improve protective gear in a biomechanically aware mannerbrief description of the drawingsthe disclosure may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate particular embodimentsfig  illustrates types of forces on axonal fibersfig  illustrates one example of a piece of protective gearfig  illustrates one example of

helmetdescription of example embodimentsreference will now be made in detail to some specific examples of the invention including the best modes contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention examples of these specific embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings while the invention is described in conjunction with these specific embodiments it will be understood that it is not intended to limit the invention to the described embodiments on the contrary it is intended to cover alternatives modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claimsfor example the techniques of the present invention will be described in the context of helmets however it should be noted that the techniques of the present invention apply to a wide variety of different pieces of protective gear in the following description numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention particular example embodiments of the present invention may be implemented without some or all of these specific details in other instances well known process operations have not been described in detail in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present inventionvarious techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes be described in singular form for clarity however it should be noted that some embodiments include multiple iterations of a technique or multiple instantiations of a mechanism unless noted otherwise for example a protective device may use a single strap in a variety of contexts however it will be appreciated that a system can use multiple straps while remaining within the scope of the present invention unless otherwise noted furthermore the techniques and mechanisms of the present invention will sometimes describe a connection between two entities it should be noted that a connection between two entities does not necessarily mean a direct unimpeded connection as a variety of other entities may reside between the two entities for example different layers may be connected using a variety of materials consequently a connection does not necessarily mean a direct unimpeded connection unless otherwise notedoverviewprotective gear includes an outer shell layer connected to a middle shell layer through an outer energy and impact transformer layer the middle shell layer is connected to an inner shell layer through an inner energy and impact transformer layer the outer and inner energy and impact transformer layers flexibly connect the shell layers to absorb impact forces rotational forces shear forces etc and allow the various shell layers to move and slide relative to the other shell layers the outer and inner energy and impact transformer layers may be constructed using gels fluids electrorheological elements magnetorheological elements etc the protective gear may be formed as helmets or body protection for various activities and may be used to protect users from not only impact and penetrative forces but rotational and shear forces as wellexample embodimentsprotective gear such as knee pads shoulder pads and helmets are typically designed to prevent direct impact injuries or trauma for example many pieces of protective gear reduce full impact forces that can structurally damage an area of contact such as the skull or knee major emphasis is placed on reducing the likelihood of cracking or breaking of bone however the larger issue is preventing the tissue and neurological damage caused by rotational forces shear forces oscillations and tensioncompression forcesfor head injuries the major issue is neurological damage caused by oscillations of the brain in the cranial vault resulting in coupcontracoup injuries manifested as direct contusions to the central nervous system cns shear injuries exacerbated by rotational tension compression and or shear forces resulting in demyelination and tearing of axonal fibers and subdural or epidural hematomas because of the emphasis in reducing the likelihood of cracking or breaking bone many pieces of protective gear do not sufficiently dampen transform dissipate andor distribute the rotational tension compression andor shear forces but rather focus on absorbing the direct impact forces over a small area potentially exacerbating the secondary forces on the cns initial mechanical damage results in a secondary cascade of tissue and cellular damage due to increased glutamate release or other trauma induced molecular cascadestraumatic brain injury tbi has immense personal societal and economic impact the center for disease control and prevention documented  million cases of tbi in the usa in  this number was based on patients with a loss of consciousness from a tbi resulting in an emergency room visit with increasing public awareness of tbi this number increased to  million cases in  of these cases there were  deaths and  hospitalizations with the remaining  million cases released from the er of these  million discharged cases at least  people will have significant residual cognitive and behavioral problems at year post discharge from the er notably the cdc believes these numbers under represent the problem since many patients do not seek medical evaluation for brief loss of consciousness due to a tbi these usa numbers are similar to those observed in other developed countries and are likely higher in thirdworld countries with poorer vehicle and head impact protection to put the problem in a clearer perspective the world health organization who anticipates that tbi will become a leading cause of death and disability in the world by the year the cdc numbers do not include head injuries from military actions traumatic brain injury is widely cited as the “signature injury” of operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom the nature of warfare conducted in iraq and afghanistan is different from that of previous wars and advances in protective gear including helmets as well as improved medical response times allow soldiers to survive events such as head wounds and blast exposures that previously would have proven fatal the introduction of the kevlar helmet has drastically reduced field deaths from bullet and shrapnel wounds to the head however this increase in survival is paralleled by a dramatic increase in residual brain injury from compression and rotational forces to the brain in tbi survivors similar to that observed in the civilian population the residual effects of military deployment related tbi are neurobehavioral symptoms such as cognitive deficits and emotional and somatic complaints the statistics provided by the military cite an incidence of  of head injuries in combat zone veterans one might expect these numbers to hold in other countriesin addition to the incidence of tbi in civilians from falls and vehicular accidents or military personnel in combat there is increasing awareness that sportsrelated repetitive forces applied to the head with or without true loss of consciousness can have dire longterm consequences it has been known since the s that boxing is associated with devastating longterm issues including “dementia pugilistica” and parkinsonlike symptoms ie mohammed ali we now know that this repetitive force on the brain dysfunction extends to many other sports football leads the way in concussions with loss of consciousness and posttraumatic memory loss  of all concussions in all sports wrestling comes in second at  and soccer has risen to  of all sports related tbis in the usa  high school students suffer a tbi per year and many of these students have persistent longterm cognitive and behavioral issues this disturbing pattern extends to professional sports where impact forces to the body and head are even higher due to the progressive increase in weight and speed of professional athletes football has dominated the national discourse in the area but serious and progressive longterm neurological issues are also seen in hockey and soccer players and in any sport with the likelihood of a tbi repetitive head injuries result in progressive neurological deterioration with neuropathological findings mimicking alzheimers disease this syndrome with characteristic postmortem neuropathological findings on increases in tau proteins and amyloid plaques is referred to as chronic traumatic encephalopathy ctethe human brain is a relatively delicate organ weighing about  pounds and having a consistency a little denser than gelatin and close to that of the liver from an evolutionary perspective the brain and the protective skull were not designed to withstand significant external forces because of this poor impact resistance design external forces transmitted through the skull to the brain that is composed of over  billion cells and up to a trillion connecting fibers results in major neurological problems these injuries include contusions that directly destroy brain cells and tear the critical connecting fibers necessary to transmit information between brain cellscontusion injuries are simply bleeding into the substance of the brain due to direct contact between the brain and the bony ridges of the inside of the skull unfortunately the brain cannot tolerate blood products and the presence of blood kicks off a biological cascade that further damages the brain contusions are due to the brain oscillating inside the skull when an external force is applied these oscillations can include up to three cycles back and forth in the cranial vault and are referred to as coupcontra coup injuries the coup part of the process is the point of contact of the brain with the skull and the contracoup is the next point of contact when the brain oscillates and strikes the opposite part of the inside of the skullthe inside of the skull has a series of sharp bony ridges in the front of the skull and when the brain is banged against these ridges it is mechanically torn resulting in a contusion these contusion injuries are typically in the front of the brain damaging key regions involved in cognitive and emotional controlshear injuries involve tearing of axonal fibers the brain and its axonal fibers are extremely sensitive to rotational forces boxers can withstand hundreds of punches directly in the face but a single roundhouse punch or upper cut where the force comes in from the side or bottom of the jaw will cause acute rotation of the skull and brain and typically a knockout if the rotational forces are severe enough the result is tearing of axonsfig  below shows how different forces affect axons compression  and tension  can remove the protective coating on an axon referred to as a myelin sheath the myelin can be viewed as the rubber coating on a wire if the internal wire of the axon is not cut the myelin can regrow and recoat the “wire” which can resume axonal function and brain communication if rotational forces are significant shear forces  tear the axon this elevates the problem since the ends of cut axons do not reattach this results in a permanent neurological deficit and is referred to as diffuse axonal injury dai a major cause of longterm neurological disability after tbisome more modern pieces of protective gear have been introduced with the awareness that significant injuries besides musculoskeletal or flesh injuries in a variety of activities require new protective gear designsus pat no  issued to puchalski describes a helmet with an impact absorbing crumple or shear zone “the shell consists of three or more discrete panels that are physically and firmly coupled together providing rigid protection under most circumstances but upon impact the panels move relative to one another but not relative to the users head thereby permitting impact forces to be dissipated andor redirected away from the cranium and brain within upon impact to the helmet there are sequential stages of movement of the panels relative to each other these movements initially being recoverable but with sufficient vector forces the helmet undergoes structural changes in a predetermined fashion so that the recoverable and permanent movements cumulatively provide a protective ‘crumple zone’ or ‘shear zone’”us pat no  issued to calonge describes “an impact resistant helmet assembly having a first material layer coupled to a second material layer so as to define a gas chamber therebetween which contains a quantity that provides impact dampening upon an impact force being applied to the helmet assembly the helmet assembly further includes a containment layer disposed over the second material layer and structured to define a fluid chamber in which a quantity of fluid is disposed the fluid includes a generally viscous gel structured to provide some resistance against disbursement from an impacted region of the fluid chamber to nonimpacted regions of the fluid chamber thereby further enhance the impact distribution and dampening of the impact force provided by the helmet assembly”us pat no  issued to popovich describes “a helmet for protecting a head by laterally displacing impact forces said helmet comprising a rigid inner shell formed as a single unit a resilient spacing layer disposed outside of and in contact with said inner shell and an articulated shell having a plurality of discrete rigid segments disposed outside of and in contact with said resilient spacing layer and a plurality of resilient members which couple adjacent ones of said rigid segments to one another”us pat no  issued to halstead describes a football helmet with liner sections of different thicknesses and densities the thicker softer sections would handle less intense impacts crushing down until the thinner harder sections take over to prevent bottoming outstill other ideas relate to using springs instead of crushable materials to manage the energy of an impact springs are typically associated with rebound and energy stored by the spring is returned to the head this may help in some instances but can still cause significant neurological injury avoiding energy return to the head is a reason that nonrebounding materials are typically usedsome of the protective gear mechanisms are not sufficiently biomechanically aware and are not sufficiently customized for particular areas of protection these protective gear mechanisms also are not sufficiently active at the right time scales to avoid damage for example in many instances materials like gels may only start to convert significant energy into heat after significant energy has been transferred to the brain similarly structural deformation mechanisms may only break and absorb energy after a significant amount of energy has been transferred to the braincurrent mechanisms are useful for particular circumstances but are limited in their ability to protect against numerous types of neurological damage consequently an improved smart biomechanics aware and energy conscious protective gear mechanism is provided to protect against mechanical damage as well as neurological damageaccording to various embodiments protective gear such as a helmet includes a container device to provide a structural mechanism for holding an energy and impact transformer the design of this element could be a part of the smart energy conscious biomechanics aware design for protection the energy and impact transformer includes a mechanism for the dissipation transformation absorption redirection or forceenergy at the right time scales in some cases as small as a few milliseconds or hundreds of microsecondsin particular embodiments the container mechanism provides structure to allow use of an energy and impact transformer the container mechanism may be two or three shells holding one or more layers of energy and impact transformer materials that is a multiple shell structure may have energy and impact transformer materials between adjacent shell layers the shells may be designed to prevent direct penetration from any intruding or impeding object in some examples the outer shell may be associated with mechanisms for impact distribution energy transformation force dampening and shear deflection and transformation in some examples the container mechanism can be constructed of materials such as polycarbonate fiberglass kevlar metal alloys combinations of materials etcaccording to various embodiments the energy and impact transformer provides a mechanism for the dissipation transformation absorption and redirection of force and energy at the appropriate time scales the energy and impact transformer may include a variety of elements in some examples a mechanical transformer element connects multiple shells associated with a container mechanism with mechanical structures or fluids that help transform the impact or shear forces on an outer shell into more benign forces or energy instead of transferring the impact or shear forces onto an inner shellin some examples a mechanical transformer layer is provided between each pair of adjacent shells the mechanical transform may use a shear trusslike structure connecting an outer shell and an inner shell that dampens any force or impact in some examples shear truss structure layers connect an outer shell to a middle shell and the middle shell to an inner shell according to various embodiments the middle shell or center shell may slide relative to the inner shell and reduce the movement andor impact imparted on an outer shell in particular embodiments the outer shell may slide up to several centimeters relative to the middle shell in particular embodiments the material used for connecting the middle shell to the outer shell or the inner shell could be a material that absorbsdissipates mechanical energy as thermal energy or transformational energy the space between the outer shell the middle shell and the inner shell can be filled with absorptivedissipative material such as fluids and gelsaccording to various embodiments the energy and impact transformer may also include an electrorheological element different shells may be separated by an electrorheological element with electric field dependent viscosity the element may essentially stay solid most of the time when there is stressstrain on an outer shell the electric field is activated so that the viscosity changes depending on the level of stressstrain shear forces on an inner shell are reduced to minimize impact transmissionin particular embodiments the energy and impact transformer also includes a magnetorheological element various shells may be separated by magneto rheological elements with magnetic field dependent viscosity the element may essentially stay solid most of the time when there is stressstrain on an outer shell the magnetic field is activated so that the viscosity changes depending on the level of stressstrain shear forces on an inner shell are reduced to minimize impact transmissionelectrorheological and magnetorheological elements may include smart fluids with properties that change in the presence of electric field or a magnetic field some smart fluids undergo changes in viscosity when a magnetic field is applied for example a smart fluid may change from a liquid to a gel when magnets line up to create a magnetic field smart fluids may react within milliseconds to reduce impact and shear forces between shellsin other examples foam and memory foam type elements may be included to absorb and distribute forces in some examples foam and memory foam type elements may reside beneath the inner shell a magnetic suspension element may be used to actively or passively reduce external forces an inner core and an outer core may be separated by magnets that resist each other eg npoles opposing each other the inner and outer cores naturally would want to move apart but are pulled together by elastic materials when an outer shell is impact and the magnets are pushed closer forces between the magnets increase through the air gapaccording to various embodiments a concentric geodesic dome element includes a series of inner shells each of which is a truss based geodesic dome but connected to the outer geodesic through structural or fluidic mechanisms this allows each geodesic structure to fully distribute its own shock load and transmit it in a uniform manner to the dome underneath the sequence of geodesic structures and the separation by fluid provides uniform force distribution andor dissipation that protects the inner most shell from these impactsin particular embodiments a fluidaccordion element would separate an inner shell and an outer shell using an accordion with fluidgel in between this would allow shock from the outer core to be transmitted and distributed through the enclosed fluid uniformly while the accordion compresses to accommodate strain a compressed fluidpistonspring element could include pistoncylinder like elements with a compressed fluid in between that absorbs the impact energy while increasing the resistance to the applied force the design could include additional mechanical elements like a spring to absorbdissipate the energyin still other examples a fiber element involves using a rippled outer shell with texture like that of a coconut the outer shell may contain dense coconut fiber like elements that separate the inner core from the outer core the shock can be absorbed by the outer core and the fibrous filling other elements may also be included in an inner core structure in some examples a thick stretchable gel filled bag wrapped around the inner shell could expand and contract in different areas to instantaneously transfer and distribute forces the combination of the elasticity of a bag and the viscosity of the gel could provide for cushioning to absorbdissipate external forcesaccording to various embodiments a container device includes multiple shells such as an outer shell a middle shell and an inner shell the shells may be separated by energy and impact transformer mechanisms in some examples the shells and the energy and impact transformer mechanisms can be integrated or a shell can also operate as an energy and impact transformerfig  illustrates one example of a particular piece of protective gear helmet  includes a shell layer  and a lining layer  the shell layer  includes attachment points  for a visor chin bar

activity a helmet is designed for in some examples custom foam may be injected into a fitted helmet to allow for personalized fit in other examples differently sized shell layers and lining layers may be provided for various activities and head sizesthe shell layer  and lining layer  protect the skull nicely and have resulted in a dramatic reduction in skull fractures and bleeding between the skull and the brain subdural and epidural hematomas military helmets use kevlar to decrease penetrating injuries from bullets shrapnel etc unfortunately these approaches are not well designed to decrease direct forces and resultant coupcontra coup injuries that result in both contusions and compressiontension axon injuries furthermore many helmets do not protect against rotational forces that are a core cause of a shear injury and resultant longterm neurological disability in civilian and military personnel although the introduction of kevlar in military helmets has decreased mortality from penetrating head injuries the survivors are often left with debilitating neurological deficits due to contusions and diffuse axonal injuryfig  illustrates one example of a container device system

shell  a middle shell  and an inner shell  may hold energy and impact transformative layers  and  between them energy and impact transformer layer  residing between shells  and  may allow shell  to move andor slide with respect to middle shell  by allowing sliding movements that convert potential head rotational forces into heat or transformation energy shear forces can be significantly reducedsimilarly middle shell  can move and slide with respect to inner shell  in some examples the amount of movement andor sliding depends on the viscosity of fluid in the energy and impact transformer layers  and  the viscosity may change depending on electric field or voltage applied in some other examples the amount of movement andor sliding depends on the materials and structures of materials in the energy and impact transformer layers  and according to various embodiments when a force is applied to an outer shell  energy is transferred to an inner shell  through a suspended

shell  the conical structures in energy and impact transformer layer  and the conical structures in energy and impact transformer layer  may or may not be aligned in some examples the conical structures in layer  are misaligned with the conical structures in layer  to allow for improved shear force reductionin some examples conical structures are designed to have a particular elastic range where the conical structures will return to the same structure after force applied is removed the conical structures may also be designed to have a particular plastic range where the conical structure will permanently deform if sufficient rotational or shear force is applied the deformation itself may dissipate energy but would necessitate replacement or repair of the protective gearconical structures are effective in reducing shear rotational and impact forces applied to an outer shell  conical structures reduce shear and rotational forces applied from a variety of different directions
