fall of rome the only means by which we can learn from one of the greatest empires is through its surviving pieces while appian draws from other historians and writers his roman history remains the only surviving account of the roman civil wars the period between the reigns of polybius and cicero and the third punic war and destruction of carthage like many ancient historians appian gives a rare glimpse into the psyches ideologies and moralities of key people through speeches he himself constructed to the modern historian this creative license contaminates the facts while to the ancient historian conveying the political intentions and moral principles that inspired the world’s great leaders were every bit as important as the facts themselves while his sources are not formally provided scholars conclude from references within his writings that appian’s original sources likely include the works of polybius paulus claudius hieronymus caesar augustus and asinius pollio of the original  books of appian’s roman history only half have survived those that remain provide invaluable insight into roman culture politics and history found nowhere else appian picks up where dionysius leaves off diving into the punic wars in volume  and ending with the civil wars this collection contains the complete texts in their loeb classical library editions each text is included in

destroyed rome emerge in this colorful richly textured history as a much more complex—and far more interesting—factor in the expansion and eventual unmaking of the roman empire thomas s burns marshals an abundance of archeological and literary evidence as well as three decades of study and experience to bring forth an unusually farsighted and wideranging account of the relations between romans and nonromans along the frontiers of western europe from the last years of the republic into late antiquitylooking at a year time span beginning with early encounters between barbarians and romans around  bc and ending with the spread of barbarian settlement in the western empire around ad  burns removes the barbarians from their narrow niche as invaders and conquerors and places them in the broader context of neighbors sometimes bitter friends and settlers his nuanced history subtly shows how romes relations with the barbarians—and vice versa—slowly but inexorably evolved from general ignorance hostility and suspicion toward tolerance synergy and integration what he describes is in fact a drawnout period of acculturation characterized more by continuity than by change and conflict and leading to the creation of a new romanobarbarian hybrid society and culture that anticipated the values and traditions of medieval civilization  preview this book » what people are saying  write a
