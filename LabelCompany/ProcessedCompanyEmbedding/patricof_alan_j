this page continue reading the main story photo the floor of the new york stock exchange credit kena betancurgetty images my fellow venture capitalists and private equity investors are paying close attention to the heated electionyear rhetoric about the future of “carried interest” which is the performance fee we charge to manage other people’s money carried interest is the fund manager’s share of the earnings from a profitable investment normally paid on top of a much smaller management feeit’s also a subject of increasing political disfavor over the past year every major presidential candidate — from jeb bush and donald j trump to hillary clinton and bernie sanders — has called for an end to a tax loophole that exists for carried interest mrs clinton has vowed that if congress does not close the loophole as president she would ask the treasury department to use its regulatory authority to do soultimately the controversy has to do with tax fairness or the lack thereof instead of being taxed as wages or commissions earned carried interest is currently taxed as if it were a personal investment or capital gains this gives us a significant tax advantage since the capital gains tax rate is about  percent lower than the top rate on ordinary incomewhen i started my first fund alan patricof associates in  i vividly remember my accountant telling me about my first sale of an investment “we’re going to treat this as capital gain but sooner or later it will be characterized as ordinary income” advertisement continue reading the main story that was  years ago — and virtually nothing has changedother countries have taken action britain recently recognized the wisdom of doing away with the special tax treatment of carried interest by maintaining a much higher tax rate on such income but not the united states continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story it is past time for that to change and for fund managers like myself to accept the reality we should not be receiving a tax break meant for investors when our work does not involve the risk of our own investment of capitalas the former treasury secretary larry summers once said of carried interest “rarely has a policy existed so long with such weak arguments in its favor”the capital gains tax benefit was originally created for people who invested with their own

have their own capital invested in their own or any funds they deserve capital gains treatment just as any other limited partner does but the same does not hold true for a general partnerthe general partner is managing the funds of others and rarely puts his own money into the initial investment the risk he takes is that his ultimate payout is not guaranteed unless the venture is profitable — which is very different from the investor who is putting his own money at stakeand there is a cost according to the congressional joint committee on taxation carried interest costs the american people nearly  billion in tax receipts every year while eliminating the carried interest advantage would make only a small dent in the national debt it would send a meaningful message to the american peoplemost important it comes back to a question of fairness our current political and cultural environment is marred by a toxic belief that the country’s economic order is rigged against ordinary americans — that the world of high finance unjustly supersedes their rights needs and wants advertisement continue reading the main story a new report by gallup found that  percent of americans agreed that members of congress paid too much attention to what their major financial contributors wanted them to do it feeds the cynicism that is fraying our democracy“congress’s harshest critics” gallup reported “feel more strongly about the undue influence that donors and lobbyists have on congress than they do about any other major criticism of the institution”for that reason alone my fellow venture capitalists and private equity investors should support the closing of the carried interest loophole it would carry great symbolic weight there needs to be a more realistic attitude from those of us who have benefited from the carried interest loophole for too many yearswe need to demonstrate a little more patriotism and a greater sense of fairness even if it affects our pocketbooks

invest than ever before venture capitalists are going on the regional conference circuit to find new deals providing entrepreneurs with one of the best opportunities to get financing that has come along for years by bruce g posner write a comment credit last spring at a conference in albany ny designed to acquaint entrepreneurs with venture capital alan j patricof a new york city venture capitalist was reflecting on his  years as a backer of promising young companies until a couple of years ago he recalls we could invest in nearly anybody we wanted and at very attractive prices but he observes as record dollars have flowed into the hands of the nations venture capitalists and the public equity market has soared the pendulum has been swinging more in favor of those needing money there must be  venture capitalists for you to talk to so its a darn good environment says patricof whose firm has participated in financing such successful companies as apple computer and childcraft education this is the time to quit your job and do what you want to dolured by the recent performance of venture capital professionals investors including a growing number of employeebenefit and collegeendowment funds have been pouring money into risk capital pools like never before in the past three years more than  billion in new funds have come into the market the  billion inflow during  alone was nearly four times the total sum invested from  to  according to stanley pratt president of capital publishing corp in wellesley hills mass which publishes venture capital journal as the increased supply of venture capital money brings hundreds of entrepreneurs out of the woodwork and helps generate dozens of new investment funds it is also fueling a proliferation of venture capital conferences in such cities as albany cleveland and pittsburgh  stops many fund managers didnt often make during the days when money was less plentifulthe venture capitalists who typically seek returns of  to  per year have hardly given up looking for attractive investments in californias silicon valley and massachusettss route  where they have been ubiquitous and mostly successful but the growing competition among fund managers together with the sheer amount of new capital available is prompting many of the managers to spend more time sniffing out earlystage investment prospects in other parts of the country it is a process which at least some venture capitalists believe is being enhanced by the increased number of regional conferences contrary to popular perception says stevan birnbaum a los angeles  based general partner with oxford partner we have to market our money and our abilities to help companies succeed just as entrepreneurs have to sell us on what theyre trying to dothe conferences most of which art jointly organized by universities and accounting firms are providing venture capitalists with opportunities to make initial contacts with a number of companies at once and to establish early impressions about products and management talent  judgments that may be hard to make from a stack of business plans at a seminar last may in albany sponsored by rensselaer polytechnic institute and venture capital journal for example around  professional venture capitalists among them patricof and birnbaum spent two days listening to company presentations and mixing informally with entrepreneurs from more than  businesses based in upstate new york and in new england as well as with big eight and local accountants and attorneys the companies attending the rpi conference mostly earlystage concerns involved in applications of proven technologies represented everything from robotics to biotechnology and solar energyin a field where time can be the most limiting factor its usually hard to justify hopping on a plane to see one company in a region youre not familiar with says birnbaum whose fourman partnership gets about  proposals annually before selecting perhaps  investments by necessity he says most of his traveling is thus associated with deals that have been qualified by the firms analyses or by other venture capitalists looking for coinvestors but if i can get a feel for  or  companies at a twoday conference says birnbaum a former principal with xerox corps venture capital subsidiary thats a fairly productive use of my timeventure capitalists though arent attending conferences solely for the purpose of harvesting the current crop of investment candidates by going into an area says g felda hardymon a partner with bessemer venture partners of new york we can learn an awful lot about whats happening there and begin to develop some strong local contacts with accountants and attorneys particularly in a climate where attractive prospects are being pursued by several competing fund managers at once he notes its important for people to know who we are and be aware of our track recordfor entrepreneurs the regional conferences are providing insights into how venture capitalists evaluate investment prospects and what it takes to rise above the sea of companies looking for backing fouryearold power kinetics inc a  million company in troy ny involved in research and development and the manufacture of renewable energy products for example presented its business plan at the albany conference as a prelude to a serious approach to venture capitalists late this year or in early  says president mark p rice we used it as a learning opportunity and a way to make our next proposals better among the things rice learned was that he and his associates would have to do a much more detailed market analysis in order to be taken seriously by investorsin a similar spirit thomas j gregory president of oneyearold ovation technologies inc of canton mass spent his time in albany talking with fund managers and studying the formal presentations of other companies in an effort to find ways to sharpen his sales pitch when his fundraising efforts get under way during the fall ovation formerly named spectrum group inc a microcomputer software developer hopes to raise  million to market and promote its first product targeted at firsttime executive users based on discussions with venture capitalists gregory was planning to revamp his business plan extensively before pursuing further contacts positioning a product in the market will be the critical thing he says once were ready to go ive got a handful of business cards and im hoping well be able to raise the money were looking for more efficientlyfor other businesses however the conferences have become opportunities to pursue fundraising efforts already in progress one example is athenaeum technology inc a braintree mass startup company developing a  inch harddisk computerstorage system athenaeum presented its business plan which calls for  million of equity to meet current working capital needs at a conference sponsored by the american electronics association last march in monterey calif in may three of the companys top executives traveled to albany to renew relationships with venture capitalists they had previously met and to make initial contacts with othersits all part of our systematic attempt to market the company notes jeanpaul garodel cofounder and marketing vicepresident were trying to build awareness among investors about who we are to get what it is looking for   million for about  of the companys equity  garodel figures athenaeum may have to spend at least six months meticulously following up its leads with potential investors yet no matter how aggressively the company promotes itself he notes it wont be a substitute for the basic requirements any venture capitalist expects from a deal says garodel whoever puts money in the company will be taking a hard look at the management and the productswith so many attractive companies trying to get a piece of the new money venture capitalists say the standards for the deals they do are as high as ever while some lucky entrepreneurs are receiving more favorable prices for their startup businesses than any time before there will always be a lot of losers observes pratt of capital publishing but as venture capitalists devote part of their time to the seminar circuit some companies may find ways to break through the filter if i were trying to build a company id use the conferences and the entire process to build a better business plan says alan patricof in  he and five associates looked at nearly  plans met with about  entrepreneurs and financed just  well do about the same this year patricof says even so there are plenty of others looking for deals he says so one of the most important things is to get your idea listened tostalking
