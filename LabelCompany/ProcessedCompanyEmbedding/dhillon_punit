just heard from will be dr sharron gargosky oncosecs chief regulatory and clinical officer and dr chris twitty our head of clinical science ill take a moment to review the agenda for todays call first ill recap our recent clinical data ill then turn the call over to dr chris twitty to discuss the mechanism and combination rationale for immunopulse il then dr sharron gargosky will provide us with some clinical updates and discuss the clinical collaboration with merck our regulatory pathway for immunopulse il and some details regarding pisces our registration directed study in melanoma after that richard will provide an overview of our third quarter  and nine month financial results finally well open the floor for a qa session all right so over the last several years weve been building a company that has culminated in multiple significant achievements in the first four months of  in february we presented interim data demonstrating that the combination of immunopulse il and keytruda led to a  best overall response rate at  weeks in patients predicted to not respond to an antipd checkpoint therapy this was soon followed by the fda granting fasttrack designation for treatment of melanoma patients who have previously failed opdivo or keytruda therapy with a combination of il and keytruda and lastly we just recently announced our clinical collaboration and supply agreement with merck through which we are securing a drug supply for our soon to be initiated registrationdirected clinical trial pisces as a ceo and founder of oncosec im proud to say that we are a pioneer in intratumoral immunotherapies and now one of the leading immunotherapy companies with a significant lead over others that are now following initiating our pivotal study is an exciting phase in our growth and development as of our technology company and this includes the less visible behindthescenes work regarding the regulatory submissions working with our cros site startup and other initiation activities including negotiation of the many different agreements and contracts related to the pisces study we remain focused on taking the necessary steps to succeed in the registrationdirected pisces trial as we continue to deliver on our mission of addressing an unmet medical need in melanoma with immunopulse il now just wanted to take a moment to recap the clinical development path as i mentioned on may   we announced our collaboration and supply agreement with merck to evaluate the combination of immunopulse il and their bestinclass therapy keytruda in the pisces clinical trial this signifies the completion of one of our major development milestones for  this is the first registrationdirected study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with metastatic melanoma following disease progression on an antipd therapy on our last conference call we provided a summary of the phase ii combination data which we presented at ascositc demonstrating an objective response of  and a best overall response rate of  in  patients after  weeks of combination treatment of the  patients enrolled who are predicted to not respond to antipd therapy nine had previously been treated with at least one checkpoint inhibitor of this subset we noted  demonstrated an objective response in combination of il or immunopulse il and keytruda we believe these are encouraging and note that several companies have now followed the lead of oncosec by exploring the antipd refractory population in melanoma moreover we believe that oncosec to date has provided some of the most comprehensive biomarker analysis in this nonresponder patient population and this underscores the potential for immunopulse il to generate both a local and systemic immune response that potentially results in improved response rates when combined with keytruda with that said ill ask dr chris twitty to join us today to provide a brief review of the immune monitoring data presented at ascositc and provide his perspective on the importance of this data in the context of other combination immunotherapies in the antipd nonresponder population chris twitty thanks punit as you know checkpoint blockade therapies have transformed oncology unfortunately for most indications a significant portion of patients will not respond to therapy allowing their cancers to continue to grow a key question that immunooncologists have come to focus on is why do some patients fail antipd checkpoint blockade therapies while there is likely not a simple answer to this question recent findings finance have shown that both the number of cd positive t cells and levels of pdl in the patient’s tumor microenvironment are important predictors of an effective antipd driven response current efforts to understand the mechanism underlying these observations point to immunogenicity of this tumor as a critical factor which may have tied not only to tumor mediated suppression but also to genetic or epigenetic pathway and even a composition of the patients microbiome before discussing the rationale for its combination with antipd checkpoint blockade i would like to take a moment to highlight immunobiology underlying oncosecs immunopulse il immunopulse il is a gene base that is dna therapeutic delivered intratumorally by electroporation that allows tumors to produce il a proinflammatory cytokine capable of coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses specifically immunopulse il initiates the release of tumorassociated antigens while activating dendritic cells to promote enhanced antigen presentation this in turn promotes an effective priming and polarization of cd positive and cd positive t cell towards th and tc responses respectively in addition to dendritic cells il also augments innate community by increasing natural killer cells thus immunopulse il dependent intratumoral immune modulation effectively transforms a patients treated lesion into an insitu vaccine that primes not only a local but also a systemic immune response increasing the number of cd positive tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes or til oncosecs therapy can release and effectively present tumor antigens inflaming both treated and distal that is nontreated cold tumors with nk cells and th or tc polarized cells however the tumor may increase levels of pdl to apply an immunological break turned adaptive resistance which can diminish the magnitude of an antitumor response thus the synergy of combining immunopulse il with keytruda that is antipd is evident as it allows each therapeutic to work optimally keytruda works by blocking the pd pdl access blunting the effects of adaptive resistance allowing for more robust antitumor immune response and immunopulse il works by altering the immunogenicity of the tumor driving the frequency of tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes at its transformation of a cold to hot tumor these tumors often lead to increased pdl expression on the tumor providing the substrate to maximize the utility of this antibody data to support these mechanisms comes not only from the literature but also from our own immune monitoring and biomarker program fortified with some key collaborations with notable academic and industry leaders i would like to briefly highlight some of the data that is being presented in early  at the aacr and sitc annual meetings as well as recently in  at the ascositc annual meeting working closely with our clinical oncologists to obtain longitudinal biosamples allowing for the interrogation of tumor dna by tcr sequencing demonstrates the significant increase in a fraction of productive t cells and t cell commonality in responding patients further nanostring analysis of tumoral gene expression revealed a significant increase in gene sets related to adaptive and innate immune responses in responding patients using multispectral immunochemistry allowed us to visualize the transformation of cold pretreatment lesions into a hot tumor evidenced by a brisk immune infiltrate with the requisite ratio of cd positive t cell to pd expressing tumors or monocytes this powerful observation occurred at both treated and untreated distill lesions relatedly evaluation of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by elisa and flow cytometry provide additional evidence of a productive systemic immune response collectively data from our immune monitoring program has closely aligned with published literature it is worth noting that while each of these immunological endpoints address different components of tumor or immunobiology the results are overwhelmingly aligned in supporting the previously described mechanisms while these data are coupled with outstanding clinical responses that sharron will speak to next were increasingly confident that this combinatorial approach will make a huge impact in patients who are currently unable to benefit from antipd therapies i would like to turn it over now to sharron gargosky sharron gargosky thanks chris thanks for that wonderful clinical science backup update there so as puneet mentioned our collaboration and supply agreement with merck will support our clinical trial pisces in evaluating this combination of the immunopulse il and their bestinclass keytruda our teams have been working really closely with the merck clinical team to ensure that our pisces protocol meets the standards of both organizations and im really happy to report that we on track to initiate the trial furthermore this collaboration provides oncosec with pharma validation and millions of dollars in savings for the drug supply that we need for our registrationdirected trial so to give you a little update on how the pisces program and the clinical trial is actually progressing right now pisces is the name weve given our phase ii open label multicenter study of il in combination with keytruda in the stage iiiiv melanoma patients pisces stands for antipd il stage iiiiv combination electroporation study so you can see why pisces is a better way for us to refer to it in the trial a total of  eligible patients will be enrolled into this study in the simon stage design with the primary endpoint of best overall response rate by an independent central review group based on our research division  these eligible patients who will be those with stage iii or iv metastatic melanoma who  they will have been progressing or have progressed on either keytruda or opdivo as either a monotherapy or as a combination of those approved therapies currently were working with several prominent research centers in the us and in australia and were going through the rigorous clinical site evaluation and selection process we still do you plan to be open to patient enrollment at the latter part of this month june and although this is a somewhat aggressive timeline as such our team has been working very hard and very closely with all of our collaborators our vendors with merck our cros and as you would expect the drug and device manufacturers so were confidence that we can meet these expectations and in doing so ensure that oncosec maintains its competitive edge all the details of the trial are of course on clinicaltrialsgov so where are we with our regulatory pathway with our fast track designation in hand and this amazing immune monitoring data thats really showing those differences between responder and nonresponders we have our drug available and device and the clinical outcome data to date we really believe that there is a strong potential for an accelerated approval in this nonresponder patient population of course based on the clinical trials outcome so now i would like to hand it back over to punit who will go into further details about our melanoma development strategy thanks punit punit dhillon thank you sharron thats a great update so i would like to outline oncosecs melanoma development strategy and why we believe we have an advantage over many of our competitors to start oncosec was the first and to the best of our knowledge only company to clearly outline a regulatory plan for treating melanoma patients who have previously failed opdivo or keytruda this was validated by the fda granting oncosec clinical trial approval and fast track designation in february of this year its been reviewed and incorporated feedback by multiple regulatory experts and the fda this coupled with the strong data we presented at asco and sitc and the pending start of our pisces trial this really places oncosec in a position where we could be the first company to have a therapy approved in the antipd refractory setting in melanoma second important point here is that a significant benefit of  the significant benefit that we provide comparably to other companies is the intratumoral therapy is safety the clinical data to date for immunopulse il as a single agent or in combination with keytruda has consistently demonstrated a welltolerated and remarkable safety profile so in other words the clinical benefit of immunopulse il is not compromised by the toxicity you may see in other drugs or other combinations and this is very important because less toxicity and fewer safety issues related to the treatment themselves potentially means less burden on the patients and the hospital systems as we continue to take the necessary steps to prepare immunopulse il for commercialization we expect to begin discussing our plans for commercial manufacturing of our product we believe and are confident that the commercial opportunity for immunopulse il to be truly significant antipd refractory melanoma is a major unmet medical need there are currently no available treatment options for patients with metastatic melanoma who have failed antipd therapy and oncosec is in a position to be the first available treatment to this population furthermore as our focus is on bringing the immunopulse il to the market well continue to actively pursue and expand the pipeline with checkpoint combination in multiple indications so were looking to increase the value of our il franchise by doing additional combination lastly oncosec believes that the tumor targeted approach of delivering the right genes to appropriately modified tumor microenvironment and create an immune most suitable for combinations with checkpoint therapies is the best and safest approach for the future of immunotherapy combination the data that we presented to date has demonstrated that delivering il locally with electroporation is both safe and effective and oncosecs mission is to continue to lead the field in tumortargeted delivery of gene so that we can build on the success of the immunopulse il franchise by making available safe and effective technologies that can deliver genes to deeper and more difficult to reach tumors so before i conclude i just want to make a couple other remarks we firmly believe that we have a compelling value proposition for investors and with the successful execution of the pisces trial and potential accelerated approval and the commercialization of immunopulse il we believe that significant value still remains to be realized relative to our current market valuation as such we continue our efforts to communicate our development strategy to current and potential investors including dedicated healthcare institutional funds and we expect that these efforts will result in a broader shareholder base and market cap appreciation so at this point i would like to turn the call over to richard for a financial update richard slansky all right thanks punit and good afternoon again everyone we issued our financial results via a press release today and we filed our form q after the market closed for the third quarter of fiscal  oncosec reported a net loss of  million or  per share compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the same period last year the decrease of  million in net loss for the third quarter ended april   compared to the same period in  resulted primarily from a decrease of  related to our clinical trial costs that were lower due to a lower number of patient enrollments in a smaller number of actively enrolling trials as well as lower trial management costs and a decrease of  related to lower rd salary costs this was offset by  increase in cost related to initial clinical site startup costs in australia and also a decrease of  in stock compensation expenses mainly related to a reduction in the value of equity compensation awards the independent members of our board of directors and a decrease of  in ga salary costs now for the nine months ended april   oncosec reported a net loss of  million or  per share this is compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the same period last year the decrease in net loss for the ninemonth period ended april   compared with the same period in fiscal  resulted primarily from a  million decrease in research and development expenses primarily related to the result and a decrease of  million of clinical trial costs that similar to the quarterly results were due to a lower number of patient enrollments in a smaller number of actively enrolling trials a decrease of  related to lower rd salary costs and a decrease in travel costs of  which was offset by an increase of  related to stock compensation expenses as a result of our tender offer to exchange stock options and an increase of  related to initial clinical startup costs to establish our clinical presence in australia a  million decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a decrease of  million in stock compensation expense a decrease of  in ga salaries and a decrease of  in accounting fees and a decrease of office supplies of about  offset by an increase in other income of about  there were no revenues for the quarter ended april   or april   at april   oncosec had  million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to  million of cash and cash equivalents at july   our team continues to seek costeffective ways to achieve our goals while maximizing efficiency and prudent spending of our cash resources as you will note in our filings we believe our cash  our current cash funds to be sufficient to allow us to continue to operate our business for at least the next nine months under our current business plan we are actively pursuing various activities that would allow us to fund operations through the completion of our registrationdirected study pisces and beyond now with that id like to pass it over to carmen our operator will open up the conference call to question carmen questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and one first question is from the line of jason mccarthy with maxim group your line is now open jason mccarthy hi guys thanks for taking the questions just a couple for the pisces study depending on the  patients of data that youre expecting towards the end of the year that you could potentially use to convert to a registration study what overall response rate would you consider to be significant enough to approach the fda to see if you can go through a registration sharron gargosky can i speak to that punit punit dhillon yes please sharron gargosky okay so hi this is sharron so i think the first thing is that that number of  isnt any particular magic number there with what we might do to convert and look at this it really being an open label trial that were able to look at at real time of course were going to be evaluating and looking at our subjects as they come in so well just go with as they enroll as the patients come in and what our datasets look like honestly so there is no magic around that particular number but with regards to what we would like to see with regards to like a response rate the agency tends to like to see a  to  i would say my personal judgment a shift in the change of above baseline of what youre seeing in a patient and when we designed this trial doing it  looking at patients who have progressed based on the research criteria you have some level of false positive in there that the literature is well aware of and its been documented so we took a very conservative approach and set that at  of potential falsepositive as our baseline and looked at a  shift above that and so were looking for at least a  response rate in our study if we get more than that as weve seen in the current study that weve been presenting since  that would be terrific right but thats what were actually looking for in our pisces trial jason mccarthy okay great and then punit you had mentioned in the past some new products in the pipeline that have potentially multiantigen dnabased multiple antigens can you give us an update on pipeline progress and when we can expect or anticipate an announcement of the next product that could move into the clinic punit dhillon yes so ill just talk at a highlevel and then sharron or chris feel free to chime in terms of actual developments we have been advancing our immunopulse il at a much faster clip than weve been doing on the preclinical pipeline however we have made a significant investment in ip on the multigene constructs and the new nextgeneration electroporation so there the strategy that weve implored is to continue to look at other codevelopment strategies and most notably our technology access program where were doing several different collaborations where we continue to advance the ip and advance the potential preclinical targets to go into an ind enabling setting so weve recently got to a place where we have selected several candidates that are ready for ind enabling studies but our current resources are really squarely focused on showing value from our clinical program and well look to advance the new multigene constructs and the nextgeneration electroporation with other codevelopment opportunities while were limited in terms of our bandwidth and resources jason mccarthy okay great thank you for taking the questions sharron gargosky no worries operator thank you and our next question comes the line of yi chen with hc wainwright your line is now open yi chen thanks for taking my questions seems you end the quarter with roughly  million and you anticipated to provide cash runway through the first quarter  so does that mean we should expect a cash burn of over  million a quarter once you start the pisces trial richard slansky so as you can tell were currently burning at about  million a quarter and so youll see that number rise as we get further into the pisces trial but we do believe that the cash runway will take us into q of  as we indicated so yes it will increase slightly as we move forward but it will compensate for us under  million now yi chen okay and the lowered amount of stockbased compensation in the reported quarter will maintain in the coming quarters too richard slansky yes thats correct and the particular compensation had to do with a one year vesting and that was a onetime event yi chen okay got it thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of kumar raja with noble capital your line is now open kumar raja thank you for taking my questions i had a couple of questions one on the clinical sites so how many sites do you plan to have and what else remains to be done before you can open the site for enrolling the patients and out of these sites how many have already experience with the il immunopulse sharron gargosky okay so the number of sites we planned in the protocol kumar i put out two study sites im looking at initially having  up and running and ready whats required is kind of the classic pathway right of clinical you have to get your ethics approval which i can say we have at a couple of central irvs you have to get through contracts and budgets which were in good discussions with right now and then with that you can start the trial and do the site initiation visits so were in a good place there with as i said central approval already of the trail by a couple of different ethics major boards sites all with contracts and budgets and those dialogues going underway so what do we have to do to get them started get the contract signed basically and go out and initiate them of those sites who has experience with our existing technology yes we have some sites that we have worked with before involved in this trial as i can update clinicaltrialsgov ill put more on there once their contracts are signed so were going back to some of our familiar groups who have extensive experience with electroporation some new centers that have experience with electroporation but perhaps from a different framework like chemo electroporation and thats why i feel pretty confident that we will have sites open and be ready this month kumar raja and how many of these sites already have experience with il and also may be a little bit of color on the collaboration with merck how much involvement will merck have in the following of the clinical trials as well as the progress of the clinical trials sharron gargosky yeah so who have experience with il of the handful weve got right now i would say that  of them have experience with the therapies and all of the electroporation combination space there like that and where mercks involvement is well merck was incredibly involved in our early dialogues around the clinical protocol in the science of what we were doing with our immune monitoring they did a rigorous assessment of what we were doing and how we were doing and we had a lot of conversations with chris and the teams with our clinical protocol we went through extensive review with merck recognizing that this could be an accelerated approval pathway with commercialization it went through extensive reviews internally there but what they expect on the backend once the study actually is running is just a general update so i have personally a weekly call with my liaison there just to tell them how things are progressing and that when meeting our own internal deadlines and then once every quarter we provide a certain amount of update which is very similar to what we will be doing with our dsmb board that we have involved to look at safety and general update on the trial so their oversite is nothing particularly arduous its very much what you might expect of a sponsor just wanting to know how the study is progressing and are there any safety issues with the trial kumar raja okay great thanks for taking my questions sharron gargosky no worries operator thank you and our next question is from the line of michael brunswick with national securities your line is now open michael hi i have  apologies i had to jump on an off so i missed a couple of things but on this quarter compared to the quarter last year this is one of the reasons why the cost were down is because of slower enrollments i think is that right sharron gargosky yeah michael and do you expect the enrollments to pick up and then is that going to increase the cost punit dhillon michael you should put that in content in terms of what the current development objectives are and versus the prior trials so sharron can outline that for you sharron gargosky yeah so hi michael so the things that we  the reasons why we have these reduced cost is that weve been very proactively cleaning up and closing up trials internally that were running at within oncosec monotherapy studies have closed our medical cell studies have closed out head and neck study is closed so a number of trials that we were running we had now closed them and gone through database lock and getting those clinical study reports done so you can imagine that huge cost burn of just having that infrastructure of that trials running is now gone and not part of our budget lines and we were able to accomplish that in a very timely way so i think that was great and then similarly with a number of our vendors honestly just working with them and renegotiating or adjusting contracts appropriately can make a huge difference with a little fiscal responsibility there and then i guess the third and the final part was with one of the studies the triple negative breast cancer study it has been a slower enrolling trial with just a single site and one of the pis being alpha for a bit so weve had a little bit of slow enrollment there again that we intended to accrue and havent been able to as proactively so i think that culmination of events has really led to these inferred savings and decrease in our clinical trials cost and spends that we had thought punit dhillon yes and if i could just add michael one thing i would add to that is that this has been very deliberate and strategic about where did we see the il program can have the most value with all the data that was accumulated last year so we had over  patients between multiple different clinical trials in monotherapy setting so what we wanted to really set is if there is a development path and lets focus in all of our resources on the development path that can really get us approval and weve identified that melanoma would be the best route relative to our other indications that doesn’t mean that were not interested in combination opportunities in those other indications now that we have a larger data set but for us melanoma definitely stands up because there is a clear unmet need we had dialogue with the agency and this fast track designation that lays out there is this population of patients that dont have any available treatment options and there were also in the lead so its a very clear opportunity for us to focus on and focus our resources on michael okay thank you finally on this collaboration with merck theyre going to supply the product do they supply it to big discount for free whats the deal or is it not public sharron gargosky its a classic type of material transfer agreement so were getting the product per se for free it comes to us as naked vials that we label appropriately for our clinical trial and kit and distribute so the product itself is free the labeling kitting and distribution becomes our cost center and responsibility michael got it thanks sharron gargosky no worries operator thank you and our question is a followup from yi chen with hc wainwright your line is open yi chen hi thank you just a quick followup so regarding the longterm followup data from the first cohort patient for an investigator sponsored trial what long term timeframe we will be looking at and can that data potentially be reported before the primary data readout from the pisces trial sharron gargosky yeah do you want me to tackle that one as well punit punit dhillon yes that will be great sharron gargosky all right hey yeah a good question yes the longterm followup on the patients we have in the ist study does need to be extracted monitored and evaluated i havent done it today we had patients currently at two years plus in the trial a number of patients still in remission and on holiday and youre exactly right with that i need to get that data out and look at it when we get the majority of these patients to  months which will be before the pisces readout at this stage has not been done should be done will be done yi chen thank you very much sharron gargosky no worries operator thank you and this concludes our qa session for today ill turn the call back to management for any final comments punit dhillon well thank you all for participating in our third quarter conference call we look forward to the months ahead and

hr rule no  your hire your fire by jen st denis  nov    pm punit dhillon ceo oncosec medical punit dhillon now  was previously vicepresident of finance at inovio pharmaceuticals in san diego he was responsible for raising investor capital for the biotech company which specialized in making products to treat skin cancer when it came time to start his own company in  the vancouverraised dhillon was torn should he start his new company in british columbia or california the biotech funding landscape at the time determined his next move i did look at starting it in vancouver and unfortunately the decision came down to opening doors said dhillon i have a lot of resources in vancouver but ive had to leverage those from san diego some of the challenges dhillon faced were raising capital and the adoption of the new technology his company oncosec medical makes an immunotherapy skin cancer treatment but he also made the mistake of hiring a close friend and a cofounder of oncosec as coo of the company a year later he made the difficult decision to fire the coo unfortunately he was not able to deliver under the responsibilities of that role and that impacted the company as a whole because we were such a lean company dhillon said in hindsight dhillon thinks he should have spent more time vetting his friend before hiring him since then the company has tightened up its hiring practices and employment decisions are no longer dhillons alone to make as a startup i kept more flexibility in my hiring decisions because it was just me making that decision dhillon said but as the company has grown weve had more resources to rely on so we can make the decision to hire the individuals that fit the company on creating a company culture  i think its super important to invest in your employees and to have them invested in the companys execution thats something that took me a while to grasp … its really developing the culture in the organization so people really understand what were doing … we have several different health and wellness programs that are reinforcing that they come first i believe in the philosophy that if you invest in your employees they will invest in

life lessons punit dhillon corporate hr rule no  your hire your fire by jen st denis  nov    pm punit dhillon ceo oncosec medical punit dhillon now  was previously vicepresident of finance at inovio pharmaceuticals in san diego he was responsible for raising investor capital for the biotech company which specialized in making products to treat skin cancer when it came time to start his own company in  the vancouverraised dhillon was torn should he start his new company in british columbia or california the biotech funding landscape at the time determined his next move i did look at starting it in vancouver and unfortunately the decision came down to opening doors said dhillon i have a lot of resources in vancouver but ive had to leverage those from san diego some of the challenges dhillon faced were raising capital and the adoption of the new technology his company oncosec medical makes an immunotherapy skin cancer treatment but he also made the mistake of hiring a close friend and a cofounder of oncosec as coo of the company a year later he made the difficult decision to fire the coo unfortunately he was not able to deliver under the responsibilities of that role and that impacted the company as a whole because we were such a lean company dhillon said in hindsight dhillon thinks he should have spent more time vetting his friend before hiring him since then the company has tightened up its hiring practices and employment decisions are no longer dhillons alone to make as a startup i kept more flexibility in my hiring decisions because it was just me making that decision dhillon said but as the company has grown weve had more resources to rely on so we can make the decision to hire the individuals that fit the company on creating a company culture  i think its super important to invest in your employees and to have them invested in the companys execution thats something that took me a while to grasp … its really developing the culture in the organization so people really understand what were doing … we have several different health and wellness programs that are reinforcing that they come first i believe in the philosophy that if you invest in your employees they will invest in our customers • comments on this topic join the discussion please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus comments powered by disqus share
