times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit with goodwill may not be recoverable during the first quarter of  the company assessed goodwill for impairment due to the change in reportable segments which also resulted in changes to several reporting units as a result the company performed impairment testing for goodwill under the reporting unit structure immediately before the change and determined that no impairment existed the company reallocated goodwill to the new reporting units under the new reporting structure and performed impairment testing for goodwill under the new segment reporting structure immediately after the change and determined that a  million goodwill impairment existed within one of the ccs reporting units at january   the impairment test was performed using a discounted cash flow dcf valuation model significant assumptions in the dcf model are annual revenue growth rates annual operating income margins and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections the discount rate was based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date for market participants in our reporting units’ industries   results for the three and nine months ended september   included a goodwill impairment charge of  million in the cms segment property plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets assets identified as impaired are carried at estimated fair value during the three months ended september   as a result of revisions to the business plan for a particular product line the company determined that certain intangible assets in the ccs segment were no longer recoverable and a  million impairment charge was recorded    commscope holding company inc notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in thousands unless otherwise noted   results

above there were no other material asset impairments identified during the three or nine months ended september   or  income taxes the effective income tax rate of  and  for the three and nine months ended september   respectively was lower than the statutory rate of  primarily due to a reduction in tax expense related to uncertain tax positions and the release of valuation allowances related to certain foreign deferred tax assets the effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that the company does not plan to repatriate  these earnings are generally taxed at rates lower than the united states us statutory rate offsetting these decreases for the nine months ended september   was the effect of the provision for state income taxes as well as the goodwill impairment for which only partial tax benefits were recorded   the effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended september   reflected the impact of impairment charges for which minimal tax benefits were recorded the effective income tax rate was favorably affected by the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate benefits recognized from adjustments related to prior years’ tax returns and a reduction in tax expense related to uncertain tax positions these benefits were partially offset by losses in certain jurisdictions where the company did not recognize tax benefits due to the likelihood of them not being realizable earnings per share basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share is based on net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of potentially dilutive common shares using the treasury stock method potentially dilutive common shares include outstanding equitybased awards stock

loss method used for determining credit losses on financial assets including trade receivables with an expected credit loss method  asu no  is effective for the company as of january   and early adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on the company’s consolidated financial statements and when it may be adopted in march  the fasb issued asu no  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee equitybased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows asu no  is effective for the company as of january   and early adoption is permitted the company plans to adopt this asu as of january   and does not expect that its application will have a significant impact on income before income taxes however it may impact the company’s net income because excess tax benefits or deficiencies which are currently reflected in additional paid in capital must be reflected in income tax expense under asu no  the significance of the impact will depend on the intrinsic value at the time of vesting or exercise of equitybased compensation awards the impact to the consolidated statements of cash flows will be to present excess tax benefits or deficiencies as an operating activity instead of a financing activity the company also expects to make an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur in february  the fasb

obligations created by leased assets previously classified as operating leases   asu no  is effective for the company as of january   and early adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on the company’s consolidated financial statements and when it may be adopted in january  the fasb issued asu no  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  which modifies how entities measure equity investments except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment changes presentation and disclosure requirements and clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to availableforsale securities in combination with the entity’s other deferred tax assets the guidance is effective for the company as of january   and with the exception of certain provisions early adoption is not permitted the company is evaluating the impact of this new guidance on the company’s consolidated financial statements in july  the fasb issued asu no  simplifying the measurement of inventory  the guidance requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value which is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation this guidance simplifies the prior guidance by eliminating the options of measuring inventory at replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin this guidance is effective for the company as of january   with early adoption permitted the company plans to adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of  and does not expect a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements in may  the fasb issued asu no  revenue from contracts with customers  the new accounting standard defines a single comprehensive model in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the core principle of the asu is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services in august  the fasb deferred the effective date of asu no  by one year  during  the fasb has issued additional accounting standard updates clarifying the guidance in asu no   the company will be required to adopt the new standard including subsequent clarifying guidance as of january   using either i full retrospective application to each prior reporting period presented or ii modified retrospective application with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application and providing certain additional required disclosures the company plans to adopt the new accounting model as of january

respectively of restructuring costs primarily related to the bns acquisition integration activities we expect to incur significant cash costs over the next two years to complete the integration of the bns acquisition as of january   we reorganized our internal management and reporting structure as part of the integration of the bns acquisition  the reorganization changed the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance  as a result we are reporting financial performance for  based on our new operating segments commscope connectivity solutions ccs and commscope mobility solutions cms  prior to this change we operated and reported based on the following operating segments wireless enterprise broadband and bns  all prior period amounts throughout our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes critical accounting policies there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies or significant accounting estimates as disclosed in our  annual report on form k except as disclosed below assets impairment reviews  interim goodwill analysis we test goodwill for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may no longer be recoverable during the first quarter of  we reorganized our internal management and reporting structure and as a result realigned our goodwill reporting units we tested goodwill for possible impairment prior to the realignment and no impairment was indicated we then reallocated goodwill to the new reporting units based on relative fair value as required by gaap after the reallocation a step one goodwill impairment test was performed for each of the new reporting units  one reporting unit in the ccs segment did not pass step one and a step two test was performed based on the results of the step two    test a  million goodwill impairment charge was recorded as of january   the impairment test was performed using a discounted cash flow dcf valuation model significant assumptions in the dcf model are annual revenue growth rates annual operating income margins and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections the discount rate was based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date for market participants in our reporting units’ industries comparison of results of operations for the

toggle notes this reduction in interest expense in the third quarter was partially offset by the writeoff of  million in debt issuance costs related to the august  redemption the increase in net

resulted in pretax gains of  million income taxes our effective income tax rate of  and  for the three and nine months ended september   respectively was lower than the statutory rate of  primarily due to a reduction in tax expense related to uncertain tax positions and the release of valuation allowances related to certain foreign deferred tax assets the effective income tax rate was also favorably affected by the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that we do not plan to repatriate  these earnings are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate offsetting these decreases for the nine months ended september   was the effect of the provision for state income taxes as well as the goodwill impairment for which only partial tax benefits were recorded our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended september   reflected the impact of impairment charges for which minimal tax benefits were recorded the effective income tax rate was favorably affected by the impact of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate benefits recognized from adjustments related to prior years’ tax returns and a reduction in tax expense related to uncertain tax positions these benefits were partially offset by losses in certain jurisdictions where we did not recognize tax benefits due to the

foreign exchange rate changes had a negative impact of approximately  on legacy commscope cms segment net sales for the three and nine months ended september   compared to the prior year periods cms segment operating income increased for the three and nine months ended september   primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the  million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the prior year periods  this impairment charge was excluded from the calculation of nongaap adjusted operating income which increased for the three and nine months ended september   compared to the prior year periods primarily due to more favorable geographic and product mix that was partially offset by lower sales volumes higher variable cash compensation costs and increased rd spending as we continue to invest in small cell technology    our sales to wireless operators can be volatile we expect longerterm demand for our cms products to be positively affected by wireless cove rage and capacity expansion in emerging markets and growth in mobile data services including g deployments in developed markets uncertainty in the global economy or a particular region or consolidation among wireless operators may slow the growth or ca use a decline in capital spending by wireless operators and negatively impact our net sales liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key measures of our liquidity and capital resources       september       december       dollar change      change         dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents                         working

                         working capital consisted of current assets of  million less current liabilities of  million as of september   working capital consisted of current assets of  million less current liabilities of  million as of december    total capitalization includes longterm debt including the current portion and stockholders’ equity our principal sources of liquidity on a shortterm basis are cash and cash equivalents cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities we believe these sources will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs on a longterm basis our potential sources of liquidity also include raising capital through the issuance of debt andor equity the primary uses of liquidity include debt service requirements including voluntary debt repayments or redemptions funding working capital requirements funding acquisitions paying acquisition integration costs capital expenditures paying restructuring costs income tax payments including cost of repatriation and funding pension and other postretirement obligations cash and cash equivalents decreased during the first nine months of  mainly due to our voluntary redemptions of  million of our senior pik toggle notes largely offset by cash generated by our operations  as of september   approximately  of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the us  income taxes have been provided on foreign earnings such that there would be no significant tax cost to repatriate the portion of this cash that is not required to meet operational needs of our international subsidiaries   working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents and current portion of longterm debt decreased primarily due to higher accrued liability balances due to the timing of payments of interest and taxes and higher variable cash compensation costs as well as higher accounts payable balances due to improved management of payment terms these declines were offset partially by higher accounts receivable balances due to the timing of sales the net change in total capitalization during the nine months ended september   primarily reflected the redemptions of  million of our

activities during the nine months ended september   we generated  million of cash through operating activities compared to  million during the nine months ended september   the improvement was primarily due to higher adjusted operating income in the current year period as a result of the bns acquisition in addition we benefited from initiatives to improve working capital and the impact of lower variable cash compensation payments than in the prior year period cash paid for taxes was  million less for the nine months ended september   compared to the prior year period cash paid for interest was  million higher in the nine months ended september   than in the prior year period primarily as a result of the incremental debt incurred to finance the bns acquisition in connection with the voluntary redemptions of the senior pik toggle notes we paid redemption premiums of  million investing activities investment in property plant and equipment during the nine months ended september   was  million of which  million was related to capital spending to support the bns integration during the nine months ended september   investment in property plant and equipment was  million of which  million was related to capital spending to support the bns integration  the investment in property plant and equipment was primarily related to supporting improvements in manufacturing operations including expanding production capacity and investing in information technology including software developed for internal use   during the nine months ended september   we sold a facility that was no longer being utilized for  million during the nine months ended september   we received  million in net settlements for working capital pension and other adjustments related to the bns acquisition  we do not expect any additional material net settlements with te connectivity related to the bns acquisition also during the nine months ended september   we paid the final  million in purchase price payable related to the airvana acquisition   during the nine months ended september   we acquired the bns business and paid  million net of cash acquired using a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt financing activities during the nine months ended september   we voluntarily redeemed the remaining  million of our senior pik toggle notes we also made mandatory debt repayments of  million on the  term loan we may voluntarily repay debt or repurchase our senior notes if market conditions are favorable and the applicable indenture and the senior secured credit facilities permit such repayment or repurchase as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the remaining availability was approximately  million reflecting a borrowing base of  million reduced by  million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility in the third quarter of  we increased our capacity as additional domestic collateral resulting from the bns acquisition was added to the borrowing base during the nine months ended september   we received proceeds of  million and recognized  million of excess tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options also during the nine months ended september   employees surrendered  shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units which reduced cash flows by  million during the nine months ended september   we received proceeds of  million and recognized  million of excess tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options during the nine months ended september   we received  million from the issuance of the  notes which was used together with cash on hand to repay  million of our existing term loans in addition we issued  billion of  notes and borrowed  billion under the  term loan the proceeds from the  notes and the  term loan were used to fund a substantial portion of the bns acquisition in connection with these financing transactions and the amendment of our revolving credit facility we incurred  million of debt issuance costs offbalance sheet arrangements we are not party to any significant offbalance sheet arrangements except for operating leases  there have not been any material changes to our offbalance sheet arrangements during the nine months ended

financial statements included in our  annual report reconciliation of nongaap measures we believe that presenting certain nongaap financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance we further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business we also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors we believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors however our use of the terms nongaap adjusted operating income and nongaap adjusted ebitda may vary from that of others in our industry these financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to operating income loss net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with us gaap as measures of operating performance operating cash flows or liquidity we also believe presenting these nongaap results for the twelve months ended september   provides an additional tool for assessing our recent performance  such amounts are unaudited and are derived by subtracting the data for the nine months ended september   from the data for the year ended december   and then adding the data for the nine months ended september   although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes there is a limitation among other limitations on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio these ratios are based on financial measures similar to adjusted ebitda as presented below but also give pro forma effect to certain events including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions for the twelve months ended september   our pro forma adjusted ebitda as measured pursuant to indentures governing our notes was  million which included the impact of savings from announced cost reduction initiatives  million so that the impact of the cost    reduction initiatives are fully reflected in the twelvemonth period used in the calculation of the ratios  in additio n to limitations under these indentures our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants  we believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and senior secured credit facilities at september   the following tables
