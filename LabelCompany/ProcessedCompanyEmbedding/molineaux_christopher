reporter philadelphia business journal enlarge christopher molineaux pennsylvania bio a trade group representing life sciences companies throughout the state has boosted its membership in recent years by targeting clinical research organizations also known as contract research organizations cros and developing programs for that sector of the industry in  pennsylvania bio’s membership roster included two clinical research organizations enlarge christopher molineaux this year it has  cros among its  members many of which are based outside the state pennsylvania bio president christopher p molineaux talked about the region’s growing cros with philadelphia business journal senior reporter john george q what’s behind the growth in the number of cros in this region there are a couple of reasons big pharma has been pursuing ways to reduce expenses and derisk product development outsourcing nonstrategic functions allows the pharma companies to reduce overhead while still having access to these highly technical highly specialized services in some cases the pharma company turns to former employees who have formed cros because they know and trust the former employee it’s less costly for the pharma company which is no longer carrying the overhead and the pharma company is still able to access topquality resources who were trained in the pharma company’s labs this approach is also very beneficial for the enterprising scientist who can start his own business performing the same scientific work he performed within a pharma company while running his own organization and creating jobs q what does this mean for our region the emergence of these smaller cros or laboratory services organizations is an opportunity for southeastern pennsylvania to once again differentiate itself as the global hub of biopharmaceutical expertise as biopharma companies turn to an outsourced model for rd and this cro community continues to expand pennsylvania is uniquely suited to lead the way our region has the talent and the expertise due to decades of academic excellence in medical research and decades of global pharma presence q what is your association doing for cros pennsylvania bio has developed new programs and member benefits to appeal to the increasing cro community the association formed a cro advisory committee in  — with leaders from  large midsized and startup cros — to determine and help shape the most beneficial business and public policy environment for this growing sector patrick dentinger president and ceo of extonbased absorption systems chairs the committee
