reviewed may   via mobile we have been in timeshare for over  years had weeks in  places never had a problem have traded weeks successfully and enjoyed many vacations our weeks at powhatan plantation in williamsburg va were bought out by diamond resorts two years ago we were convinced by dr representatives that we should convert to points although we were reluctant we were persuaded it was the more modern way gave more options etc we compared it to moving from a land line to a smart phone all i can say is this we have paid over  in two years to dr and have  unused points to show for it the times we tried to use points we got nowhere we thought our powhatan weeks were now points oh no they are still weeks but we can convert them to points for a fee biggest biggest mistake of our lives we should have stayed with what we had because it had always worked we know points works for some people but we have paid a lot of money for something that is not working for us think twice stayed may

show tix etc we had to show our ids and credit card and we were taken on a shuttle to polo suites for the presentation my husband and i did our research on their strategies on our way there so we were prepared to turn down their offer from the start there were snacks and nonalcoholic beverages we had our own vacation consultant that we met with initially and then we went through an energetic presentation for the group at the end we met with our consultant again for a tour of the place of the areas we did see it looked nice think critically and do your research before you go so that you dont get sucked in we were offered several different deals by several different people but finally we got our gifts we considered the whole presentation experience to be a fun adventure but your mileage may vary we were also given a free vacation to be used  months in the future but there was so much fine print that i doubt well be using it stayed january  traveled as a couple helpful thank

for the stratosphere it stated we were going to be in a well appointed room i made reservations for  additional nights with a strip view when i checked in i asked if it would be possible to stay in the same room for the entire stay they said the room through diamond resorts was a standard room with a limited view and i would need to pay the upgrade charge of  a night with some deliberation we went ahead and upgraded to the strip view and paid the  already a little irritated we went to our room once we arrived i was absolutely disgusted nothing about our room said well appointed no fridge no coffee maker the room was tiny we were tripping over each other just to walk around the room the channel line up was pathetic no fan in the bathroom and the beds were terrible at  my feet hung off the end and i woke up with a backache after tossing and turning all night on future visits we will definitely not be staying at the stratosphere and at the presentation that we are required to attend on tuesday morning they are going to get a mouthful of how pathetic their sales pitch is so far stayed december  traveled with family helpful  thank cagillispie report ask cagillispie about diamond
