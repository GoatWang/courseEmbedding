comprises approximately  households              table of contents      competitive business conditions and the smaller reporting company’s competitive position in the industry and methods of competition   we believe that our competitors usually give people in the communities programming which is of negative impact and which does not engage them few channels cover the positive things that the community is doing to help the less fortunate or even to help themselves cable networks specialize in specific genres and usually have great overheads and liabilities to contend with in order to fulfill their programming agendas while meeting the demands of advertisers additionally most of the current news media networks show bias for one side or the other whether it is the liberal point of view or the conservative point of view our goal is to serve all sides of the equation with equal opportunity news and entertainment programming for all opinions and voices in each community that we reach   eosf covers and promotes uplifting and empowering content as well as promotion of proactive safety matters and public announcements in each market there are different needs in the community and the people and their issues have a right to be heard the essence of eosf network is to bring people together that is by them and for them   the use of our software technology provides eosf many solutions when it comes to attracting viewers to watch our tv stations live streaming programming smart device promotions andor to engage in its website portals that promote their eye on network content for example wwweyeonsouthfloridacom delivers simultaneous live streaming in between live events and makes it possible for vast amounts of traffic to be generated long after the events are archived on the websites   eosf is currently positioned in south florida as a leader in its genre as we continue to be the voice of the people giving them back what they want and need in their communities the eye on brand will continue to offer nonprofit organizations and their sponsored advertisers a medium from which to promote their production events sponsored brands can broaden their audience especially during live streaming events which are open to hundreds of millions of viewers from the world wide web news like this does not get around to mainstream media but at eosf it does matter and it will always matter because it is what we do we have no direct competition with the type of alternative programming we produce benefiting the community and nonprofit organizations as a matter of fact other main stream media networks have solicited us to rebroadcast our content on their networks because they now started to see the importance of what we are doing and more important how the community has reacted   our strategy is to be a resource for other media networks to continue to approach our organization as a source of content for their programming we will accomplish this by making sure that we are on the cutting edge of communication community news and entertainment and new technology our platform is designed to give the advertisers multiple ways and methods to broadcast their commercial messages and promote their brands to a wide audience with ease and efficiency which translates into a time saving and more cost efficient method of producing and distributing commercial advertising and content to all the targeted people places and even things which will equate to a better roi   patents trademarks licenses franchises concessions royalty agreements or labor contracts including duration   as eosf develops its programming property portfolio management fully intends to license and develop strategic relationships with affiliate networks and or satellite cable networks that desire to participate in licensing eosf’s slate of original programming if our marketing campaigns are successful we will be able to offer licensing of our trademarked and copyright protected proprietary works to include new and innovative communication platforms designed to distribute content by way of versatile and vertically integrated mediums as described herein as a part of this business plan to other networks and communication and technology service providers worldwide said proprietary works will be made available to other businesses and as such the fees and licensing percentages will greatly increase our profitability              table of contents      number of total employees and number of fulltime employees   at this time the company has five parttime contracted employees   how long can we satisfy our cash requirements and will we need to raise additional funds in the next  months   our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations and client base we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company’s securities we would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by regulation d rule  or conduct a private offering under section a of the securities act of    in the event we raise additional capital we will be able to implement our expansion in accordance with our business plan we anticipate that we will use the funds raised to fund marketing activities and working capital our failure to market and promote our services will harm our business and future financial performance if we are unable to expand our operations within the next twelve months we will likely see a decrease in the ability of increasing our revenues we cannot guarantee that additional funding will be available on favorable terms if at all if adequate funds are not available then we may not be able to expand our operations if adequate funds are not available we believe that our officers and directors will contribute funds to pay for some of our expenses our director has verbally agreed to continue to fund our operations as needed over the next  months until cash flows are sufficient to sustain operations pursuant to the agreement our ceo has agreed to only the return of his capital with no interest or other consideration thus far there has not been any need for funds beyond the  in loans previously provided to the company by our ceo jack namer in the event we require additional funding in the form of loans from our ceo we do not know whether we will issue stock for the loans or whether we will merely prepare and sign promissory notes   the implementation of our business strategy is estimated to take approximately  months currently we have only a few paying clients some of our clients currently include hard rock hotel  casino autonation florida metro rail fort lauderdale chamber of commerce shino bay dermatology delvecchio pizza and universal insurance however our ceo has been involved in the television media industry for many years and has commenced making initial contact with his previous associates once we are able to secure additional funding implementation of our business strategy will begin immediately we anticipate that it will take  days to be in a stage of full operational activity to gain additional clients the major parts of the strategy to be immediately implemented will be the sales and marketing and office equipment and human resource procurement   our lack of revenues has affected the company directly without a strong or known market demand it was considered a risk to expand in any new geographical areas since there was realistic probability that costs would not be recovered upon completion and sales generated   summary of product research and development   we are not currently nor do we anticipate in the future to be conducting any research

directed to the site when they search for information regarding business consulting finally the company’s web address will be featured on all printed materials including advertisements stationary etc   strategic alliances   we will gain a significant amount of leads through developing strategic alliance relationships with companies offering complimentary services and products to the small to
