optimism regarding potential tax reform deregulation and fiscal stimulus favorable fourthquarter earnings reports and improving economic data also helped market conditions howev er weakened in march oil prices started to slide pressuring returns in energy the largest sector weighting in the bofa merrill lynch us high yield index the index in addition concern about an accelerated timetable for interest rate hikes sa pped investors appetite for risk undermining demand concurrently new highyield bond issuance surged as refinancings rose ahead of further interestrate increases or possible tax changes affecting the deductibility of interest expenses the federal r eserves feds march  decision to inch its key target rate higher had little impact on high yield but the asset class did see inflows pick up as expectations for the pace of future rate increases eased this tailwind was somewhat offset by republica ns inability to repeal and replace the affordable care act raising questions about when and if the new administration would be able to pass muchanticipated tax reform and meaningful fiscal stimulus highyield bond fundamentals continued to improve as evidenced by better revenue and earnings growth numbers corporate leverage modestly decreased for the second consecutive quarter due to improved earnings and interest coverage a measure of highyiel d issuers ability to service their debt obligations the trailing month default rate declined to  at quarter end down from  at the start of the year due to the fact that q s elevated defaults in the energy and metalsmining sectors have now rolled off the trailing month period the default rate exenergy and metalsmining issuers is currently  average yields on highyield bonds tightened to  and prices modestly improved for the three months ended march   the index returned  beating the  gain of the bloomberg barclays us aggregate bond index but lagging the  return of the sp  index within the index lowerquality and longerdurati on issues posted the strongest gains performance summary  eaton vance income fund of boston the fund posted a modest gain at net asset value for the quarter that was slightly behind the return of the index the funds higherquality lowervolatility bias notably in the ccc and brated segments and the energy sector protected the fund in march but hindered performance for the quarter as lowerquality issues outperformed duration positioning hampered performance largely because of the funds overweight in shorterduration issues which lagged longerduration bonds and credit selection in the twoto fiveyear duration segment by contrast the fund benefited from a small equity position mostly acquired through restructuring and an underweight in the weakerperforming bb category credit selection was positive in the services diversified financial services air transportation and chemicals segments which generally benefited from expectations of improved economic growth historical

inception  expense ratio  contributors  factors contributing to the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter a small postrestructuring equity position benefited performance most an underweight in the weakerperforming bb segment also had a positive impact credit selection and an overweight in the services segment further benefited performance led by an overweight in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company that returned over  for the quarter credit selection in the air transportation diversified financial services and chemicals categories positively affected fund performance top individual contributors included overweights in bonds issued by a commercial equipment rental company an aircra ft leasing operation a rebounding corporate jet charter operation and a producer of titanium dioxide detractors  factors detracting from the funds relative performance compared to the index during the quarter credit selection in the ccc and brated segments hurt largely because the fund favored higherquality less volatile bonds that lagged lowerquality issues credit selection among two to fiveyear duration bonds along with an overweight in securities with durations of two years or less detracted from fund performance credit selection and relative weighting in telecommunications and retail further detracted from fund performance the funds quality bias also hindered performance in energy investment outlook and fund positioning  we think the backdrop for highyield bonds remains supportive going forward we expect modest economic growth to result in relatively stable bond prices while shortterm interest rates will likely increase we dont think the economy will overheat to t he point where the fed becomes overly aggressive what is less clear is when or if proposed progrowth initiatives will be enacted and what impact that will have on investment markets some of the governments proposed initiatives if approved could have a positive effect on highyield bonds for example if the tax deductibility of corporate interest expense is no longer allowed that could on the margin lead to less new issuance i n highyield at the same time a lower tax rate on interest income earned by highincome filers could boost demand for high yield the implementation of tax reform or infrastructure spending plans could also help extend the duration of the us economic recovery in turn aiding highyield fundamentals and driving down default rates we recognize however that there also are potential headwinds for the asset class volatility could be elevated especially given uncertainty over the republicans ability to deliver on tax reform and fiscal stimulus a choppy market may dampen demand f or highyield bonds disappointing progress in washington or projected corporate earnings reports also could cause a stock market decline that could pressure highyield bond returns additionally if opec organization of the petroleum exporting countrie s doesnt follow through on its planned production cuts oil prices could pull back further hurting the energy sectorgiven relatively high valuations on highyield bonds and the potential for a pickup in volatility weve kept the fund conserv atively positioned maintaining a shorter duration and higherquality bias than the index by employing this strategy aimed at protecting the funds downside and minimizing volatility we believe we can stay ahead of the index in market declines and capt ure much of the upside in rallies which would help drive longterm relative performance at period end the funds average duration was  years compared to the indexs duration of  years in addition the funds biggest credit concentration was in brated bonds which generally have less duration lower duration usually means bond prices decline less as credit spreads widen at periodend the fund had a small allocation to the higherquality splitrated bbbbb segment and in the ccc and b rated segments representing a bias toward less volatile issues in the energy sector weve continued to favor higherquality lowercos t producers that in our view are less susceptible to price volatility during the quarter we added to some of our core exploration and production names and took advantage of opportunities in energy services our energy stake at quarter end was roughly in line with the sectors approximately  weight in the index in healthcare the second largest sector in the fund we had a bias toward bonds issued by healthcare services providers and companies that serve to reduce cost such as contract research organizations cros the fund was underweight hospital bonds which could be vulnerable to a repeal of the affordable care act and had a shorter duration focus in the pharmaceutical
