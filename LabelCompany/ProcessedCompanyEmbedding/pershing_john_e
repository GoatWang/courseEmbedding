management shakeup antoine gara sep    pm edt updated from  am to include valence group comments and share prices new york  thestreet  air products  apd will replace its ceo john e mcglade in  and elect three new independent directors to its board of directors after bill ackman of pershing square capital management took a large stake in the chemicals manufacturer and pressed for change the management and board shakeup at air products is ackmans first successful activist move since he resigned from jc penneys  jcp board of directors in august and sold pershings stake in the struggling retail chain for a loss of more then half a billion dollars ackmans air products campaign also comes as the hedgie continues to press a  billion short position in herbalife  hlf that has drawn criticism from peers such as carl icahn of icahn associates and dan loeb of third point capital management the unsuccessful campaign to turn jc penney around and a controversial short position in herbalife has caused some in the media to treat ackman as a spectacle and question whether he has lost his clout on wall street ackmans involvement in the shakeup at air products however indicates that he still holds significant influence as an activist investor and has the ability to impact change on large corporations while we can debate whether ackmans authority as an activist was tarnished after his jc penney and herbalife setbacks air products proves that he still wields clout alex khutorsky managing director of the valence group an ma advisory investment bank focused on the chemical industry said in an email the avoidance of a noisy fight should satisfy shareholders who have benefited from ackmans investment in the firm and for the moment appease ackman he added pershing square built an over  billion stake in air products about  of the companys outstanding shares and advocated for management and board change after the company fell short on targets on its strategic initiative to grow revenue to  billion by  air products currently has a market capitalization of over  billion and the companys over  yeartodate stock gain largely influenced by ackmans investment is a turn from a spell of underperformance pershing square also appears to have had an influence in change atop other prominent corporations this year earlier in  dow jones industrial average component procter  gamble  pg replaced its ceo with ag lafley in a move cheered on by ackman after pershing took a large stake in the consumer products giant air products said in a thursday statement that the retirement of current ceo john e mcglade in  taken with its board change will ensure that the company has appropriate experience and expertise to deliver longterm value for shareholders we invested in air products because it is a great business in an industry with excellent longterm prospects in recent weeks we have been delighted to get to know john and the rest of the board working with them on their
