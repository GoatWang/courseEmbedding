operate in many industries our proposed revenue streams we expect to come from the hyperlocal marketing space our proposed primary source of revenue we expect will come from local small businesses were fighting for their marketing dollars in a competitive market dominated by traditional advertisements such as print  radio and upcoming digital advertisement from google ads microsoftbing advertising foursquare and waze other major players in the hyperlocal space are groupon livingsocial yelp and pirq by having members set their preferences they can receive promos without the need of searching in essence savmobi preempts searching making our marketing efforts a step ahead of search advertisement since vendors have set the distance to send their promos and members optin to preferences the promos that members receive have high relevancy savmobi is not reliant on checkins or maps even though we have similar features the checkin model gives consumers discounts and offers after they intended to visit that business users of foursquare a social checkin network primarily use the service to notify their friends of their current location foursquare is experimenting with ways to monetize their business model and enhance the business experience through promotions their current efforts involve methods of exploration and discovery waze created a traffic and navigation app that allows businesses to advertise by pinning their location on maps waze is promoting to businesses that they will reach a community of millions of drivers and everyday commuters however waze users are primarily looking for the best route to their intended location not for pins on a map daily deal sites such as groupon and livingsocial transformed the hyperlocal market they brought local vendors new customers through a digital option that had no upfront costs and they changed consumer perception of redeeming coupons although a revolutionary concept the sustainability of daily deals has not been proven businesses that participate in daily deals have mixed experiences including loss of profit overwhelming peak traffic and inconsistent results yelp and pirq are expected to be our biggest competitors once our proposed products are launched yelp is a local directory service with social networking and user reviews in the first quarter of  they had more than  million unique visitors to their website yelpcom their primary source of revenue comes from local business advertising businesses may advertise with yelp for preferred search result placement and extra listing features the advertising fee may include an individualized message video and photo slide show onto their listing as well as analytic reports businesses that advertise with yelp pay to be at preferred locations on a search page hoping that consumers will see their listing and come to their location although that is a strong message savmobi goes a step further by putting a more enticing message in front of our members a discount or offer pirqs business model is similar to our business model theyve built an app that displays businesses in the area and the discount that is offered users look for the business and discount theyd like enter the business location and scan a microsoft tag similar to a qr code to receive their discount pirq initially launched as a restaurant deals app they are currently trying to expand to other industries and services after being in operations for  years they are still positioned as a restaurant deals app in the eyes of businesses and consumers they operate nationwide there are many competitors that exist this is a clear indication on the growth and potential of the hyperlocal market although our competitors share traits and similarities to us savmobi intends to build from the ground up to become a preferred vendor platform provided that attracts consumers to local businesses what distinguishes our proposed companys software are features that are unique and are not included in our competitors software and apps these included firstly our proposed members are able to set their preferences and then receive promos via their smartphones without the need of a general search on the web in essence savmobi preempts searching making our marketing efforts a step ahead of our competitors broad general search advertisements secondly we also allow our proposed vendors to provide set distances to send their promos and with the members optin preferences the promos the members receive as per their preferences have a high relevancy this allows vendors to target consumers within a specific neighborhood if they so choose company description savmobi technology inc was formed in the state of nevada as a forprofit company on march   we

their business in their quarterly reports issued to shareholders it also requires entitywide disclosures about the products and services the entity provides the material countries in which it holds assets and reports revenues and its major customers   comprehensive loss   “reporting comprehensive income” establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive loss and its components in the financial statements as at november   the company has no items that represent a comprehensive loss and therefore has not included a schedule of comprehensive loss in the financial statements   use of estimates and assumptions   preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period accordingly actual results could differ from those estimates                  note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   cash and cash equivalents   for purposes of the

determined and disclosed otherwise only available information pertinent to fair value has been disclosed   loss per common share   the basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the year the diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net income loss available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity diluted earnings loss per share are the same as basic earnings loss per share due to the lack of dilutive items in the company   income taxes   the company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances and tax loss carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled the

the company follows asc  stock compensation which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services with a primary focus on
