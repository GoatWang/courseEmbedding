advertisement supported by home  garden  cuttings clearing the view by anne raveroct   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story pottersville nj  when janet mavec married wayne nordberg  years ago she also married a acre farm with a mishmash of buildings including an early s farmhouse and two postandbeam barnsthese seemed timeless unlike the s sears kit house with its mildewed rooms that invited demolition and the squarefoot contemporary  built by mr nordberg and his wife at the time olivia who died before it was finished  struck her as out of scale i hate this house ms mavec said last month but well what was i going to domr nordberg a partner in a small manhattan investment firm agreed that the house had gotten away from him it was supposed to be a plain shaker kind of structure he said but it morphed into a modern design that got a lot bigger and more expensivebut both loved the land for mr nordberg who grew up on a farm  miles from here it had the topography that he had known since childhood his children sam  and anna  had spent their summers swimming in the springfed pond in winter they had sledded on the fiveacre hayfield that rises beyond the old barns advertisement continue reading the main story the potential was here to make this place so beautiful said ms mavec  but i couldnt figure out how to clean it up it needed editing continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story then she came upon the book mirrors of paradise the gardens of fernando caruncho by guy cooper and gordon taylor monacelli  and it struck her like some kind of oracle she stared at the books images of gardens  waves of clipped evergreens labyrinths quiet flat pools of water  and saw the answer in this classical love of order i wanted someone with a pure sensibility who would come to this place with an open mind she saidso she and anna accompanied mr nordberg to spain where he had business in madrid they paid a visit to mr carunchos home on the outskirts of the city it was early july  and very hotit felt like  degrees ms mavec said but mr carunchos strippeddown contemporary house with its colored walls and sculptured evergreens and reflections of sky in shallow pools created this cool quality a great calm she saidthe personal chemistry was right too and mr caruncho visited bird haven farm as it is called the next springhe said he had a powerful feeling as he approached the old farm he was struck by the contrast between deep forests and rolling open fields it reminded me of a medieval place a virgin site where nature is stronger than man mr caruncho wrote by email the forest was amazing but so were the clear spaces and it was the clear spaces that i wanted to relate to the architecturehe connected the whole landscape with the geometry of the circle and the ellipse first he envisioned a quiet circular reflecting pool in front of the original stone farmhouse as a kind of gathering pointhe also imagined two great intersecting circles of the same diameter one centered on the buildings and orchard the other marking the hayfield these great circles would be marked by bollards placed  feet apart in the end the reflecting pool was built but the intersecting circles were not advertisement continue reading the main story both wayne and i loved the concept but it was impractical ms mavec said for one thing the bollards would have had to be lifted each time the farmer came to mowso mr caruncho reimagined the field as one great ellipse with  native trees just like those in the woods marking the curves ms mavec did the math  by  trees and said i dont think so besides mr nordberg said they couldnt give up that much of their hayfield which is part of an agricultural easement that drastically reduces their taxesbut they did hire a forester to clear out a footwide swath of trees from the edges of the forest they also removed two hedgerows that had divided the field into three sectionsnow that elliptical field rises to the north of the farm with a magical presence tempering mr carunchos bold vision with reality his american clients have begun to plant native hemlock and pine as well as some specimen trees like blue atlas cedar and serbian spruce to mark the curves of the ellipsemr caruncho had other ideas like a folly at the top of the field and a massive earth mound a kind of dock raised  to  feet made from compacted soil as he described it with a belvedere on top built on the southwest slope of the property but mr nordberg and ms mavec would have none of it this was not the south of france or even the hamptonsit didnt fit with what we wanted to retain which was the feeling of the colonial farm mr nordberg said his concept of the medieval village was brilliant because its all about the land the topography and the buildingsaside from its history as a subsistence farm bird haven farm was once owned by harriet stratemeyer adams who carried on the childrens literature syndicate started by her father edward stratemeyer the syndicate used ghostwriters to produce adventure stories like the nancy drew and hardy boys series mrs adams took a personal interest in nancy drew and wrote many of those mysteries herself her ghost is on the second floor ms mavec said so if you have writers block you can go up there and talk to hermrs adams built elaborate gardens edged with boxwood on the west side of the house and dug the springfed pond so beautifully sited at the base of the hilly field she also put together the sears kit house and gave the whole place its affectionate name advertisement continue reading the main story but it was ms mavec who asked manuel fernandezcasteleiro and jeff parsons the new york architects to design the airy pond house that sits like a dragonfly over the water and later the simple guest house that replaced the sears house mr fernandezcasteleiro who was born in cuba and educated in puerto rico served as translator for the collaboration it has been the first time in my professional career that i have sold a master plan without getting involved in the construction mr caruncho wrotelast month mr nordberg stood at the top of the field looking down at a long stone wall that mr caruncho suggested be built as the northern edge of the collection of buildings thats the edge of the medieval village he saidbehind the wall a riot of vegetables and flowers spilled over long rectangular beds edged with little boxwoods bean vines wound up tall metal trellises a more formal more meditative garden of lavender santolina and sedum bloomed in the old barnyard these inner gardens designed by lisa stamm a new york landscape designer are contained by a curving stone wall designed by her architect husband dale booherbeyond those stone walls the stone farmhouse seemed to float behind a green sea of boxwoods and the perfectly round reflecting pool glimmered in a courtyard of white gravel now i cant imagine what this village would be without it ms mavec said as jewels her yearold terrier toddled up for a drink it would be so boringnow the central courtyard with its pool and boxwoods draws attention away from the bulk of the familys main house which ms mavec finds so hard to love  although she has cleared it of clutter and toned its colors to grays and buffs so that now the brilliant colors of her cut flowers are the stars of the great quiet roomsthe main house is now also balanced by the spare contemporary house that mr fernandezcasteleiro and mr parsons placed facingthe orchard which seems to bring the trees right up to its floortoceiling windows its glass front door is dead center on the wide grassy path that cuts through the center of the grid of two dozen apple trees all perfectly pruned and when youre in the bathtub ms mavec said nodding towards the second floor you could almost reach out and pick an applemr bergs children had a cider party with their friends one recent weekend anna stays in the orchard house sam sleeps upstairs in the old stone farmhouse the place has really come alive again the way it was when they were growing up mr nordberg saidmaybe thats because everything is connected now by mr carunchos ancient geometry continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think
