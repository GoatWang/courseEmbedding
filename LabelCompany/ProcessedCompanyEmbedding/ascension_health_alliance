organization and announced plans to expand healthcare manufacturers and distributors must prepare to serve this growing type of integrated national delivery network table of contents news analysis event analysis recommendations recommended reading news analysis event on  march  ascension health alliance a us catholic nonprofit health system which generated about  billion in revenue in  announced that it had signed a memorandum of understanding for the daughters of charity health system dchs to become part of the ascension health alliance dchs is a health system operating  sites including six hospitals in coastal california formed a group purchasing organization gpo service that will be provided through the resource and supply management group a subsidiary of ascension health alliance analysis ascension health alliance’s expansion and creation of its own gpo that will likely leverage large committed volume contracts continues the consolidation of demand that we forecast in predicts  supply chain for healthcare and life sciences  regional and national health systems such as ascension health alliance continue to consolidate and gpo services offered by an integrated delivery network idn are increasing ascension health alliance will expand its footprint nationally and continue to take advantage of volumes to lower costs this expansion in the scale and scope of the supply chain will likely push manufacturers to become even more effective in endtoend supply chain planning to differentiate their capabilities from those of their competitors ascension health alliance’s further expansion into geographically dispersed markets presents an opportunity for national distributors that support multiple areas effectively regional consolidated service centers may work in certain geographies but ascension health alliance is likely to continue to pressure large distributors to manage complexity gartner expects that the national leverage of idns such as ascension health alliance will lead distributors to continue improving collaboration and to support standardization and visibility across the endtoend value chain recommendations life sciences manufacturers and service providers prepare for another round of negotiations as ascension health alliance aggregates demand and commits to a minimum volume of business calculate the value of committed volume contracts vs broader traditional gpo contracts and structure the agreement accordingly develop strategies to address the needs of a new breed of customer that commits to buying volumes across regions develop a more efficient endtoend supply chain to serve these large progressive customers profitably use service standardization and a focus on patient outcomes along with lower endtoend product and service costs to drive comprehensive value for idns such as ascension health alliance consider building an accountspecific profitandloss statement to drive value beyond contract price for large idngpo combinations that are increasing their reach distributors develop offerings in response to the expected increase in pressure from ascension health alliance and other large idns with expanding sourcing capabilities for advanced relationships that support standardization greater endtoend visibility and lower delivered costs build capabilities that balance service with delivered cost at the closest point of supply to patient care idns consider leveraging the committed volume of powerhouses such as ascension health alliance or other regional sourcing initiatives to help drive down costs if you are a large idn with unique supply chain capabilities and brand recognition consider using your supply chain strengths to create marketable programs for other idns as a revenue generator recommended
