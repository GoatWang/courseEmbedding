healthsouth for second novavision therapy product tweet   am boca raton florida june   prnewswire  vycor medical inc vycor otcqb vyco a provider of innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions announced that it has entered into an agreement with healthsouth corporation hls to make available its neuroeyecoach professional center therapy program to participating healthsouth hospitals following a month trial of the therapy in two healthsouth locationsneuroeyecoach is novavisions eye movement compensation therapy for those patients who have suffered a cerebral visual field disorder as a result of a stroke or brain injury and is designed to improve a patients ability to scan their environment more efficiently the program is based on several decades of scientific research pioneered by professor josef zihl at the max planck institute in munich that has been the subject of numerous clinical studies participating healthsouth hospitals will use the program to treat patients while in their care in contrast to other clinicbased saccadic programs neuroeyecoach is a fullcourse therapy dedicated to cerebral visual field disorders and can be continued by the patient in their home environmentthis agreement follows the approval by healthsouth in late  to make available its vidit diagnostic to their hospital network and novavision is installing devices into this network the novavision vidit is the diagnostic component of the companys vision restoration therapy vrt and is used to perform highresolution visual field tests to screen for central visual field deficits commonly associated with stroke or brain injury the ability for health south physicians to be able to quickly identify visual disorders through the effective screening program is highlighted by the fact that approximately onethird of stroke or other brain injury patients suffer from a neurologically induced visual disorder and if this deficit goes undetected it may adversely impact other rehabilitation modalities early detection and treatment are critical steps towards improving overall patient care a key objective of healthsouth once diagnosed patients are able to be treated inclinic with neuroeyecoach and referred to novavision for treatment following discharge at home using vrt which is the only fda cleared clinically supported therapy targeted at the restoration of lost vision resulting from neurological brain damage such as that resulting from strokehealthsouth wwwhealthsouthcom is one of the largest providers of postacute healthcare services in the us these two agreements therefore provide novavision with a source of installation and rental income but equally as important is a potentially large source of patients most stroke patients will touch a rehabilitation center at some point and healthsouth is the largest network of stroke rehabilitation hospitals in the usthis announcement follows novavisions press release in march that it had completed development of vrt  reengineering the therapy to be internetdelivered and streamlining business process to enable a significant reduction in cost to the patient novavision will provide vrt and neuroeyecoach in one therapy suite novavision will very shortly be commencing accepting patients with the new therapy suite which is considered by management to be the most affordable clinically supported comprehensive

interviews  asian healthcare management knowledge bank interviews vycor medical inc peter zachariou   ceo our core philosophy is to bring to market devices and therapies that address significant needs across multiple disciplines by working directly with and through the best minds in the healthcare community from around the world our products and services are designed to advance the health and well being of people worldwide  whats the core philosophy of vycor medical in designing developing and delivering the neurosurgical and neurotherapeutic solutions our core philosophy is to bring to market devices and therapies that address significant needs across multiple disciplines by working directly with and through the best minds in the healthcare community from around the world our products and services are designed to advance the health and well being of people worldwide all our products and therapies are evidence based what i mean by that is that they are supported by rigorous clinical data they are designed to be minimally invasive and have regulatory clearances such as fda and ce marking   what has vycor medical got to offer for patients suffering from vision loss due to neurological trauma substantial numbers of americans therefore suffer from a visual disability resulting from neurological brain damage the impact on their daily lives is dramatic and is the difference between a person being able to be home alone cross the road unaided drive shop or read novavisions portfolio of therapies is specifically targeted to help these people to both restore and compensate for this type of vision disability our therapies are designed to be done in the comfort of the patients home however we also have clinic based professional models the benefits of the products can best be understood by reading the many testimonials we have we recently had one of our patients carole give her life changing experience on several radio stations she is one of many patients that were told by their physician that there was nothing that could be done for them and were even sceptical of our therapy but thankfully she never gave up hope and after her  month treatment she regained   of her vision    what are vycor medicals recent advances in manufacturing computerbased light stimulation therapies we have recently launched our web deliverable therapies consisting of both our lead vision restoration therapy and in the same therapy suite we also have our newly developed neuroeyecoach compensation therapy that complements our vrt restoration aims at improving visual sensitivity within the blind area by repeated stimulation allowing patients to detect objects within the blind field examples of this type of therapy include novavision’s vision restoration therapy vrt which is the only fda cleared therapy to our knowledge targeted at the restoration of lost vision from brain damage such as that resulting from stroke compensation patients learn to direct their gaze towards the affected area bringing previously unseen objects into sight thereby allowing the patient to make the most of their remaining vision neuroeyecoach is an example of this type of therapy  what is the significance of the product novavision web deliverable therapy suite the new web deliverable therapy suite that has just been launched is priced at  that is affordable to the masses we believe this is the most affordable clinically supported comprehensive therapy suite available on the market to address visual disorders from neurological brain damage   how does vycor medical strive to produce robust yet affordable solutions for neurologically induced visual disorders the first point to note is that everything we do is rigorously clinically supported we achieve this by working closely with our worldclass scientific advisors and other physicians familiar with our products once the product is agreed we have then been focused on how to deliver that product at the lowest cost to the patient in this case through the internet delivery we have managed to largely eliminate the hardware costs otherwise inherent and pass on those cost savings to the patients   how did vycor gain the trust of healthcare providers for ensuring safety and precision with the use of its medical devices firstly our products are fda cleared this means that they have gone through a substantial development program carefully controlled by vycor’s robust quality systems that are then maintained to ensure safety and efficacy monitoring of our products secondly both of our businesses have a wealth of clinical data that supports our products vrt has over  clinical studies neuroeyecoach is supported by  clinical studies and our vbas has  peer reviewed papers demonstrating its superiority  how does vycor work to collaborate with novavision in developing future products just to be clear i assume you are asking how management of vycor interacts with novavision in their new product development management evaluates all ideas that originate from novavision its scientific advisors or outside physicians to try and identify potential new products and product extensions we typically work with direct scientific input as well as a dedicated development team  what does the recent healthsouthvycor agreement mean to patients in the network hospitals healthsouth trialed both our vidit diagnostic product and neuroeyecoach therapy center model product for many months in several sites and collected feedback on the basis of the feedback healthsouth approved our products to be made available in their network we have placed vidit and neuroeyecoach products with several healthsouth hospitals and are now actively marketing them through the healthsouth network the significance of this strategy is that most patients who have suffered a stroke or significant traumatic brain injury will touch a rehab center as an inpatient or outpatient at some time and that is the universe of patients that are eligible for our therapies looking beyond healthsouth there are other rehabilitation chains in the us which also may be interested in providing more focused vision rehabilitation treatments novavision stands ready to service those other chains also  with an estimated  billion market potential for novavision’s therapies in the us and europe what are your plans for the emerging markets we have just launched this product offering so initially it makes sense for us to focus our efforts on the areas where we have a physical presence namely the us and europe which as you say are large opportunities in their own right we have patent protection in a number of emerging markets and will be focusing in on those markets in due course  what are the challenges that vycor medical aims to solve for the medical community under your leadership in the coming years to become the standard of care for the markets we are currently addressing and to broaden the areas of focus into new related areas our neurosurgical division currently provides a solution for retraction of brain tissue and access to surgical sites in the brain however we have k clearance for spine and we see potential to provide solutions for retraction of delicate tissue and access to surgical sites elsewhere in the body we intend to make novavision the standard of care for vision loss from stroke or brain injury but also use the great delivery platform we have now built to provide therapies for other issues suffered by these patients such as reading and cognitive

september   prnewswire  vycor medical inc vycor otcqb vyco a provider of innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions will introduce its viewsite™ brain access system vbas product line extension and prototypes at the  congress of neurological surgeons cns annual meeting the event will be held at ernest n morial convention center in new orleans september   attendees may visit the companys booth  to learn about its two new viewsite tc model devices that are half the diameter of vbas smallest devices the devices were developed in close collaboration with a leading neurosurgeon who identified a need for a much smaller vbas than those currently available to allow less invasive surgery yet still enable the use of instruments such as endoscopes the smaller size also enables minimally invasive approaches to areas where existing retractors are too potentially invasive such as the ventricles the company expects the devices to be commercially available in the fourth quarter of this year peter zachariou ceo of vycor commented the vbas product line extension allows us to better address underserved neurosurgical needs in the market and is consistent with our stated objective of adding new product variations to our core vbas product line given the devices extremely small dimensions and smooth shape we believe the product features represent a significant step forward in minimally invasive brain access and retraction we see our two new devices helping us address an estimated  procedures in the us which were previously unaddressable by vycors existing vbas product line vycor will also showcase at its booth a finalized premanufacturing prototype of a set of four vbas devices designed to be integrated with selected image guided systems igs management strongly believes that the existing vbas rigid structure lends itself well to being incorporated into the increasing trend of igs surgery the products being displayed were developed in conjunction with input from both a leading neurosurgeon and a strategic company that is a leader in the image guidance space the company plans to launch the products in the second half of  in addition neurosurgeons from the department of neurological surgery weill cornell medical college new yorkpresbyterian hospital new york will discuss at the vycor booth the clinical advantages of using vbas management believes that continued high quality clinical data supporting the superiority and benefits of its vbas product line over traditional retractors will help accelerate its adoption and help make it the future standard of care the vbas was selected to be on the cover of the march edition of the prestigious journal of neurosurgery jns founded in  the journal of neurosurgery is recognized by neurosurgeons and related medical specialists worldwide for its authoritative and cuttingedge clinical articles laboratory research papers case reports literature reviews technical notes book
