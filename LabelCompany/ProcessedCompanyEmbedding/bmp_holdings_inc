fitness and yoga industry is highly competitive in general although our targeted marketplace is the northeast region where we compete primarily with “mom and pop” exercise and fitness facilities which are typically comprised of smaller family or individually owned and operated centers we may have to compete in the future against larger competitors that have greater financial resources and name recognition than we have we anticipate facing a high level of competition when opening new facilities for customers securing prime leasehold locations where we wish to open our fitness and yoga centers and attracting and retaining qualified employees many aspects of our business model are not proprietary and if they prove successful may be replicated by others we cannot prevent such competitors from entering the markets in which we seek to open new centers in addition we face competition for our onsite yoga sessions and classes from retail consumer outlet products such as streaming services through the internet yoga video dvd’s and television channel programs consumers can purchase yoga instructional videos and audio products online from national retailers such as amazoncom yogaorg and yogaoutletcom as well as through the websites of nationally known yoga instructors such as bryan kest shiva rea baron baptiste and rodney yee in fact we offer for sale yoga audio products via download through our website wwwbuddimatyogacom which sales are diminimus and represent a nonmaterial portion of our sales revenue moreover we believe that these retail yoga outlet products attract a different and more costconscious consumer than those who attend live instructorled onsite classes and sessions such as offered at our ridgefield connecticut facility accordingly we do not anticipate that these retail consumer outlet products will represent any material competition or risk to our classroom oriented yoga business  our primary competition is other yoga and fitness studios within the fitness and wellness industry there is competition for these services in the geographic area in which we hope to expand we have not undertaken an indepth evaluation of the company’s
