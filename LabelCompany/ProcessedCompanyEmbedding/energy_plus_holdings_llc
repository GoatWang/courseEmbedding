is a fraud they wrap customers up with a special hook offers like free miles or save on state tax and free points with an advertising hint that you are going to save money once you bite because you

billing error or they over looked it second they gauge you on the cost of your electric you buy from them they tell you they are buying at market prices but you will see you bill only go up on the average of  or even more by the time you realize what is going on and call to cancel they tell you it takes a billing cycle to switch back and steal more of your money i was with them for almost a year until i paid attention to what was happening they are stealing from ny customers and the attorney general needs to get involved i plan on going after this company on my own and am in the process of collecting customer bills to put together a class action lawsuit i have been posting on message boards and there are hundreds of upset customers who feel there money was stolen also the best part is when you call energy plus holdings to complain and let them know you want your money back and accuse them they will issue a refund immediately to keep you quite they are praying on people who wont pay attention or are embarrassed to fight them and are making millions at the expense of energy customers who were duped i have written certified letters to all the energy companies they are working with i have also notified jet blue upromise and marriot rewards among others to let them all know that energy plus holdings is using there name in a well planned fraud to deceit there long time loyal

the creation of  wind power one of the cleanest forms of electricity available for about a penny more per kilowatt hour green option customers reduce the nation’s dependence on conventional electricity generated by fossil fuels – while earning their choice of rewards how does the green option work every kilowatthour of electricity our green option customers use counts toward the purchase of renewable energy certificates recs  the “currency” of renewable electricity production in the united states one rec represents proof that one megawatthour of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy source what is a rec once renewable electricity such as wind power is fed into the electric grid it’s not possible to separate it from other sources of electricity so a credit rec is created as a way to account for – and encourage – green energy’s contribution to the grid recs are sold separately and only one certificate may be issued for each unit of renewable electricity produced the recs purchased by energy plus support  windgenerated power am i signing up to get green electricity sent to my home no you will continue to receive electricity the same way but when you sign up for the green option we will purchase renewable energy certificates recs produced by wind power generation facilities located in the united states to match  of your electricity usage are energy credits a substitute for conservation no the best way to reduce energy consumption is to use less energy energy credits are just one tool that encourages the creation of smarter

indicative of all regions right now many of our customers in ny and ct are receiving rates lower than their local utility and our competitors • the length of time it takes to return back to the utility is completely governed by the utility’s rules we submit all cancelations immediately and the utility informs us as to when the cancellation will take place in this instance we would encourage you to call nyseg and ask them for an offcycle meter reading so that your billing cycle will end and your service can be switched back more quickly • we do not charge cancellation fees nor lock customers into a contract customers can try our service and if they are dissatisfied they can cancel at any time without penalty unlike our competitors we offer many different programs which provide extra value to customers such as earning cash back or airline miles we encourage customers to ask us about our offers to ensure they are receiving the benefit that best suits their needs reply reply  th of oct  by   hau tran  votes we got scam by energy plus also my first bill is double compare to central hudson charged us be careful with them do not listen to their promise i am thinking about reporting to ny attorney general office and see if they can do anything reply reply  th of dec  by   lincoln stoller  votes i was solicited by energy plus today and found the offer suspicious first i was asked to look at my central hudson bill to see if i qualified and then when i said i didnt have it i was told that i automatically qualified i was then offered to save on various minor line items such as sales tax but not told that this saving would entail changing subscribers first the sales person wanted to hook me i had previously been offered cheaper electricity by idt an offer i accepted and which resulted in huge overcharges such as are described above idt is a fortune  company that also offers the pennytalk calling card which is another huge scam that cost me up to a couple of hundred dollars when i attempted to buy their calling card to avoid expensive off system cell phone charges during a trip to canada pennytalk is advertised in the aaa magazine which is where i first learned of it i incorrectly thought aaa would somehow vet their advertisers at a minimal level but that was wishful thinking having determined that idt was essentially a criminal enterprise and that the sale of bargain electricity was attracting companies of this kind i was naturally suspicious of energy plus i persisted in asking the energy plus sales rep questions about what my rate would be but the best they could say was that theyd been consistently low i had to dig at them to get them to clarify that the rate was floating and that it was not guaranteed to be anything in particular in the future at this point i told them the best i could do was research their offer and get back to them having found the above reports of overcharging my research is finished and so is my interest in their offer reply reply  th of dec  by   ppy  votes i just received ad by mail about energy plus after reading all these negative about this company i am not switching over to it from clp i dont

told my father to call them and demand his money back for the ripoff plus he never got his  rebate that they promised and it he has been with them over a year good luck ny residents and we should do something with the ny attorney general office reply reply  nd of feb  by   jfav  votes i am furious the same thing happened to us with energy plus  in the last  months we have been charged  more than we would have paid had we been with national grid as our supplier it makes me so angry that they get away with the false advertising needless to say weve since switched back and will never make that mistake again reply reply  th of feb  by   f energy plus  votes im a con ed coustomer in ny and was told that i would have to wait for at least one billing cycle to complete for energy plus to be removed from my account after finally waking up and doing research you need to ask con edison to canel your current account and recreate a new account for you if you want to drop energy plus immediately they will not offer that option to you you need to request it reply reply  th of feb  by   joe policastro jr  votes i just got the promotion in the mail and after reading these

much detailm so i was immediately suspicious thanks to these postings i am going to toss in the garbage their offer i do have a question on how do i know if im getting the best price from my current provider any insight into tis would be greatly appreciated reply reply  th of feb  by   rsmitty  votes i just received a bill from energy plus that was  per kwh called central hudson to see what they are charging and it is  do not be tempted to switch based on the promise of miles or hotel points this will end up costing you big  they have no explanation for their outrageous rates other than they buy electricity daily and costs have been rising reply reply  st of feb  by   ray  votes i just noticed the difference today between energy plus and con edison as the electricity supplier i am very stupid to believe them i can save money by switching from con ed to energy plus i took out all my bills over  months and compared the difference from my friend which lives next to me the latest billing summary as of jan   i used  kwh the total delivery charges is    electricity supply charges by energy plus   however you know what i found out from my friends bill he got total charges  he used  kwh total delivery charges is    electricity supply charges by con edison   which he paid about  less than me even used more electricity than me what a shame for energy plus thus i briefly calculate the overpaid for  months and i have the total  in conclusion energy plus is a scam go call your original supplier and switch back to it you can save several hundred bucks in a year reply reply  rd of mar  by   hlbstb  votes thank you for all these posts im in ct and we just received this offer in the mail they have been harrassing us about changing which made me suspicious even after telling them that we would call them if we wnated it they called at least  times a day total harrassment i will stay with my current provider for now reply reply  th of mar  by   bettym  votes i tried speaking with a coned rep about my bill she was totally rude and i was on hold for about  minutes they basically instructed me to call energy plus and ask for my money back when you go to a gas station fill up your tank and then find another station with gas  cents cheaper do you get a refund when calling energy plus to discuss i spoke with a very polite rep who answered my questions rates are variable and there were many months my rate was lower than coned i doubt coned would give me any credit for those months bottom line there are no guarantees every company will save you every month at least you have a choice coned will gauge your eyeballs out with delivery charges regardless of who your supply comes from and they could care less reply reply  th of mar  by   rodriguez fabien

today reply reply  th of feb  by   sge  votes energy plus holdings  scam stay away from this companyenergy plus holdingsunited statesplease read this if you are considering switching your electric supply company to energy plus over two years ago i switched to energy plus after speaking to one of their sales people they told me i should see and an average of  savings over my current supplier’s charges in addition to getting  back into my sons upromise account as well as a  signing bonus that would also go into the upromise account i believed energy pluss representation and i signed up i now regret it and partially blame myself because i didnt’ listen to my wife my wife knew something was wrong she pays the utility bills and on several occasions she had told me that the electric bills seemed really high as compared to the past i dismissed her concerns with a statement like  energy is getting more expensive dont worry we have a good deal i now know what an  i was not to listen to her last week my wife insisted i call to have the meter checked because of how high the bill was i did call and was shocked when national grid told me that in my most recent bill i paid over  cents per kwh to energy plus when national grid was charging a little over  cents i immediately called energy plus and spoke to a supervisor this is where it gets interesting the supervisor was apologetic and explained that recently their cost had spiked but generally speaking over time everything averaged out and that they offered competitive electric supply rates i now know that this word competitive” is a word energy plus uses a lot to cover their deception and presumably walk the fine line of legality their idea and anybody else’s idea of competitive is quite different the supervisor i spoke with did a quick review of my account and told me that indeed over the last year i had paid a bit more than my original supplier would have charged but the year prior to that i had done well he assured me that he would look at the last year of my bills and see if some adjustment could be made while i was waiting for the supervisors call back i did a bit of investigating myself i googled energy plus scam and was not surprised to see the page fill with complaints of overcharging then i took a detailed look at my last  months of electric bills noted the amount charged by energy plus for my energy supply and called national grid previous supplier and got the amount they had been charging during the same period the result of this simple check dropped my jaw in disbelief i had been taken to the cleaners the initial three months after signing were nearly identical to my previous supplier’s rate and then for the next  months energy plus overcharged me from  to over  more each month than what i would have been charged if i had stayed with national grid most of the months the overcharge was between  and  i called the energy plus supervisor back and asked him to look back a bit further than one year because his representation that the first year of their service i had done well was much like the original sales spiel not true the supervisor then told me that i shouldnt forget that all the while i had been benefiting from the  rebate back to my son’s upromise account and that their rate had been clearly stated on my bill he went on to say that i could have canceled at anytime free of charge and that as it turns out their company isnt as competitive theres that word again in my area as they are in other areas i again brought up the salespersons original representation of saving an average of  annually on my electric supply the supervisor acknowledged that this was a statement that his company’s sales people would sometimes make the following excerpt is from energy plus’s web site as of  “as with all variable rate plans your supply price may fluctuate on a monthly basis – lower or higher – to reflect the current state of each power market however in order to make an informed comparison to competitive offers customers should average their bills over the course of several months or seasons rather than taking a snapshot of just one month our goal is to be competitive with other energy suppliers and your local utility company over the long run while offering valuable rewards” well i would say that energy plus was not very good at meeting their goal notice again the frequent use of competitive in energy plus’s well crafted statement the statement implies savings and in essence says you really can’t make an informed decision unless you wait through seasons of their inflated bills to make a decision rather insulting energy plus doesn’t list any rates past or current on their web site for a good reason it would limit the number of people they could take advantage of they rather you take their word regrettably i did the supervisor did get back to me that day and offered me  and advised me that he didnt have to offer that six hundred dollars isnt close to what their overcharges amounted to he went on to say that he was only able to go back one year in my account and that would be the best he could do ive severed my relationship with energy plus and am waiting for the check now i fully expect the check to have some kind of statement below the endorsement area which will release them of any further liability if that is the case i will not be signing it either way i will be filing a complaint with the nys public service commission  complaints in  and perhaps the nys attorney general in the coming weeks it is indeed scary that a company like this can continue to do business in nys why hasnt the nys public service commission shut them down why have the energy plus executives not been prosecuted for fraud i hope that upromise has or is in the process of disassociating themselves from energy plus bottom line be very careful with these nonmainstream energy companies as it turns out after checking public service commission complaints there are many companies like energy plus out there preying on good people because they can somehow they are allowed to continue to do business this is truly a buyer beware
