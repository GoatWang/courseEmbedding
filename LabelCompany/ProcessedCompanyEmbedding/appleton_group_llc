technique to produce returns that are more consistent and beneficial to the investor … in the importance of focusing on the core competency of wealth management alone … in creating a culture of compliance in which conflicts of interest are eliminated and in which portfolio performance is reported fairly … in the value of transparency working to create realistic and achievable expectations based on a complete and thorough performance history … in the importance of professional relationships with independent thirdparties including regulators independent auditors outside counsel custodians information technology partners and advisors investment philosophythe appleton group wealth management discipline™ is designed to address an investor’s desire to achieve useful predictable and meaningful portfolio returns over time with only as much investment risk as is absolutely necessary along the way it targets net portfolio returns over time that are considered generally necessary for an individual investor to maintain distributions in retirement for endowmentspensions to meet spending goals in perpetuity and for preretirees to achieve measurable progress toward saving goals the appleton group wealth management discipline combines three fundamental aspects to successful portfolio management  what to own  how much to own and  when to own it addresses the importance of investing in both “atrisk assets” and “norisk assets” and the importance of adjusting an investor’s exposure to each in response to changing market conditions implementation of the appleton group wealth management discipline is designed to be systematic in nature objective and most importantly is designed to produce performance characteristics that are predictable and repeatable during various market environments the discipline seeks to efficiently balance investment risk with investment reward systematically exposing investors to more “atrisk assets” during periods of sustained market advances and in turn to more “riskfree assets” during periods of sustained market declines it seeks to limit portfolio losses during market environments that are unsupportive of atrisk assets and seeks to achieve significant market correlation during environments that are supportive of atrisk assets although the appleton group wealth management discipline prioritizes risk and return management over tax efficiency our experience has also helped high networth and high income investors successfully manage today’s complex tax code the appleton group wealth management discipline has a measurable performance history through all three market environments rising markets falling markets and stagnant markets this performance history is rigorously documented and includes all necessary metrics for advisors and investors to objectively evaluate the benefits and limitations of the discipline such metrics include mean return net performance beta risk alpha value added by manager standard deviation
