following is a summary of the application the complete application may be obtained for a fee from the secs public reference branch  fifth street nw washington dc  tel   applicants representations  the trust was organized on july   as a delaware business trust and is registered with the sec as an openend investment company the trust consists of multiple separately managed investment portfolios “portfolios” and may in the future issue shares of additional portfolios  met advisory serves as manager of the trust met advisory is a subsidiary of met life investors group inc formerly known as security first group inc which in turn is an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of metropolitan life insurance company the manager is responsible for providing investment management and certain administrative services to the trust and in the exercise of such responsibility selects other affiliated and unaffiliated registered investment advisers “advisers” for each of the portfolios and monitors the advisers investment programs and results reviews brokerage matters oversees compliance matters and supervises the provision of services by third parties as the trusts custodian and administrator the manager will enter into investment advisory agreements with the advisers that will be primarily responsible for the daytoday investment programs of each portfolio met advisory is registered under the investment advisers act of   the funds including the trust propose to offer shares of one or more of their series to insurance company separate accounts that fund variable annuity and variable life insurance to insurance company separate accounts that fund variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts the “contracts” established by participating insurance companies including security first life insurance company which is in the process of changing its name to metlife investors usa insurance company and certain of its affiliates these separate accounts may be registered as investment companies under the act or exempt from registration under the act each participating insurance company will enter into a fund participation agreement with the funds in which the participating separate account invests  the funds also will offer shares of each series directly to plans outside of the separate account context the plans may choose from one of several series of any of the funds as the sole investment under the plan or as one of several investments plan participants may or may not be given the right to select among funds depending on the plans plan participants include not only those participants of qualified pension or retirement plans as set forth in treasury regulation § fiii and revenue ruling  but also include the holders of annuity contracts described in section b of the code including section b holders of individual retirement accounts described in section b of the code and holders of any other trust account contract or annuity that is determined to be within the scope of treasury regulation § fiii  in addition shares of a fund may be offered to the manager an adviser or any of their affiliates for purposes of providing necessary capital required by section a of the  act or for other investment purposes in compliance with treasury regulation fii the return on shares of a fund purchased by the manager an advisor or their affiliates will be computed in the same manner as for shares held by a separate account any shares of a fund purchased by such persons will be automatically redeemed if and when their investment advisory agreement with a fund terminates to the extent required to comply with applicable treasury regulations applicants legal analysis  in connection with the funding of scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a unit investment trust “uit” rule eb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the act the relief provided by rule e is available to a separate accounts investment adviser principal underwriter and sponsor or depositor the exemptions granted by rule eb are available only where the management investment company underlying the uit offers its shares “exclusively to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company” the use of a start printed page common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of a single insurance company or of two or more affiliated insurance companies is referred to as “mixed funding” the use of a common management investment company as the underlying investment medium for variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of unaffiliated insurance companies is referred to as “shared funding” “mixed and shared funding” denotes the use of a common management investment company to fund the variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts of affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies the relief granted by rule eb is not available with respect to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same company or of any other affiliated or unaffiliated life insurance company therefore rule eb precludes mixed funding as well as shared funding  applicants state that because the relief under rule eb is available only where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts of insurance companies additional exemptive relief is necessary if shares of the funds also are to be sold to plans the manager an adviser or any of their affiliates  in connection with flexible premium variable life insurance contracts issued through a separate account registered under the  act as a uit rule etb provides partial exemptions from sections a a a and b of the act the exemptions granted to a separate account by rule etb are available only where all of the assets of the separate account consist of the shares of one or more registered management investment companies which offer their shares “exclusively to separate accounts of the life insurer or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled or flexible contracts or both or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company” thus rule et permits mixed funding but does not permit shared funding  applicants state that because the relief under rule et is available only where shares are offered exclusively to separate accounts additional relief is necessary if shares of the funds also are to be sold to plans the manager an adviser or any of their affiliates applicants assert that the relief granted by paragraph b of rules e and et should not be affected by the proposed sale of fund shares to plans the manager an adviser or any of their affiliates applicants therefore request relief in order to have the participating insurance companies enjoy the benefits of the relief granted in rules eb and etb applicants assert that if the funds were to sell shares only to plans the manager an adviser or their affiliates andor separate accounts funding variable annuity contracts no exemptive relief would be necessary none of the relief provided for in rule eb and etb relates to plans the manager an adviser or their affiliates or to a registered investment companys ability to sell its shares to such purchasers it is only because some of the separate accounts that may invest in the funds may themselves be investment companies that rely upon rules e and et and that desire to have the relief continue in place that the applicants are applying for the requested relief if and when an irreconcilable material conflict between the separate accounts arises in this context the participating insurance companies must take whatever steps necessary to remedy or eliminate the conflict including eliminating the funds as an eligible investment applicants have concluded that the inclusion of plans as eligible shareholders should not increase the risk of irreconcilable material conflicts among shareholders however applicants further assert that even if an irreconcilable material conflict involving plans arose the plans unlike the separate accounts can redeem their shares and make alternative investments because shares of the funds will be sold without either a frontend or a contingent deferred sales load such redemption is at the net asset value of these shares further the manager an adviser or their affiliates that purchases fund shares will agree to vote its shares of the fund in the same proportion as all contract owners having voting rights with respect to that fund or in such other manner as may be required by the sec or its staff applicants thus argue that allowing investment by plans the manager an adviser and their affiliates in the funds should not increase the opportunity for conflicts of interest  applicants state that current tax law permits the funds to sell their shares to plans the manager an adviser or any of their affiliates applicants state that section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” imposes certain diversification requirements on the underlying assets of the contracts held in the funds the code provides that such contracts shall not be treated as an annuity contract or life insurance contract for any period in which the underlying assets are not in accordance with regulations prescribed by the treasury department adequately diversified on march   the treasury department issued regulations that established diversification requirements for the investment portfolios underlying variable contracts treas reg §   the regulations provide that to meet the diversification requirements all of the beneficial interests in the investment company must be held by the segregated asset accounts of one or more insurance companies the regulations do however contain certain exceptions to this requirement one of which allows shares in an investment company to be held by a qualified pension or retirement plan without adversely affecting the ability of shares in the same investment company to also be held by the separate accounts of insurance companies in connection with their variable contracts treas reg § fiii  applicants state that the promulgation of rules e and et under the act preceded the issuance of these treasury regulations applicants assert that given the then current tax law the sale of shares of the same investment company to separate accounts and plans could not have been envisioned at the time of the adoption of rules eb and etb  applicants therefore request relief from sections a a a and b of the act and rules eb and etb thereunder to the extent necessary to permit shares of the funds to be offered and sold in connection with both mixed and shared funding and to be sold directly to plans the manager an adviser or any of their affiliates relief is requested for a class or classes of persons and transactions consisting of participating insurance companies and their scheduled premium variable life insurance separate accounts and flexible premium variable life insurance separate accounts and to the extent necessary any investment adviser principal underwriter and depositor of such separate accounts investing in any of the funds  section a of the  act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as an investment adviser to or principal underwriter for start printed page any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in section a and  rules eb and etb provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations on mixed and shared funding the relief provided by rules ebi and etbi permits a person disqualified under section a to serve as an officer director or employee of the life insurer or any of its affiliates so long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying fund the relief provided by rules ebii and etbii permits the life insurer to serve as the underlying funds investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a participate in the management or administration of the fund  applicants state that the partial relief from section a found in rules eb and etb in effect limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of that section applicants state that those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act to apply the provisions of section a to the many individuals employed by the participating insurance companies most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies within that organization applicants note that the participating insurance companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the funds therefore applicants assert applying the restrictions of section a serves no regulatory purpose applicants state that the relief requested should not be affected by the proposed sale of shares of the funds to the plans because the plans are not investment companies and are not therefore subject to section a nor is there a regulatory purpose in extending the section a monitoring requirements because the funds may also sell their shares to the manager an adviser or their affiliates rules e and et provides relief from the eligibility restrictions of section a only for officers directors or employees of participating insurance companies or their affiliates the eligibility restrictions of section a will still apply to any officers directors or employees of the manager an adviser or an affiliate who participate directly in the management or administration of a fund furthermore there is no reason why the monitoring requirements should extend to all officers directors and employees of the participating insurance companies and their affiliates simply because the funds sell certain shares to the manager an adviser or their affiliates this monitoring would not benefit contract owners and plan participants and would only increase costs thus reducing net rates of return  rules ebiii and etbiii under the act assume the existence of a passthrough voting requirement with respect to management investment company shares held by a separate account applicants represent that the participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to all contract owners so long as the sec interprets the act to require such privileges  rules ebiii and ebiii under the act provide exemptions from the passthrough voting requirement with respect to several significant matters assuming observance of the limitations on mixed and shared funding imposed by the act and the rules thereunder rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying fund or any contract between a fund and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority rules ebiiib and etbiiib provide that the insurance company may disregard voting instructions of its contract owners if the contract owners initiate any change in the investment companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii and biib and c of each rule  applicants state that the funds sale of shares to plans the manager an adviser and their affiliates will not have any impact on the relief requested in this regard shares of the funds sold to plans will be held by the trustees of such plans as required by section a of erisa section a also provides that the trustees must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the plan with two exceptions a when the plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the plan and not contrary to erisa and b when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c or erisa unless one of the two exceptions stated in section a applies plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting proxies where a named fiduciary appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or to the named fiduciary in any event there is no passthrough voting to the participants in such plans accordingly applicants note that unlike the case with insurance company separate accounts the issue of the resolution of irreconcilable material conflicts with respect to voting is not present with plans because the plans are not entitled to passthrough voting privileges applicants further assert that investments in the funds by plans will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by mixed and shared funding because plan investor voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of insurers or state regulators  applicants state that some plans may provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants submit that there is no reason to believe that participants in plans generally or those in a particular plan either as a single group or in combination with other plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage contract owners accordingly applicants assert that the purchase of fund shares by plans that provide voting rights to participants does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed and shared funding similarly the exercise of voting rights by the manager an adviser and their affiliates does not present the type of issues respecting the disregard of voting rights that are presented by variable life separate accounts  applicants state that no increased conflicts of interest would be present by the granting of the requested relief applicants assert that shared funding does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several states applicants note that where different participating insurance companies are domiciled in different states it is possible that the state insurance regulatory body in a state in which one participating insurance start printed page company is domiciled could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of insurance regulators in one or more other states in which other participating insurance companies are domiciled applicants submit that this possibility is no different or greater than exists where a single insurer and its affiliates offer their insurance products in several  applicants further submit that affiliation does not reduce the potential for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions adapted from the conditions included in rule etb discussed below are designed to safeguard against any adverse effects that these differences may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the majority of other state regulators the affected insurer may be required to withdraw its separate accounts investment in the relevant funds  applicants argue that affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to when a participating insurance company could disregard contract owner voting instructions potential disagreement is limited by the requirements that the participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be both reasonable and based on specified good faith determinations however if a participating insurance companys decision to disregard contract owner instructions represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote approving a particular change such participating insurance company may be required at the election of the relevant fund to withdraw its separate accounts investment in that fund no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such a withdrawal  investments by the manager an adviser or an affiliate will similarly present no conflict the manager adviser or affiliate as applicable will agree to vote its shares of the fund in the same proportion as all contract owners having voting rights with respect to that fund or in such other manner as may be required by the sec or its staff this “echo” voting requirement is similar to the requirements imposed by the sec on the voting of shares of an underlying fund held directly by a participating insurance company through a registered separate account should the sec no longer interpret the act as requiring passthrough voting privileges for contract owners the manager adviser or affiliate will no longer be required to vote their shares in this manner because the manager adviser or affiliate will “echo” the vote of contract owners there will be no conflict among them  applicants submit that there is no reason why the investment policies of a fund with mixed funding would or should be materially different from what those policies would or should be if such investment company or series thereof funded only variable annuity or variable life insurance contracts applicants therefore argue that there is no reason to believe that conflicts of interest would result from mixed funding moreover applicants represent that the funds will not be managed to favor or disfavor any particular insurer or type of contract  section h of the code imposes certain diversification requirements on the underlying assets of variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts held in the portfolios of management investment companies treasury regulation § fiii which established diversification requirements for such portfolios specifically permits “qualified pension or retirement plans” and separate accounts to share the same underlying management investment company therefore applicants have concluded that neither the code the treasury regulations nor the revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if plans variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts all invest in the same management investment company  applicants submit that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions are taxed for variable annuity contracts variable life insurance contracts and plans these tax consequences do not raise any conflicts of interest when distributions are to be made and a participating separate account or a plan is unable to net purchase payments to make the distributions the participating separate account or the plan will redeem shares of the funds at their respective net asset values the plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan the life insurance company will make distributions in accordance with the terms of the variable contract  applicants state that they do not see any greater potential for irreconcilable material conflicts arising between the interests of participants under the plans and owners of the contracts issued by the participating separate accounts of participating insurance companies from possible future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between variable annuity contract owners and variable life insurance contract owners  with respect to voting rights applicants state that it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving such voting rights to contract owners and to plans applicants represent that a fund will inform each shareholder including each separate account and plan of information necessary for the shareholder meeting including their respective share ownership in the fund a participating insurance company will then solicit voting instructions in accordance with the “passthrough” voting requirements of rules e and et  applicants argue that the ability of the funds to sell their respective shares directly to plans the manager an adviser and their affiliates does not create a “senior security” as such term is defined under section g of the act with respect to any contract owner as opposed to a participant under a plan or the manager an adviser or their affiliates regardless of the rights and benefits of participants and contract owners under the respective plans and contracts the plans the manager an adviser and its affiliates and the separate accounts have rights only with respect to their shares of the funds such shares may be redeemed only at net asset value no shareholder of any of the funds has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distributions of assets or payment of dividends  applicants state there are no conflicts of interest between contract owners and participants under the plans with respect to the state insurance commissioners veto powers over investment objectives the state insurance commissioners have been given the veto power to prevent insurance companies indiscriminately redeeming their separate accounts out of one fund and investing those monies in another fund generally to accomplish such redemptions and transfers complex and time consuming transactions must be undertaken conversely trustees of plans or the participants in participantdirected plans can make the decision quickly and implement redemption of shares from a fund and reinvest the monies in another funding vehicle without the same regulatory impediments or as is the case with most plans even hold cash pending a suitable investment based on the foregoing applicants represent that even should there arise issues where the interests of contract owners and the interests of plans and plan participants conflict the issues can be almost immediately resolved in that start printed page trustees of the plans can indpendently redeem shares out of the funds  applicants assert that permitting a fund to sell its shares to the manager or adviser of a fund or a series thereof or to an affiliate of the manager or adviser in compliance with treas reg  will enhance fund management without raising significant concerns regarding irreconcilable material conflicts section a of the  act generally requires that an investment company have a net worth of  upon making a public offering of its shares fund also will require more limited amounts of initial capital in connection with the creation of new series and the voting of initial shares of such series on matters requiring the approval of shareholders in addition the funds may wish to purchase a substantial portfolio of securities upon commencement of operations and will require capital to do so a potential source of the requisite initial or additional capital is the manager adviser or an affiliate these parties may have an interest in making the requisite capital expenditure and in participating with the fund in its organization however provision of seed capital or the purchase of shares in connection with the management of a fund by its manager adviser or any of their affiliates may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of rule eb andor rule etb  applicants anticipate that such investments by the manager an adviser or their affiliates generally will be limited in scope and duration and will be made only in connection with the operation of the funds given the conditions of treas reg f and the harmony of interest between a fund on the one hand and its manager or adviser on the other applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists furthermore such limited investments should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of irreconcilable material conflicts instead permitting investment by the manager an adviser or their affiliates will permit the orderly and efficient creation and operation of funds or series thereof and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of fund operations  applicants state that various factors have kept certain insurance companies from offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts according to applicants these factors include the cost of organizing and operating an investment funding medium the lack of expertise with respect to investment managers principally with respect to stock and money market investments and the lack of public name recognition as investment experts specifically applicants state that smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the contract business on their own applicants argue the use of the funds as common investment media for the contracts would ease these concerns participating insurance companies would benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of met advisory and the advisers but also from the cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by a large pool of funds applicants state that making the funds available for mixed and shared funding may encourage more insurance companies to offer variable contracts such as the contracts which may
