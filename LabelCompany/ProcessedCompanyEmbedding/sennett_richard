work together the rituals pleasures and politics of cooperationliving with people who differ—racially ethnically religiously or economically—is the most urgent challenge facing civil society today we tend socially to avoid engaging with people unlike ourselves and modern politics encourages the politics of the tribe rather than of the city in this thoughtprovoking book richard sennett discusses why this has happened and what might be done about itthe craftsmanthe craftsman names a basic human impulse the desire to do a job well for its own sake although the word may suggest a way of life that waned with the advent of industrial society sennett argues that the craftsman’s realm is far broader than skilled manual labor the computer programmer the doctor the parent and the citizen need to learn the values of good craftsmanship todaypracticing culturethe essays in practicing culture seek to revitalize the field of cultural sociology they show how to put theoretical sources to work in empirical research culture is a set of practices rather than static representations culture is made and remade in countless small ways and occasional bursts of innovation culture is something people

social relationships all are troubled by issues of respect whether it be an employee stuck with insensitive management a social worker trying to aid a resentful client or a virtuoso artist and an accompanist aiming for a perfect duet the corrosion of characterdrawing on interviews with dismissed ibm executives in westchester new york bakers in a hightech boston bakery a barmaid turned
