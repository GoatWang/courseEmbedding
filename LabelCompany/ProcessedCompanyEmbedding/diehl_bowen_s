our fourth quarter  earnings call throughout our prepared remarks we will refer to various slides in our earnings presentation which can be found on our website at wwwcapitalsouthwestcom we are pleased to report that fiscal year  marked the first full fiscal year post the spinoff of csw industrials and a year in which we achieved our goal of establishing a premier middle market lending firm our focus remains on building a portfolio that consists of a diverse set of debt and equity investments from both the lower middle market and the upper middle market to this point we believe we are well on our way to building a highperforming portfolio that generates market dividends to our shareholders while growing nav per share we continued to execute under our shareholderfriendly internally managed structure which at its foundation closely aligns our interests with the interests of our fellow shareholders in generating sustainable longterm value through stable increasing dividends and nav per share growth during our fiscal year ended march st we delivered a  allin return to shareholders paying  per share in cumulative dividends during the year while experiencing stock price appreciation of  we believe this is evidence of the market both understanding and appreciating the evolution underway at capital southwest from an allequity focused bdc paying a negligible dividend to a creditfocused bdc paying a market dividend slide seven illustrates our progress in this evolution during fiscal year  as of the end of the march quarter we generated a  annualized dividend yield to our shareholders exclusive of the  per share special dividend after increasing nav per share during the year from  per share to  per share though we are proud of our performance todate we look forward to continuing to execute on our strategy with a goal of producing a market dividend for our shareholders while increasing nav per share our investment strategy is described on slide eight which focuses on a blend of both lower middle market and upper middle market assets has served as well throughout this fiscal year the upper middle market capability provides us the opportunity to invest capital relatively quickly in times of excess liquidity and to rotate capital out of the upper middle market as we continue to grow our lower middlemarket portfolio the upper middle market capability also allows us to capitalize on market disruptions as we saw during the fall of  and spring of  our ability to underwrite strong credits in the upper middle market during this time resulted in heavy prepayment and attractive returns as the market strengthened over the subsequent  months as a result we were able to rotate those dollars out of the upper middle market into the lower middle market where we were able to originate highly attractive opportunities many of which provide a potential for equity upside we believe investing a portion of our balance sheet in minority equity positions in our lower middle market companies is an important aspect of our strategy our goal is to build out a granular portfolio of equity positions which as they appreciate and are harvested a portion will be available to pay out to shareholders as special dividends as was the case in the fourth quarter as seen on slide nine the evolution of our balance sheet continues as  of our investable assets are now in securities generating recurring cash income compared to  in mid when we began the transformation of capital southwest from equity investing to middle market credit this fiscal year as seen on slide  we grew our balance sheet credit portfolio by  million on a net basis with  million in new investments and  million in total repayments during the year of our new investments  are floating rate first lien and  are floating rate secure specific to the fourth quarter as we have laid out on slide  we originated  million in new investments all in the lower middle market and all floating rate first lien loans with the new portfolio companies having equity exposure the investments during the quarter had a weighted average yield to maturity on the debt of  as seen on slide  we received  million in proceeds from four additional portfolio exits during the quarter generating a weighted average irr of  this brings the total exits for the year to  million of proceeds from seven portfolio exits with a weighted average irr of  again we believe these portfolio exits demonstrate early evidence of the attractive risk adjusted returns potential for our investment strategy as seen on slide  excluding capital invested in i our on balance sheet investment portfolio mix was  debt and  equity at quarter end the weighted average yield on our debt portfolio was  for the quarter flat to the previous quarter on slide  we break out our investment portfolio between the upper middle market excluding i and the lower middle market the portfolio is approximately  weighted on a cost basis between the two markets we had  upper middle market investments comprised of first and second lien debt with an average hold size of  million a weighted average ebitda of  million a weighted average yield of  and leverage measured as debt to ebitda through our security of four times our lower middle market portfolio consisted of  investments comprised of first lien subdebt and equity investments with an average hold size of  million a weighted average ebitda of  million a weighted average yield of  and leverage through our security of  times as illustrated on slide  including our capital invested in i our overall investment portfolio grew to  million as of the end of the year with enhanced diversity and  of the invested assets generating yield for our shareholders during the march quarter as seen on slide  at our i senior loan fund experienced solid net portfolio growth increasing portfolio assets to over  million from  million at the beginning of the quarter and  million at the beginning of the year this quarter i originated  million in seven new and four addon credit investments while receiving  million in proceeds from the prepayment of five credits during the quarter as it has grown the i loan portfolio has maintained a weighted average asset yield in excess of our original business plan and an increasing roe to capital southwest the run rate recurring roe to capital southwest is currently over  in recent quarters however accelerated oid ph and prepayment fees have boosted annualized roes to capital southwest to levels ranging from  to  the i portfolio is virtually all first lien with diversity among industries and an average hold size of  of the portfolio the portfolio has a weighted average ebitda of  million and a weighted average leverage through the i security of three times we continue to see robust credit markets in a generally favorable environment for our portfolio companies in the upper middle market it has become more difficult to find value as spreads continue to tighten leverage levels remain high and many deals include dividend recaps andor covenant light structures in the lower middle market the flow of quality deals was robust during the quarter our pipeline remained solid through the quarter and has continued into the current quarter we continue to see the banks be conservative in their lending approach but we are seeing increased competition from nonbank senior lenders levering companies deep into the junior capital levels of the capital structure at very low senior lending rates essentially stretch senior lenders as they are often called levering companies to unitranche levels at stretch senior pricing overall the market remains competitive with significant liquidity needing to be put to work among nonbank lenders as well as private equity firms as we have previously stated to mitigate risk in times like these which we believe is characteristic of being late in the economic cycle we must aggressively broaden our deal pipeline but we must maintain both our conservative underwriting approach and high levels of investment discipline for example during the fiscal year  we closed on approximately  of the lower middle market opportunities we reviewed and approximately  of upper middle market opportunities we reviewed in every deal we structure and underwrite we stress test the capital structure by modeling a recession during our hold period equivalent to the great recession as a result we focus on situations where we can understand how the business and industry performed during the great recession applying capital structures to these businesses that are appropriate for their potential volatility and invest our shareholders capital in securities that will remain inside enterprise value with interest being paid during a repeat of such tough times while this discipline sometimes causes us to pass on opportunities or lose opportunities we like we are pleased with the credits we have added to our portfolio and continue to believe this discipline will pay off in the long run i will now hand the call over to michael sarner to review the specifics of our financial performance for the quarter michael sarner thanks bowen on the capital raising front during fiscal year  we closed on a  million ing capital led credit facility consisting of  million in commitments from five banks and a  million accordion as of march   we had  million drawn on their credit facility in addition we were able to close on the remainder of the i credit facility commitments led by deutsche bank bringing the facility to its target size of  million as of march   i had  million drawn on the facility as of the end of the quarter we had  million in balance sheet cash  million available on the ing credit facility and  million in additional capacity on the i credit facility leaving us with significant liquidity to fund investments going forward further we had a leverage ratio of  to  leaving us substantial running room to increase our balance sheet leverage and drive dividend growth for our shareholders turning to the income statement on slide  our investment portfolio produced  million in investment income this quarter with a weighted average yield on all investments of  this represented an increase of  or  from the previous quarters investment income of  million the increase was due to net investment growth in the credit portfolio during the quarter and an increase in prepayment fees as well as an increase in the cash dividend from i generated from shortterm realized gains we incurred  million in operating expenses excluding tax and interest expense this quarter an increase of  or  versus  million in the previous quarter the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to legal fees related to corporate matters and an increase in our yearend bonus accrual for the quarter we earned pretax net investment income of  million or  per share compared to  million or  per share in the previous period we paid a  per share quarterly dividend along with a  per share special dividend on april rd for the quarter ended march st our net investment income exceeded our quarterly dividend this quarter ph by  per share we continue to focus on growing our quarterly dividends in a sustainable manner our dividend coverage over the last  months was  as mentioned on previous calls as we continue to work toward our goal of receiving approval from the sba for a new sbic license with participation in the sbic debenture program we would provide updates to our shareholders we have received recent feedback from the sba indicating their preference to monitor our postspinoff progress and reassess our portfolio once it has had the opportunity to further season we appreciate the feedback from the sba and will continue our dialogue with their staff as we continue to build our lower middle market portfolio in terms of our capitalization strategy we have been actively working with banks to further diversify our financing sources and this delay should not impact our ability to grow our portfolio and achieve a competitive market dividend yield we will continue to update our shareholders with our progress toward receiving a new sbic license with participation in the sbic debenture program in the future finally this year we conducted a review of our organizational documents and determined that capital southwest and its shareholders would benefit from changing capital southwests state of incorporation from texas to maryland we found that capital southwest was the only business development company incorporated in texas with most other bdcs incorporated in either maryland our delaware due to those states welldeveloped case law and familiarity with registered investment companies after a full evaluation the board of directors decided that converting capital southwest to a maryland corporation was the most beneficial course of action for our shareholders in reviewing the details included within the maryland provisions the board of directors has proactively chosen to opt out of the several maryland provisions that could restrict shareholder rights in an effort to preserve current shareholder rights and distinguish ourselves from other business development companies incorporated in maryland the proxy statement includes a summary of changes that will result from our proposed conversion we strongly urge each of our shareholders to read the detailed provided for each provision change included within the proxy and contact either bowen or myself with any questions you may have i will now hand the call back to bowen for some final comments bowen diehl thanks michael and thank you to our shareholders for giving us the opportunity to be stewards of your capital a responsibility that we take very seriously we continue to thoughtfully and carefully execute our investment strategy with the creation of longterm sustainable shareholder value as our most important goal this concludes our prepared remarks i would like to turn the call over to the operator to open up the line for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bryce rowe of baird your line is now open bryce rowe thanks good morning bowen diehl hey bryce bryce rowe bowen i was  maybe youve covered this in past calls but did want to ask you about the undistributed spillover income on the balance sheet just curious how you think about that philosophically how you think about paying that out to shareholders over the course of time bowen diehl yes you want to cover that michael sarner sure so first of all thanks for the question bryce first of all thats built up first and foremost by some undistributed realized gains in the past as well as some of the taxable income that we earned this year that wasnt paid out we see having a uti balance is important sort of for the shareholders for a surety on the dividend we see ourselves paying out a portion in time certainly not the entire amount as we think building up and maintaining nav growth is important to our shareholders bowen diehl yes i mean like you said i think paying that out over time is our intent it does provide surety of the dividend in times where we might have heavy prepayments at the same time as light originations if the market gets really white hot and were just not comfortable investing theres also a benefit as we move towards a time where were above book and we have an equity offering on the table that it helps cushion the dividends the j curve effect if you will postequity offer bryce rowe yes got it thats helpful and then appreciate the comments around the market bifurcating both lower middle market and upper middle market it sounds like the upper middle market is increasingly competitive and maybe a little less attractive do we read into that that maybe future activity at least over the next couple quarters will likely be driven by lower middle market activity bowen diehl yes i mean i would say thats absolutely right our lower middle market activity is  were finding some pretty attractive opportunities as you saw in our quarterly release the deals we closed recently weve seen similar transactions coming into this quarter so the lower middle market as weve said before is our premium product the upper middle market is important to manage cash inflows and outflows its a slightly more liquid market obviously the spreads for quality deals have been  have tightened significantly i remains a very attractive financing vehicle given the terms provisions of that credit facility with deutsche bank so for the quality companies theres room  they fit in that vehicle and still create roes that make sense for our shareholders on our balance sheet those assets right now  were pretty heavily focused on the lower middle market because we think the value is there where its tougher on the upper middle market side bryce rowe yes got it and then maybe one more for you michael on the expense side of the income statement you obviously called out some bonus accruals incentive accruals as well as some legal expenses just curious what portion of that may recur here in the future thanks michael sarner sure so a portion of this was included in actually in the proxy when we discuss the reincorporation so were seeing about  to  of expense that weve spent over the last quarter i think were really at the tail end of that so some of that is going to go away and in terms of the bonus accrual the board had indicated based on performance for the company that they increased a few hundred thousand   for the bonus accruals for the entire pool this year and thats obviously a onetime in nature so we expect really the run rate to come back down to around a  million to  million on a quarterly basis bryce rowe great thats helpful thank you guys appreciate it bowen diehl thanks bryce operator thank you operator instructions and im showing no further questions at this time id hand the call back over to bowen diehl for any closing remarks bowen diehl thank you operator and thank you all for participating in our call today we look forward to keeping you apprised of our progress on future quarterly calls again shareholder value creation is our absolute
