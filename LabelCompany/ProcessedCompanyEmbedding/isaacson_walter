foes and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions perfectionism obsessions artistry devilry and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted driven by demons jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair but his personality and products were interrelated just as apple’s hardware and software tended to be as if part of an integrated system his tale is instructive and cautionary filled with lessons about innovation character leadership and values synopsis may belong to another edition of this title review amazon best books of the month november  it is difficult to read the opening pages of walter isaacson’s steve jobs without feeling melancholic jobs retired at the end of august and died about six weeks later now just weeks after his death you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth his promise and his relentless press to succeed but the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else which is the intensity of the readmirroring the intensity of jobs’s focus and vision for his products few in history have transformed their time like steve jobs and one could argue that he stands with the fords edisons and gutenbergs of the world this is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength chris schluep amazon exclusive a qa with walter isaacson q its becoming well known that jobs was able to create his reality distortion field when it served him was it difficult for you to cut through the rdf and get beneath the narrative that he created how did you do it isaacson andy hertzfeld who worked with steve on the original macintosh team said that even if you were aware of his reality distortion field you still got caught up in it but that is why steve was so successful he willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible so you did i never felt he was intentionally misleading me but i did try to check every story i did more than a hundred interviews and he urged me not just to hear his version but to interview as many people as possible it was one of his many odd contradictions he could distort reality yet he was also brutally honest most of the time he impressed upon me the value of honesty rather than trying to whitewash things q how were the interviews with jobs conducted did you ask lots of questions or did he just talk isaacson i asked very few questions we would take long walks or drives or sit in his garden and i would raise a topic and let him expound on it even during the more formal sessions in his living room i would just sit quietly and listen he loved to tell stories and he would get very emotional especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained q he was a powerful man who could hold a grudge was it easy to get others to talk about jobs willingly were they afraid to talk isaacson everyone was eager to talk about steve they all had stories to tell and they loved to tell them even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be q jobs embraced the counterculture and buddhism yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet in what way did jobs contradictions contribute to his success isaacson steve was filled with contradictions he was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire he eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire he talked at times about how he wrestled with these contradictions his counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created they combined artistry and technology q jobs could be notoriously difficult did you wind up liking him in the end isaacson yes i liked him and was inspired by him but i knew he could be unkind and rough these things can go together when my book first came out some people skimmed it quickly and cherrypicked the examples of his being rude to people but that was only half the story fortunately as people read the whole book they saw the theme of the narrative he could be petulant and rough but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection he liked people to stand up to him and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team and the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired q do you believe he was a genius isaacson he was a genius at connecting art to technology of making leaps based on intuition and imagination he knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers q did he have regrets isaacson he had some regrets which he expressed in his interviews for example he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend but he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family q what do you think is his legacy isaacson his legacy is transforming seven industries personal computers animated movies music phones tablet computing digital publishing and retail stores his legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now his legacy as he said in his think different ad was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do photo credit patrice gilbert photography about
