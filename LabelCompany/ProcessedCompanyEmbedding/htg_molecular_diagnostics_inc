mirna profiling micrornas mirnas are nt noncoding strands of expressed rna that are used by the cell for gene regulation while research in this area is still young these molecules have been implicated in various forms of disease which makes mirna profiling a viable method for biomarker discovery mirna profiling has traditionally been performed using microarrays rtpcr and srna sequencing these methods can suffer from tedious workflows and sample quality issues  learn more about the htg edgeseq mirna whole transcriptome assay product example profiling mir with an htg edgeseq system reliably

statement of work agreement to advance their partnershiphtgm’s price has been choppy recent increases might be precursors for a takeover bidauthor’s note htg molecular diagnostics htgm is a nanocap stock with a market cap of under  million this perspective is not an endorsement to buy sell or trade htgm but instead should be taken as an exercise in due diligence caution should be taken if investing in such a security which may be volatile and may result in substantial and rapid changes to investor principal some major movement ahead sometimes the market moves suddenly on stocks which if an investor can get ahead of it may result in significant returns while many investors are skilled at timing movements like this particularly in smallcap stocks i’m not one of them i prefer a larger stock with substantial earnings and even a nice dividend but i may be here at the right time to watch a big move htg molecular overview htg molecular diagnostics htgm is a small cap company with a focus on molecular profiling rather than inhouse drug discovery the company’s primary thrust is the delivery of mechanisms that can aid in cancerous tumor profiling combining several different advances to aid in identification and subsequent treatment htgm is taking on an issue with current testing which isn’t as efficient as it could be previously diagnostic workup required between  specially prepared tissue samples as technology has advanced and more information is both needed and accessible from a tumor subtypes mutation status etc even more samples are required but the more samples required the more invasive these tests become with respect to the patient for certain cancer types using nsclc nonsmall cell lung cancer an example these aforementioned tests are performed using several different methods the full profile isn’t compiled until the end of the testing which takes time standard tissue profiling source htgm additionally each testing method is a multistep process virtually all methods require nucleic acid extraction with the exception of fish fluorescent insitu hybridization which uses fluorescent markers to identify certain features in chromosomes nucleic acid extraction is a multistep process which is also timeconsuming not only that but inherent inefficiencies result in some sample specimen losses and may even cause biases in the results these limits of the current conventional methodology have led htgm to develop improvements the company’s htg edge technology platform allows multiparameter tumor profiling from very few samples with just one sample the htg edge platform is capable of exceeding industry performance in comparable tests source htgm the htg edge platform is able to reduce both sample prep time and quantity required since it does not require the complicated nucleic acid extractions which have hampered efficiencies of other testing methods htgm’s streamlined procedure source htgm the company’s approach has a significant level of automation while reducing need for some complicated techniques mainly the aforementioned nucleic acid extraction the advances brought about by the recentlylaunched htg edge platform are estimated to bring a  billion market opportunity within reach of the company other eyes on the prize htgm has made some important advances in streamlining tumor profiling techniques which have attracted the attention of another company qiagen qgen is also interested in the progress that htgm is making such a platform might fit well in qgen’s own molecular diagnostics segment if current trends are an indication qgen’s comparable oncology testing capabilities lag behind htgm’s while requiring roughly  times the sample tissue according to the above figures with  million in cash on hand qgen might just decide to buy htgm or its edge technology platform outright this advance would place qgen as a potential leader in molecular diagnostics regardless of whether a takeover is imminent qgen is slowly extending tendrils of control over htgm in november of  qgen announced the purchase of  shares of htgm roughly  of the current shares outstanding in addition to a still significant minority stake qgen has also been exerting control over htgm in another way recently qgen and htgm inked a statement of work sow agreement which will lay groundwork for a potentially multiphase project for development and commercialization of a nextgeneration diagnostic assay htgm will be initially paid “low single digit millions” in the initial phase as well as a share in net profits depending on the performance of the partnership qgen may decide that htgm will be an excellent addition to its own molecular diagnostics segment any value here htgm is a company with a highly competitive technology which may be in the sights of qgen as a possible acquisition target it might be useful to see a value estimate by discounted cash flow for htgm the next  years were forecast and used in the model an interactive model is included here all values are in millions except for final share price estimates the company’s products were estimated as one offering the htg edgeseq the market for cancer diagnostics is estimated at  billion with an annual growth rate of  this growth rate was used in the forecast with htgm projecting their htg edge platform to bring access to a  billion market it appears that htgm might be able to capture roughly  of the overall global cancer diagnostics market additionally with the statement of work agreement with qgen it was estimated that htgm would split revenues  with qgen although the takeover of htgm by qgen is a possibility this situation was not considered in the cash flow model htgm’s ebitda margins were estimated to rise to  of revenue over the course of the projection to maintain its product development rd was projected at  of revenue leveling off at  as the company matures depreciation and amortization da was estimated at  of revenue a bit lower than the company’s historical average net working capital nwc was estimated at a negative  of revenue concurrent with historical average free cash flow fcf was obtained from subtracting da from ebitda to give ebit taxes projected at  to account for future growth in company earnings were subtracted from ebit to find nopat net operating profit after taxes nopat was adjusted by subtraction of rd an nwc investment followed by addition of da to bring fcf wacc weighted average cost of capital was found from comparison of adjusted betas of comparable companies high and low estimated of unlevered beta were found and combined with estimates of equity and debt percentages of capital the estimated tax rate of htgm was used to find the company’s relevered beta estimates which were used as multipliers for market risk premium  the adjusted risk premium was combined with the risk free rate  and further adjusted to account for inherent risk of htgm somewhat significant since htgm is both small and volatile historical ebitinterest expense ratios for htgm were averaged showing interest rate coverage to indicate a high default spread estimated at  the default spread was added to the risk free rate to give an estimate of htgm’s implied cost of debt this was adjusted according to htgm’s tax rate to give an aftertax cost of debt high and low estimates of wacc were obtained by scaling costs of debt and equity by debt and equity percentages of capital respectively and summing the factors the midrange of the estimates  was selected as the discount rate and adjusted in increments of  basis points to give a range the midyear convention was used to find discounting periods which were then used in conjunction with the discount rates to form an array of present value scaling factors this scaling array was combined with fcf estimates for each projected year to obtain discrete present values that were summed to give a net value a perpetuity growth rate range was estimated from moderate decline to higher growth as htgm seems to have a significant growth opportunity with its product line the growth rates were used with terminal fcf discount factor and discount rate to give a terminal value estimate the present value of the terminal value was combined with the present value of cash flows to give an enterprise value estimate each of the selected enterprise value estimates were adjusted by addition of cash equivalents and other investments while debt was subtracted to give values of common equity common equity estimates were divided by the number of htgm shares outstanding  million used here to give several implied fair vale estimates modified sensitivity analysis gave a distribution of fair value estimates my fair value estimate of  lies close to the largest cluster of distributions in the projected range revenue projections ebitda projections rd projections depreciation and amortization net working capital free cash flow comparable companies relevered beta cost of equity cost of debt weighted average cost of capital discount factors present value of cash flows growth rates and enterprise value fair value methodology fair value range source author’s projections final thoughts htgm has developed a product that may have an “edge” over the competition in diagnostic testing this could lead the company to significantly grow its revenues in the near future while htgm appears to be set to grow with its potentially superior product it may even be a takeover target in the sights of qgen which has both purchased a stake in and partnered with htgm my price target for htgm  is roughly  above the current price whether htgm is purchased by qgen or if it just sits on its own merits htgm appears to have some potential for upside i consider it worth holding in my own portfolio as part of the speculative portion since htgm is such a small company author’s note i am on the lookout for high yet sustainable dividends or

read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forwardlooking statements due to various factors including those set forth under the caption item a risk factors overview we are a commercial stage company that develops and markets products and services based on a proprietary technology that facilitates the routine use of targeted molecular profiling molecular profiling is the collection of information about multiple molecular targets such as dna and rna also called biomarkers in a biological sample molecular profiling information has many important applications from basic research to molecular diagnostics in personalized medicine our technology can be used throughout that range of applications which is just one of its many benefits our focus is on clinical applications our primary customer segments include biopharmaceutical companies academic research centers and molecular testing laboratories as part of our business model we seek to leverage key business drivers in molecular profiling including the acceleration of precision medicine the migration of molecular testing to next generation sequencing the movement to less invasive biopsies the need for greater diagnostic sensitivity the need to conform to changing healthcare economics and the need for automation and an easily deployable workflow our products include instrumentation or platforms consumables including assay kits and software analytics that as an integrated system automate sample processing and can quickly robustly and simultaneously profile tens hundreds or thousands of molecular targets from samples a fraction of the size required by prevailing technologies our objective is to establish our solutions as the standard in molecular profiling and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic we believe that our target customers desire high quality molecular profiling information in a multiplexed panel format from increasingly smaller and less invasive samples with the ability to collect such information locally to minimize turnaround time and cost in  we launched our htg edgeseq technology which generates a molecular profiling library for detection of rna using ngs our htg edgeseq assays are automated on either our htg edge or htg edgeseq platform our htg edge platform is capable of running both our original platebased assays and our ngsbased htg edgeseq assays we continue to support a small number of customers interested in utilizing our platebased assays on a custom manufacturing basis however in  based on market trends and customer feedback we shifted our product focus fully to our ngsbased htg edgeseq system our innovative platforms and menu of molecular profiling panels are being utilized by a wide range of customers including biopharmaceutical companies academic institutions and molecular labs to simultaneously analyze a comprehensive set of molecular information from valuable clinical samples and improve the labs workflow efficiency customers can also obtain the advantages of our proprietary technologies by engaging our verio laboratory for preclinical and clinical researchrelated services we currently market several proprietary molecular profiling panels that address the needs of customers in translational research biomarker discovery and potentially companion diagnostics in addition we have a focused development pipeline that includes planned panels for translational research drug development and molecular diagnostics our product strategy is to develop a suite of profiling panels with initial focus in immunooncology and next generation pathology we have incurred significant losses since our inception and we have never been profitable we incurred net losses of  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively and had an accumulated deficit of  million as of december   as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately  million and investments in highly liquid corporate and government debt securities totaling  million and had current liabilities of approximately  million plus an additional  million in longterm liabilities primarily attributable to our growth term loan and nuvogen obligation we believe that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern while we believe that our existing cash resources are sufficient to fund our operations until midway through the second quarter of  we cannot provide assurances that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate we will need to raise additional capital in the near future to fund our continued operations additional capital may not be available in amounts needed by us even if sufficient capital is available to us it might be available only on unfavorable terms if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly reduce expenses sell assets potentially at a discount to their fair value or carrying value enter into relationships with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop or commercialize independently cease operations altogether pursue an acquisition of our company at a price that may result in up to a total loss on investment to our stockholders file for bankruptcy seek other protection from creditors or liquidate all of our assets in addition if we default under our term loan agreement our lenders could foreclose on our assets including substantially all of our cash which is held in accounts with our lenders factors affecting our performance our business model has evolved and expanded since our ipo was completed in may  primarily due to our success in the development of a biopharmaceutical customer base entry into collaboration agreements with certain biopharmaceutical customers and changing customer demand from product sales to service offerings in our verio laboratory we believe the mix of product and servicebased revenues will continue to evolve over time as our product menu expands and particularly if we successfully develop one or more companion diagnostic products as a result of our work with biopharmaceutical customers we believe that our future results of operations are dependent on several factors discussed below while each of these areas present significant opportunities for us they also pose significant risks and challenges that we must successfully address see the section entitled risk factors for further discussion of these risks biopharmaceutical biomarker and companion diagnostic solutions biopharmaceutical companies are working to improve the efficacy of their drugs by better targeting appropriate patients for specific therapies our products and services are being used by our biopharmaceutical company customers to identify molecular biomarkers that can help determine which patients will or will not respond to a drug candidate these customers can obtain the benefits of our technology by purchasing our platform and assays for their internal use or by engaging us to perform certain services due to the increasing demand of our biopharmaceutical customers for services throughout  we announced and branded our verio service laboratory our verio laboratory offers support for our biopharmaceutical customers in biomarker research and companion diagnostic development and further expands our traditional service offerings including molecular profiling of retrospective cohorts to support development of targeted and immunooncology therapies building custom researchuseonly panels to support early stage clinical programs and developing investigationaluse companion diagnostic assays for use in phase  registration trials we believe our product and service solutions provide us with a growing number of opportunities to collaborate with biopharmaceutical companies in their drug development programs because our technology is being used for biomarker detection and ultimately patient registration in such programs we believe we are well positioned to manufacture and commercialize highvalue companion diagnostic assays required in the corresponding drug approvals we track our pipeline of biopharmaceutical company programs as well as the number of such customers with whom we are working to measure our progress customer adoption of htg technology today we believe the primary measure of adoption for our technology is our companion diagnostic pipeline with biopharmaceutical companies discussed above in the future we expect increased sales of our instruments and consumables to our pharma customers or their contractors to support their internal research and drug development efforts and as discussed below to other customer segments as we add to our assay menu and especially as we launch high value diagnostic including companion diagnostic products we currently market and sell on a limited and targeted basis our research use only applications to biopharmaceutical companies academic translational research centers and in europe molecular testing labs our ability to increase instrument and consumable revenue depends on several factors including i adoption of our htg edgeseq platforms by our customer base including increasing market share for our proprietary panels for the research market ii the efforts of our sales and marketing teams to demonstrate the utility of our products and technology iii our ability to develop and market novel molecular profiling panels designed to meet customer needs including unmet medical needs iv our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our products to key opinion leaders so they will publish information supporting those benefits v pricing and reimbursement vi our ability to expand the addressable market of our htg edgeseq platform through the development of new applications vii our product capabilities compared with competition and viii successful outcomes to our companion diagnostic collaborations given the length of our sales cycle we have in the past experienced and will likely in the future experience fluctuations in our instrument and consumables sales on a periodtoperiod basis a key element of increasing adoption of our technology measured by instrument placements is our assay and panel menu menu is defined as what assays are available for use on the instruments to satisfy customer needs to sell additional instruments grow our installed base and drive larger consumable annuities we must develop and commercialize new assays our arrangements with biopharmaceutical companies are expected to generate new menu items as well as our diagnostic development strategies in immunooncology and next generation pathology as of december   we had an installed base of  htg edge and htg edgeseq systems in various stages of use including units that are under evaluation we are focused on high quality instrument placements and consumable pull through as the primary indicators of commercial adoption and success in our business timing and effectiveness of research and development expenses our spending on research and development may vary substantially from period to period due to the availability and cost of clinical samples prioritization of research and development projects or timing of milestone payments under technology development agreements we have instituted a stagegate based method of new product development managed by an innovation council which is led by our chief executive officer all programs are reviewed by time quality and budgetary metrics at each phase of the project financial operations overview and results of operations comparison of the years ended december

   revenue we generate revenue from the sale of our htg edge and htg edgeseq platforms and our consumables which consist primarily of our proprietary molecular profiling panels and other assay components together all such consumables may be referred to as assays assay kits or kits we also generate revenue through the sale of services related to our proprietary technology such as sample processing custom researchuseonly assay development and pursuant to collaboration agreements with our biopharmaceutical customers development of ivd assays because of increased demand for sample processing by our biopharmaceutical customers a trend that we expect to continue in future reporting periods we announced and branded of our verio laboratory service in the second quarter of  total revenue for the year ended december   increased by  to  million compared with total revenue of  million for the year ended december   product revenue product revenue includes revenue from the sale of

represented  and  of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively the decrease in instrument revenue from  to  is primarily attributable to our focus on biopharmaceutical customers whose preference has been to access our technology via services through our verio laboratory we expect our revenue mix to continue to contain a higher portion of biopharmaceutical service revenue in the near term until we enter the commercial clinical diagnostic market revenue from the sale of consumables is derived from the sale of our researchuseonly molecular profiling assays for use on our htg edgeseq platform and from the sale of custom molecular profiling assays that we have developed for customers consumable revenue for the year ended december   was  million compared with  million for the year ended december   and represented  and  of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively in addition to the increase in biopharmaceutical customer demand for services discussed above we also experienced a significant reduction in consumable sales to a single customer from  to  the customer completed a large retrospective sample analysis project in late  while this customer continues to place orders for our mirna panel its  consumable orders were significantly below their  levels we believe this is not an unusual occurrence in the research market where orders are project driven our total consumable sales to all other customers increased from  to  service revenue service revenue consists primarily of sample processing and molecular profiling of

reflects our success in continuing to grow our biopharmaceutical customer base and expand our ability to serve the needs of those customers through our verio laboratory we have been able to enter into new and expanding biopharmaceutical collaborations partnering with biopharmaceutical company customers who have chosen the htg edgeseq system for use in their drug development programs and who primarily prefer to access our technology via services in our verio laboratory because of existing development agreements with biopharmaceutical customers such as bms and merck kgaa which were entered into in  and continued efforts to expand our services to biopharmaceutical customers going forward we expect our service revenue may continue to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in  cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue includes the aggregate costs incurred in manufacturing delivering installing and servicing instruments and consumables as well as the costs incurred for services performed for customers in our verio laboratory the components of our  cost of revenue are material subcomponent and service costs manufacturing costs incurred internally which include direct labor costs and equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with the manufacturing and distribution of our products additionally internal costs incurred in our verio laboratory including direct labor and consumables are included in cost of revenue for the year ended december   cost of revenue also included manufacturing costs that were paid to thirdparty manufacturers who were responsible for the manufacturing of our instruments at that time we completed capital improvements to our manufacturing facilities the first quarter of  at which point we began manufacturing our instruments internally further cost of revenue for the year ended december   included costs associated with our nih grant program for the years ended december   and  cost of revenue included significant fixed costs comprised primarily of manufacturing and service headcount field service engineers and facilities due to the fixed nature of expenses associated with direct labor equipment and infrastructure we expect our cost of revenue as a percentage to decrease over time as we increase product and service revenue further absorbing these fixed costs cost of revenue increased by  or  for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   since  we have directed most of our commercial and marketing efforts to our htg edgeseq products that do not utilize our chemiluminescent reader technology based on market demand we discontinued the active marketing of our original htg edge technology in december  provided that we will continue to support htg edge consumable needs for a limited number of customers on an asrequested custom manufacturing basis for some period of time the increased cost of revenue in  was primarily due to the write off of the remaining  value of our htg edge reader inventory the recording of a  excess inventory reserve for our original htg edge system and additional inventory write offs to cost of product revenue of approximately  relating to our htg edge and platebased consumables technology during the year ended december   despite these noncash charges gross margin as a percentage of total revenue improved from  for the year ended december   to  for the year ended december   this percent improvement reflects an increase in product and service revenues allowing us to further absorb our largely fixed manufacturing costs and an overall the reduction of manufacturing costs resulting from a change to internally manufactured instruments which began early in  research and development expenses research and development expenses represent costs to develop new proprietary panels and corresponding assays to obtain fda approval for our first us ivd assay and to continue to develop and improve our htg edgeseq platform these expenses include payroll and related expenses consulting expenses laboratory supplies and equipment and amounts incurred under collaborative supply or development agreements research and development costs are expensed as incurred research and development expenses increased by  million or  for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   we expect research and development costs to continue to increase in  due to the ongoing development of our v chemistry and the possible resumption of our project janus development efforts in the second half of  in addition we expect higher costs from collaboration projects under agreements with our biopharmaceutical customers and costs associated with the fourth and final submission for our first pma selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales and marketing regulatory legal executive management and finance and accounting functions the expenses also include thirdparty professional and consulting fees incurred by these functions promotional expenses and facility and overhead costs for our administrative offices selling general and administrative expenses increased by  million or  for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   this year over year increase was primarily a result of operating as a public company for a full year including expenses related to compliance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq global market noncash stockbased compensation expense additional director and officer insurance costs investor relations activities and other administrative and professional services this increase also included higher sales and marketing costs related to a reorganization of our usbased commercial sales team increased commercial sales activities in europe expansion of marketing efforts to accelerate market adoption of our products and commissions on overall increased revenue generated in  loss from change in stock warrant valuation loss from the change in stock warrant valuation for the year ended december   was a result of an increase in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants just prior to the exercise of series d preferred stock warrants and the conversion to common stock warrants of our series c preferred stock warrants convertible note warrants and growth term loan warrants at the time of our initial public offering the increase in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants until their conversion to common stock warrants was primarily attributable to the proximity to and increased likelihood of completing an initial public offering there was no loss from change in stock warrant valuation for the year ended december   interest expense as of december   we had an obligation due to nuvogen research llc or nuvogen in the amount of  million under an asset purchase agreement and an obligation due to a syndicate of two lending institutions of  million net of discount and deferred financing costs under a growth term loan entered into in august  and amended in august  and june  interest expense relating to borrowings under our term loan agreements and noncash interest expense related to our obligation to nuvogen increased by  for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   the year over year increase was primarily the result of interest discount and final fee premium recognized in  on the  million growth term loan borrowed in march  partially offset by reduced interest on the original growth term loan and the nuvogen obligation as principal payments were made on both liabilities in  loss on settlement of convertible debt with completion of our initial public offering in may  our remaining convertible note debt discount and deferred financing costs relating to the convertible notes totaling  million were charged to loss on settlement of
