the assets of the northbrook separate accounts and will become directly liable for northbrooks liabilities and obligations with respect to the northbrook contracts then outstanding each northbrook contract owner will become a contract owner of allstate by operation of law the merger will not affect the provisions of or the rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts moreover the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the northbrook contracts nor will the merger affect the values determined under the northbrook contracts the merger will not affect any current allstate contract owners no charges will be imposed on or other deductions made from the northbrook separate accounts or allstate separate account i in connection with the merger in addition no payments will be required or charges imposed under the northbrook contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed no new investment options will be made available to owners of the northbrook contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated each subaccount of the northbrook separate accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger the merger will not directly affect any of the underlying funds the underlying funds will not be a party to the merger or any related transaction the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the underlying funds will not be changed as a result of the merger or any related transaction no investment portfolios are proposed to be added to substituted by or terminated by the underlying funds in connection with the merger or any related transaction moreover the merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the underlying funds the underlying funds assets or the charges imposed on the underlying funds or their shareholders in addition the merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the northbrook contracts allstate and northbrook have determined that no provision of the northbrook contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts northbrook contract owners with any right to optout of or to vote on or otherwise consent to the merger rather the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the northbrook separate accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of northbrook contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts will not change except that allstate will become the depositor of the northbrook separate accounts consequently northbrook contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the merger after the merger allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred northbrook contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the northbrook contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor allstate will administer the northbrook contracts in the same manner as did northbrook immediately prior to the merger all costs of the merger will be borne by allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of northbrook or allstate contracts each a contract owner and collectively the contract owners b the separate account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook life separate account will transfer intact to allstate and become part of allstate on the effective date it will change its name to allstate life variable life separate account a and have allstate as its depositor rather than northbrook no other changes to northbrook life separate account will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise northbrook life separate account immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of allstate as the surviving company after the merger in addition northbrook life separate account will continue to fund the same contracts it did immediately prior to the merger c the separate account mergers pursuant to the merger agreement the northbrook va accounts will merge with allstate separate account i on the effective date to achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings allstate will consolidate any duplicative subaccounts that invest in the same underlying fund the consolidation of the subaccounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each northbrook contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging subaccounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving subaccount the values of the exchanged interests under the contracts will thus be equivalent the accumulation unit values for these subaccounts will not change and the contract value of any affected contract owner immediately after the subaccount consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the subaccount consolidation the separate account mergers will not affect the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts that are not duplicative those subaccounts will remain intact within allstate separate account i and their net asset values immediately after the merger will be the same as they were immediately before the merger d the fixed account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts to allstate and allstate will assume northbrooks obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of northbrook that funds the northbrook mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of allstate at the same time allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of northbrook under the northbrook mva contracts issued prior to the merger the fixed account transfer will not change the terms of the northbrook mva contracts except for the succession of allstate as the insurer under the northbrook mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts e procedural matters allstate will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the northbrook separate accounts and allstates assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook under the northbrook va contracts and northbrook vli contract allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date existing northbrook contract owners other than northbrook vli contract owners will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstates sponsorship of the northbrook separate accounts as a result of the merger new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor northbrook vli contract owners will receive a new form n prospectus that reflects the change in depositor allstate also will file new registration statements on form s under the  act for the northbrook mva contracts allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date these new registration statements would reflect allstates assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook with respect to the northbrook mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a northbrook mva contract at the time of the fixed account transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstate as the issuer of the contract new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer in compliance with applicable state law allstate and northbrook will notify the owners of the northbrook contracts that allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of northbrook under those contracts following the effective date allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the northbrook contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii discussion for the reasons discussed below we are of the view that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the proposed transactions we also are of the view as discussed below that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers finally we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to northbrook and other named parties prior to the merger may continue to be relied upon after the merger by allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications the staff has responded favorably to noaction requests dealing with the provisions of the  act and the  act noted above regarding transactions similar to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer we respectfully submit that the proposed transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those noaction requests a section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers or the fixed account transfer  separate account transfer in our view the separate account transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account transfer would not change the northbrook vli contracts except that by operation of law allstate would succeed northbrook as the depositor of northbrook life separate account and coissuer of the contracts and would accordingly guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the contracts these rights and benefits eg surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by allstates larger pool of assets cash values under the northbrook vli contracts that are allocated to the northbrook life separate account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the separate account and its subaccounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the unit values under the northbrook vli contracts offered by allstate life variable life separate account a immediately after the separate account transfer would be the same as under the contracts offered by northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer therefore would not affect those aspects of the northbrook vli contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities eg the investment options available through the separate account the separate account transfer would have no effect on the northbrook life separate account except for the succession of allstate as depositor and coissuer described above and except for the change in name of that separate account to allstate life variable life separate account a the assets and liabilities that comprise the northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of allstate the financial history of the northbrook life separate account would be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by allstate would not change as discussed above contract owners will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the separate account transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently contract owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the separate account transfer based on the foregoing we believe that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer  separate account mergers in our view the separate account mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account mergers would not result in any change to the northbrook va contracts except that allstate would succeed northbrook as depositor and as coissuer of the contracts the rights and benefits under the northbrook va contracts would remain the same all of the subaccounts of the northbrook va accounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the northbrook va contract values immediately following the merger will be the same as immediately before and contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the merger the change in depositor following the merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding the identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations for example the depositor in effect guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required regardless of whether the relevant contracts account value has already been depleted thereby we respectfully submit therefore that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the northbrook contracts rather than to those aspects of the contracts that constitute or cause the contracts to be securities this argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security moreover even if the separate account mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of new or different securities such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of section  or rule  because contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the separate account mergers accordingly the contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an offer or sale to occur that would bring section  into play nor in this case will there be the kind of security holder action that under the terms of the rule is required to bring rule  into play  fixed account transfer in our view the fixed account transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the northbrook mva contracts by virtue of the fixed account transfer except that allstate will succeed northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the northbrook mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same northbrook will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts intact to allstate consequently when the fixed account transfer becomes effective allstate will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of northbrook mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the fixed account transfer and will not by virtue of the fixed account transfer have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of northbrook mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the fixed account transfer b section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer in our view the succession of allstate to the position of depositor for the northbrook life separate account as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act the merger will cause a change in the depositor of the northbrook life separate account which will involve a change in the coissuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that separate account however the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the northbrook life separate account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the northbrook vli contracts or to the contract owners the northbrook life separate account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes including financial reporting the commissions ectoplasmic theory in our view supports the position that northbrook life separate account as such will have a continuing uninterrupted existence notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets although the assets of northbrook life separate account will become assets of allstate such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account and for financial reporting purposes the separate account will be treated as a continuing separate entity accordingly to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the northbrook life separate account from northbrook to allstate following the consummation of the merger allstate and the separate account will file a new registration statement on form n that will constitute an amendment to the separate accounts existing registration under the  act the form n registration statement also will register under the  act any securities transactions effected under the northbrook vli contracts after the merger allstate will file the form n registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the merger c section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers based on the foregoing analysis we also believe that the separate account transfer does not involve an exchange of securities the separate account interests in the northbrook vli contracts issued by an investment company the northbrook vli separate account for securities of any other investment company for purposes of section  of the  act in addition for the reasons discussed above we believe that the separate account mergers do not involve an offer of exchange within the meaning of section  however should the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of section a and rule ab thereunder because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values thus commission approval of such transactions should not be required under section  of the  act d continued reliance on prior exemptive relief is appropriate we believe the exemptions under the  act that northbrook the northbrook separate accounts and the other parties named therein have received from the commission or its staff should continue to apply after the merger to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and other parties named therein to the extent they continue to be relied upon without the filing with the commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief their continued applicability is appropriate because the merger will not change the operations of allstate separate account i nor its relationship to its depositor any other separate account or contract owners the only changes resulting from the merger are i the substitution of allstate for northbrook as depositor for the northbrook separate accounts and as coissuer and insurer of the northbrook contracts ii the transfer of the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts to allstate separate account i iii the transfer of northbrook life separate account to allstate and iv the consolidation of the transferred subaccounts that invest in the same underlying funds it is our view that such changes have no impact upon and are not relevant to the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions in support of our view we note that the commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several noaction letters iv noaction request based upon the above facts and circumstances we respectfully request that the commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the merger including the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer or under section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers in addition we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein to the extent they continue to be relied upon will continue to be applicable after the effective date in the manner described above to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative

may be subject to current federal income tax see contracts owned by nonnatural persons page  and diversification standards page  section  provides that the proceeds of a full or partial withdrawal from a contract prior to the annuity date will be treated as taxable income to the extent the amounts held under the contract exceed the investment in the contract as that term is defined in the code the investment in the contract can generally be described as the cost of the contract and generally constitutes all purchase payments paid for the contract less any amounts received under the contract that are excluded from the individuals gross income the taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for purposes of this rule a pledge or assignment of a contract is treated as a payment received on account of a partial withdrawal of a contract upon receipt of a full or partial withdrawal or an annuity payment under the contract you will be taxed if the value of the contract exceeds the investment in the contract ordinarily the taxable portion of such payments will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates for fixed annuity payments in general the taxable portion of each payment is determined by using a formula known as the exclusion ratio which establishes the ratio that the investment in the contract bears to the total expected amount of annuity payments for the term of the contract that ratio is then applied to each payment to determine the nontaxable portion of the payment the remaining portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates for variable annuity payments in general the taxable portion is determined by a formula that establishes a specific dollar amount of each payment that is not taxed the dollar amount is determined by dividing the investment in the contract by the total number of expected periodic payments the remaining portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates once the excludible portion of annuity payments to date equals the investment in the contract the balance of the annuity payments will be fully taxable withholding of federal income taxes on all distributions may be required unless the recipient elects not to have any amounts withheld and properly notifies the company of that election with respect to amounts withdrawn or distributed before the taxpayer reaches age   a penalty tax is imposed equal to  of the taxable portion of amounts withdrawn or distributed however the penalty tax will not apply to withdrawals i made on or after the death of the contract owner or where the contract owner is not an individual the death of the annuitant who is defined as the individual the events in whose life are of primary importance in affecting the timing and

are purchased by an employer on termination of certain types of qualified plans and that are held by the employer until the employee separates from service other tax penalties may apply to certain distributions as well as to certain contributions and other transactions under qualified contracts if the penalty tax does not apply to a withdrawal as a result of the application of item iii above and the series of payments are subsequently modified other than by reason of death or disability the tax for the year in which the modification occurs will be increased by an amount as determined under treasury regulations equal to the tax that would have been imposed but for item iii above plus interest for the deferral period the foregoing rule applies if the modification takes place a before the close of the period that is five years from the date of the first payment and after the taxpayer attains age   or b before the taxpayer reaches age   the companys tax status the company is taxed as a life insurance company under part i of subchapter l of the code since the separate account is not a separate entity from the company and its operations form a part of the company it will not be taxed separately as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the code investment income and realized capital gains on the assets of the separate account are reinvested and taken into account in determining the accumulated value under existing federal income tax law the separate accounts investment income including realized net capital gains is not taxed to the company the company reserves the right to make a deduction for taxes should they be imposed with respect to such items in the future distributionatdeath rules in order to be treated as an annuity contract a contract must generally provide the following two distribution rules a if any contract owner dies on or after the annuity date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining portion of such interest must be distributed at least as quickly as the method in effect on the contract owners death and b if any contract owner dies before the annuity date the entire interest must generally be distributed within five years after the date of death to the extent such interest is payable to the owners designated beneficiary however such interests may be annuitized over the life of that owners designated beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that owners designated beneficiary so long as distributions commence within one year after the contract owners death if the owners designated beneficiary is the spouse of the contract owner the contract together with the deferral on tax on the accrued and future income thereunder may be continued unchanged in the name of the spouse as contract owner the term owners designated beneficiary means the natural person named by the contract owner as a beneficiary and to whom ownership of the contract passes by reason of the contract owners death unless the contract owner was also the annuitantin which case the annuitants beneficiary is entitled to the death benefit if the contract owner is not an individual the primary annuitant as defined under the code is considered the contract owner the primary annuitant is the individual who is of primary importance in affecting the timing or the amount of payout under a contract in addition when the contract owner is not an individual a change in the primary annuitant is treated as the death of the contract owner finally in the case of joint contract owners the distribution will be required at the death of the first of the contract owners transfers of annuity contracts any transfer of a nonqualified contract prior to the annuity date for less than full and adequate consideration will generally trigger tax on the gain in the contract to the contract owner at the time of such transfer the investment in the contract of the transferee will be increased by any amount included in the contract owners income this provision however does not apply to those transfers between spouses or incident to a divorce which are governed by code section a  paposnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd contracts owned by nonnatural persons where the contract is held by a nonnatural person for example a corporation the contract is generally not treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes and the income on that contract generally the increase in the net accumulated value less the payments is includible in taxable income each year the rule does not apply where the nonnatural person is only a nominal owner such as a trust or other entity acting as an agent for a natural person if an employer is the nominal owner of a contract and the beneficial owners are employees then the contract is not treated as being held by a nonnatural person the rule also does not apply where the contract is acquired by the estate of a decedent where the contract is a qualified funding asset for structured settlements where the contract is purchased on behalf of an employee upon termination of a qualified plan and in the case of an immediate annuity assignments a transfer of ownership of a contract a collateral assignment or the designation of an annuitant or other beneficiary who is not also the contract owner may result in tax consequences to the contract owner annuitant or beneficiary that are not discussed herein a contract owner contemplating such a transfer or assignment of a contract should contact a tax advisor with respect to the potential tax effects of such a transaction multiple contracts rule all nonqualified annuity contracts issued by the same company or affiliate to the same contract owner during any calendar year are to be aggregated and treated as one contract for purposes of determining the amount includible in the taxpayers gross income thus any amount received under any contract prior to the contracts annuity date such as a partial withdrawal will be taxable and possibly subject to the  federal penalty tax to the extent of the combined income in all such contracts the treasury department has specific authority to issue regulations that prevent the avoidance of code section e through the serial purchase of annuity contracts or otherwise in addition there may be other situations in which the treasury department may conclude that it would be appropriate to aggregate two or more contracts purchased by the same contract owner accordingly a contract owner should consult a tax advisor before purchasing more than one contract or other annuity contracts diversification standards to comply with certain diversification regulations the regulations under code

amount which is the first monthly payment the company may at the time annuity income payments are computed offer more favorable rates in lieu of the guaranteed rates specified in the annuity tables the amount of each annuity payment after the first is determined by means of annuity units the number of annuity units is determined by dividing the first annuity payment by the annuity unit value for the selected subaccount ten business days prior to the annuity date the number of annuity units for the subaccount then remains fixed unless an exchange of annuity units as set forth below is made after the first annuity payment the dollar amount of each subsequent annuity payment is equal to the number of annuity units multiplied by the annuity unit value for the subaccount ten business days before the due date of the annuity payment the annuity unit value for each subaccount was initially established at  on the date money was first deposited in that subaccount the annuity unit value for

the purchase payment breakpoints discussed in the prospectus the company may impose reduced sales loads administrative charges or other deductions from purchase payments in certain situations where

the first scenario is a reputational liquidity event since it impacts zoolander only  the second scenario is a marketwide liquidity event since it impacts the entire market ii describe the risks to zoolander’s ability to operate as a going concern and the consequences if those risks materialize commentary on question for the first scenario many candidates did not address the consequences from

making gics less competitive o appropriate since the current allocation percentage is low  establish a  million line of credit with a bank at a cost of  per annum o would be able to alleviate some
