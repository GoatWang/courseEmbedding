lotteries of life — the most valuable being his wife joyce and their seven children not to mention that lacerte who took only a few college courses is worth several hundred million dollarshe struck it rich in  when he sold a software company he’d started in his home  years before intuit inc paid  million in cash for lacerte software corp lacerte’s share was  million after taxes“i was very happy with my tax return that year and so was the government” he quipsmore recently lacerte is beating the odds with one of the worst forms of leukemia which he’s been battling since february “larry is the ultimate optimist” joyce says “he says ‘if there’s one person with aml acute myeloid leukemia who’s going to beat it it might as well be me’”some of you may be wondering why you’ve never heard of him“this is my first interview ever” lacerte says shifting a bit uncomfortably on a living room couch at his home in highland park “i’ve never wanted to be in the spotlight”perhaps you’ve been to the lacerte family children’s zoo at the dallas zoo or read about the sale of the lacertes’ park lane estate which fetched  million two summers ago — the largest price ever paid for a preowned dallas homebut you haven’t read much about lacerte the businessmanthe sale of lacerte software in  ran as a onesentence brief in the dallas morning news because lacerte didn’t release any detailshe could have bragged that he negotiated a purchase price that was four times the company’s gross annual sales or pointed out that he and his brother phil lacerte gave employees  million in thankyou bonusesrecent skirmishes with death have made the yearold reflective and his latest enterprise has him fired up about the future“i’m so passionate and excited about what we’re doing at exponent technologies” he saysthe company developed a webbased product that offers interconnected payroll legal and hr services for small and mediumsize businesses more than  companies have signed up for exponenthr which lacerte expects to bring in more than  million in sales this year“i’d really like to see  to  percent growth year over year for the next several years” he says “anything above that could be too quick i may be an optimist but now that we’ve proven ourselves there’s a snowball effect without doing a lot of marketing and sales presentations”lacerte says he’ll be happy when the company is covering  million employees and bringing in  million to  million “i’m betting that lightning will strike twice”larry asked joyce and her brother fidel baca exponent’s chief marketing officer to sit in on our conversation fearing chemo brain might cause him to trip up on names and datesduring our threehour interview lacerte nails all the detailskeypunchlawrence john joseph lacerte was born the youngest of six kids in vancouver british columbia in  his father moved the family to florida and started an accounting service bureau larry got his first taste of what computers could do as a yearold doing keypunch for his dadin  lacerte who was living in long beach calif bought two computers and taught himself programming then he created the first desktop application for tax preparation“i remember benjamin franklin saying the only two things you can count on were death and taxes and i didn’t want to be a mortician” lacerte says “what i loved about the tax business was that it screamed for automation and it had builtin obsolescence”lacerte sold the product himself telling accounting firms that they could buy a computer and software from him hire someone to operate the system and save thousands of dollars being paid to their service bureaus“their first question was ‘what’s a computer’” lacerte laughsin  lacerte landed his first customers mike serna and his son roger “they said ‘larry this is incredible who else is using it’ i said ‘well you’d be the first one’ trying to sound as enthusiastic as i could”roger and his dad signed on as guinea pigs because it seemed like the smart thing to do “larry was always on the ball and reputable and it just made sense” says roger serna who still uses lacerte products as a tax consultant in yorba linda califlacerte tax software revolutionized the accounting industry thirteen years after intuit bought the business an estimated one in four professional tax preparers in america still uses lacertebranded productsin the midst of building his company larry met joycelacerte usually tells people he didn’t go to college“when people ask ‘what university did you go to’ i could say ‘i got like  credits at long beach state’ but that doesn’t count for much what does count is i met joyce the love of my life there in ”he was  she was  they married the next yearby  larry had  employees and decided to move he found the state’s taxes oppressive and didn’t want to raise his family in southern california joyce was pregnant with baby no texas had no corporate or personal income taxes dallas was a housing haven with reducedpriced houses for sale everywhere“moving us to dallas converted us from a ‘california’ company to an ‘american’ company that could serve both coasts” larry says “new yorkers think californians are nuts and californians think new yorkers are full of themselves so being in dallas was a great thing for the company we tripled the number of employees and produced five times the sales in the next eight years”always thinkinglarry went into semiretirement after the sale to intuit but still managed his own portfolio“i made some good investments i made some bad investments” he says “the good news is we’re worth lots of money the bad news is we’re not worth a lot more”“managing all this money can be a fulltime job” joyce says “and everybody has a proposal at his th high school class reunion someone’s sticking a proposal in the car for him to read but larry likes to create and he missed the camaraderie of having a company”in  lacerte started thinking about what business needed automation most “the internet is this terrific ocean of freedom” he says “it doesn’t care whether you log on with an apple or a dell or a smartphone technology that was out of reach of small and middlesized businesses is now within reach”he settled on payroll and human resources because every business has those functions yet the price of software can be prohibitive “a lot of small and midsized businesses don’t have the gravy to have a whole hr department and a whole legal department and a whole payroll department” lacerte says “this is turnkey from timekeeping to taxpaying”the system is sold as a platform of services on a peremployee basis baca says a business with  employees would typically pay about  a year while the cost for a company with  employees would range from  to  annuallyalbert black chief executive of ontarget supplies  logistics in oak cliff which has  fulltime employees signed up as the first customer in “there hasn’t been one day since we implemented exponenthr that we haven’t found another jewel that has made us a better company” says black who is also one of lacerte’s closest friends“it gives us assurance” black says “if want you to kill a small business in a hurry just allow it to be out of alignment with the regulatory community — not filing the right taxes in the proper way when you need to file them”it’s also helped “automate” ontarget’s family culture as it expands into other markets it allows a free flow of communication and employee surveying at the drop of a hat“larry didn’t have to sell us we had to sell him” black sayslacerte has plenty of money to work with “i started the first company on a shoestring with me as the employee with the second company the sky’s the limit in some ways that’s a handicap the urgency diminishes as does the need to keep it lean and mean”the people working for lacerte are mostly folks from his first company “a lot of people took cuts in pay to come to be part of what larry is trying to create with exponenthr” says joyce an equal partner in the companygiven his weakened immune system larry has been running the business mostly from his various homes around the country “larry gives people the job and then doesn’t look over their shoulders” baca says “if they have a great idea they can go to larry they don’t have to go through all these layers it’s very handson“yet larry is very much the visionary you know what he’s trying to accomplish how it gets done and the details he doesn’t really care about as long as we’re all marching in the same direction”as black puts it “larry is the kind of man who will climb mount everest twice most of the time when people climb such a high peak they don’t do it again once is enough it’s not for larry”background larry lacerteage title president and
