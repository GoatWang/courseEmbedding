elementbinding proteins srebps a family of membranebound transcription factors since  goldstein brown and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the srebps from membranes thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids the machinery for generating active srebps is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances

biochemist he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  along with fellow university of texas researcher michael brown for their studies regarding cholesterol they discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when ldl receptors are not present in sufficient numbers individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases notably coronary heart disease their studies led to the development of statin drugs contents  life and career  awards  research papers  essays on the art of science  references  external links life and careeredit goldstein was born in kingstree south carolina the son of fannie alpert and isadore e goldstein who owned a clothing store goldstein received his bsci from washington and lee university in  and his md from texas universitys southwestern medical school in  upon completion of his residency goldstein moved to the national institutes of health nih in bethesda maryland where he worked in biochemical genetics in  goldstein relocated back to the southwestern medical center accepting a post as the head of the division of medical genetics at the southwestern medical center goldstein collaborated extensively with michael brown a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the nih from  to  goldstein and brown together published over one hundred major papers they are both listed in thomson reuters’ index of highly cited authors frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration goldstein like his colleague michael brown chose to continue handson research in  their postdoctoral trainees wang xiaodong and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins srebps a family of membranebound transcription factors since  goldstein brown and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the srebps from membranes thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids the machinery for generating active srebps is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances goldstein is chair molecular genetics at university of texas southwestern medical center together goldstein and brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees they have trained over  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and five of their former postdoctoral fellows thomas c südhof wang xiaodong helen h hobbs david w russell and monty krieger have been elected to the us national academy of sciences former postdoctoral fellow thomas südhof received the  nobel prize in medicine or physiology and helen h hobbs received the  breakthrough prize in life sciences in  goldstein received a national medal of science in the field of molecular genetics and in  goldstein and brown won the albany medical center prize in medicine and biomedical research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulinsensitive regulator which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus goldstein is a member of the us national academy of sciences  and the institute of medicine and he was elected a foreign member of the royal society formemrs in  goldstein was appointed as chairman of the albert lasker medical research awards jury in  and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier since  goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art

biochemist he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  along with fellow university of texas researcher michael brown for their studies regarding cholesterol they discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when ldl receptors are not present in sufficient numbers individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases notably coronary heart disease their studies led to the development of statin drugs contents  life and career  awards  research papers  essays on the art of science  references  external links life and careeredit goldstein was born in kingstree south carolina the son of fannie alpert and isadore e goldstein who owned a clothing store goldstein received his bsci from washington and lee university in  and his md from texas universitys southwestern medical school in  upon completion of his residency goldstein moved to the national institutes of health nih in bethesda maryland where he worked in biochemical genetics in  goldstein relocated back to the southwestern medical center accepting a post as the head of the division of medical genetics at the southwestern medical center goldstein collaborated extensively with michael brown a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the nih from  to  goldstein and brown together published over one hundred major papers they are both listed in thomson reuters’ index of highly cited authors frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration goldstein like his colleague michael brown chose to continue handson research in  their postdoctoral trainees wang xiaodong and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins srebps a family of membranebound transcription factors since  goldstein brown and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the srebps from membranes thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids the machinery for generating active srebps is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances goldstein is chair molecular genetics at university of texas southwestern medical center together goldstein and brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees they have trained over  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and five of their former postdoctoral fellows thomas c südhof wang xiaodong helen h hobbs david w russell and monty krieger have been elected to the us national academy of sciences former postdoctoral fellow thomas südhof received the  nobel prize in medicine or physiology and helen h hobbs received the  breakthrough prize in life sciences in  goldstein received a national medal of science in the field of molecular genetics and in  goldstein and brown won the albany medical center prize in medicine and biomedical research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulinsensitive regulator which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus goldstein is a member of the us national academy of sciences  and the institute of medicine and he was elected a foreign member of the royal society formemrs in  goldstein was appointed as

physiology or medicine  william allan award  national medal of science  formemrs  website profilesutsouthwesterneduprofilejosephgoldsteinhtml joseph leonard goldstein born april   is an american biochemist he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  along with fellow university of texas researcher michael brown for their studies regarding cholesterol they discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when ldl receptors are not present in sufficient numbers individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases notably coronary heart disease their studies led to the development of statin drugs contents  life and career  awards  research papers  essays on the art of science  references  external links life and careeredit goldstein was born in kingstree south carolina the son of fannie alpert and isadore e goldstein who owned a clothing store goldstein received his bsci from washington and lee university in  and his md from texas universitys southwestern medical school in  upon completion of his residency goldstein moved to the national institutes of health nih in bethesda maryland where he worked in biochemical genetics in  goldstein relocated back to the southwestern medical center accepting a post as the head of the division of medical genetics at the southwestern medical center goldstein collaborated extensively with michael brown a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the nih from  to  goldstein and brown together published over one hundred major papers they are both listed in thomson reuters’ index of highly cited authors frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration goldstein like his colleague michael brown chose to continue handson research in  their postdoctoral trainees wang xiaodong and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins srebps a family of membranebound transcription factors since  goldstein brown and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the srebps from membranes thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids the machinery for generating active srebps is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances goldstein is chair molecular genetics at university of texas southwestern medical center together goldstein and brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees they have trained over  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and five of their former postdoctoral fellows thomas c südhof wang xiaodong helen h hobbs david w russell and monty krieger have been elected to the us national academy of sciences former postdoctoral fellow thomas südhof received the  nobel prize in medicine or physiology and helen h hobbs received the  breakthrough prize in life sciences in  goldstein received a national medal of science in the field of molecular genetics and in  goldstein and brown won the albany medical center prize in medicine and biomedical research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulinsensitive regulator which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus goldstein is a member of the us national academy of sciences  and the institute of medicine and he was elected a foreign member of the royal society formemrs in  goldstein was appointed as chairman of the albert lasker medical research awards jury in  and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier since  goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art

physiology or medicine  william allan award  national medal of science  formemrs  website profilesutsouthwesterneduprofilejosephgoldsteinhtml joseph leonard goldstein born april   is an american biochemist he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  along with fellow university of texas researcher michael brown for their studies regarding cholesterol they discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when ldl receptors are not present in sufficient numbers individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases notably coronary heart disease their studies led to the development of statin drugs contents  life and career  awards  research papers  essays on the art of science  references  external links life and careeredit goldstein was born in kingstree south carolina the son of fannie alpert and isadore e goldstein who owned a clothing store goldstein received his bsci from washington and lee university in  and his md from texas universitys southwestern medical school in  upon completion of his residency goldstein moved to the national institutes of health nih in bethesda maryland where he worked in biochemical genetics in  goldstein relocated back to the southwestern medical center accepting a post as the head of the division of medical genetics at the southwestern medical center goldstein collaborated extensively with michael brown a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the nih from  to  goldstein and brown together published over one hundred major papers they are both listed in thomson reuters’ index of highly cited authors frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration goldstein like his colleague michael brown chose to continue handson research in  their postdoctoral trainees wang xiaodong and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory elementbinding proteins srebps a family of membranebound transcription factors since  goldstein brown and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the srebps from membranes thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids the machinery for generating active srebps is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances goldstein is chair molecular genetics at university of texas southwestern medical center together goldstein and brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees they have trained over  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and five of their former postdoctoral fellows thomas c südhof wang xiaodong helen h hobbs david w russell and monty krieger have been elected to the us national academy of sciences former postdoctoral fellow thomas südhof received the  nobel prize in medicine or physiology and helen h hobbs received the  breakthrough prize in life sciences in  goldstein received a national medal of science in the field of molecular genetics and in  goldstein and brown won the albany medical center prize in medicine and biomedical research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulinsensitive regulator which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus goldstein is a member of the us national academy of sciences  and the institute of medicine and he was elected a foreign member of the royal society formemrs in  goldstein was appointed as chairman of the albert lasker medical research awards jury in  and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier since  goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual nature medicine supplement that accompanies the lasker awards among his professional activities goldstein is a member of the board of trustees of the howard hughes medical institute and of the rockefeller university where he was elected as a life trustee in  he also serves as chairman of the board of scientific counselors of the broad institute and is a

homeencyclopediajosephlgoldstein joseph l goldstein joseph l goldstein b april   from kingstree south carolina is a nobel prize winning biochemist and geneticist and a pioneer in the study of cholesterol metabolism biography dr goldstein received a bs in chemistry from washington and lee university in  and his md from the university of texas southwestern medical center in  in  he received the nobel prize in physiology or medicine together with michael s brown for his research on the metabolism of low density lipoprotein ldl and has won numerous other awards for his contributions related to genetic diseases returning to the university of texas health science center in dallas in  now called ut southwestern medical center goldstein and his close colleague brown researched cholesterol metabolism and discovered that human cells have lowdensity lipoprotein ldl receptors that extract cholesterol from the bloodstream the lack of sufficient ldl receptors is the cause of familial hypercholesterolemia which predisposes heavily for cholesterolrelated diseases in addition to explaining the underlying pathology of the widelyobserved link between high levels of circulating cholesterol as ldl and coronary artery disease their work uncovered a previouslyunappreciated yet fundamental aspect of cell biology  receptormediated endocytosis in addition to contributing fundamentally to our understanding of how the cells in our bodies work drs goldstein and browns findings led to the development of statin drugs the cholesterollowering compounds that today are used by  million americans and are the most widely prescribed medications in the united states this crucial discovery is improving more lives every year new federal cholesterol guidelines are expected to triple the number of americans taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke for countless people despite the wellknown negative health effects of the typical american diet statins may well render death by coronary artery disease a rare event in the nottoodistant future subsequently the team lead by drs brown and goldstein elucidated the role of lipid modification of proteins protein prenylation in cancer in  he was awarded the louisa gross horwitz prize from columbia university together with michael s brown cowinner of  nobel prize in physiology or medicine in  goldstein also received national medal of science a highly acclaimed honor in the scientific world in the us in  their postdoctoral trainees xiaodong wang and michael briggs purified the sterol regulatory element binding proteins srebps since  drs goldstein brown and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery by which cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances dr goldstein is a regental professor of the university of texas holds the julie and louis a beecherl distinguished chair in biomedical science and the paul j thomas chair in medicine frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationallyprominent positions in scientific administration dr goldstein like his colleague michael s brown elects to continue handson involvement with research together they lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees he and his colleague are
