by these actions a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release todays rating actions have been taken as part of a periodic peer review of the alternative asset manager aam industry which comprises six publicly rated global firms fitchs outlook for the sector is stable reflecting the relative stability of core operating fundamentals given the lockedin nature of a large portion of fee revenue modest but moderately increasing leverage levels manageable nearterm obligations relative to available liquidity resources increasing assets under management aum diversity and investors increasing allocation to alternative investments particularly those managed by aams with strong franchises such as those included in fitchs peer review while fund realization activity has increased significantly over the last twotothree years leading to the amortization of existing aum managers have continued to replace capital and therefore fees with followon funds and expansion into other product categories through stepout strategies seed investments andor acquisitions the variable cost structure of the aams has contributed to relatively steady cash flows through cycles but feerelated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization febitda margins have trended down in recent years given lower fee rates on new product categories higher fundraising costs and because the cost of doing business has risen with increased regulation and administrative costs associated with operating as public companies still fitch believes margins are beginning to stabilize to some extent the febitda margin for a category aams averaged  for the trailing  months ttm ended sept   which compared to a  average for  leverage levels have increased across the industry as issuers have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue longduration funding average leverage defined as debt divided by febitda was x for a category firms for the ttm ending sept   which compared to an average of x at yearend  fitch believes the issuances have been largely opportunistic and views the reduction in refinancing risk favorably over time fitch expects leverage levels to migrate toward historical averages as cash proceeds are deployed into febitdagenerating opportunities while core issuer fundamentals remain solid aams have a significant amount of capital to invest at a time when credit markets are frothy and valuations are high therefore there is more capital chasing fewer deals which could lead to significant fund underperformance if competition bids prices up further outsized vintage concentration could potentially exacerbate this issue while most of the large managers have operated through a variety of market cycles and have demonstrated investment restraint pressure for returns from limited partners remains high given the length of time that interest rates have been at low absolute levels key rating drivers the rating affirmations reflect apollos strong competitive position as a global alternative investment manager its experienced management team solid investment track record large investor base predictable management fee stream given significant feeearning assets under management faum and limited exposure to assets that earn fees based on net asset value incentive incomegenerating capability relatively low leverage solid liquidity and the subordination of general partner interests to outstanding indebtedness the equalization of the ratings on the unsecured debt reflects the joint and several guarantees provided by the various subsidiaries which collect all of the fee carry and investment income earned by apollo general rating constraints for the aam space include key man risk which is institutionalized throughout many limited partnership agreements reputational risk which can impact the companys ability to raise future funds and legal and regulatory risk which could alter the alternative asset space rating constraints specific to apollo include the large exposure to affiliate athene holding ltd athene which accounts for a meaningful percentage of management and transaction fees and introduces potential regulatory and reputational risks and the recent occurrence of apollos business achieving scale which means the sustainability of margins is unproven over time faum amounted to  billion at sept   up  yearoveryear driven largely by fundraising for apollo investment fund viii lp and athenes acquisition of the us annuity operations of aviva plc the growth trajectory of faum has been significant in recent years given athenes acquisition opportunities fundraising for followon funds and organic growth in credit the sizeable faum base provides for a relatively stable fee stream over time and only a small percentage of faum  at q earns fees based on net asset value however there are meaningful fee concentrations related to athene and fund viii given their sizes apollo earns a basis point management fee on about  billion of athene assets at june   which represented  of runrate base management fees in q fees for fund viii should be relatively stable over the next several years as the funds investment period has only just begun but longer term the fee stream could be tough to replace as fund viii is the largest fund in the firms history and the largest buyout fund raised since the financial crisis fitch believes the potential reduction in private equity management fees following the end of fund viiis investment period could be offset by fundraising for apollos next private equity buyout fund along with organic growth in credit and real estate apollo had approximately  billion of uninvested capital to put to work at sept   at a time when valuations are high and credit market conditions are very competitive fitch believes outsized concentrations in current vintages could lead to fund underperformance down the road still apollo has operated through a variety of cycles and fitch believes the firms size diversity and global reach should provide for opportunities to invest apollos core operating performance as measured by febitda has been on an upward trajectory with growth in faum higher advisory and transaction fees and better operating efficiencies the febitda margin was approximately  through the first nine months of  or  excluding certain onetime transaction fees in q which compares favorably to the peer group apollos business really hit scale in  so while the sustainability of the model is somewhat untested fitch believes the retention of a strong operating margin is achievable carried interest income has been strong given the superior realization environment net realized carried interest was nearly  billion in  and  million through q which is at the highend of the peer group carried interest income is expected to decline near term given the amount of fund distributions in recent years but the valuation of current fund holdings and the diversity of the platform should support the generation of further carried interest in the future while this income stream is inherently volatile over time the potential for meaningful incentive income does help support the firms credit profile on may   apollo accessed the public debt markets for the first time issuing  million of year unsecured notes at a coupon of  apollo used a portion of the net proceeds to repay  million of outstanding termloan borrowings while the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes fitch views the extension of the funding duration and access to the public markets favorably as the agency believes it increases the firms potential funding flexibility apollos leverage as measured by corporate debt divided by febitda was x at sept   on a ttm basis compared to x at yearend  the decrease reflects the growth in fees and cash flow the ratio compares favorably to the a category peer group average of x at sept   debt service coverage defined as febitda divided by interest expense was also strong at x on a ttm basis but this will come down modestly with the incremental interest expense associated with the recent debt issuance fitch believes apollo has a sound liquidity profile at sept   the firm was in a negative net debt position with balance sheet cash of approximately  billion unfunded commitments to the funds amounted to approximately  million at june   and the clawback obligation assuming all positions were liquidated at their current fair values was zero apollo expects to distribute substantially all of its net aftertax cash flow on a quarterly basis which results in a relatively high payout ratio  yeartodate through sept   even as compared to certain peers still management does have significant discretion in its ability to reduce distributions in order to fund operating needs or to not pay distributions at all rating drivers and sensitivities the stable outlook reflects fitchs expectations that management will continue to generate stable management and advisory fees growretain faum through the raising of new and expansion of existing funds albeit at a much more moderate pace near term sustain recent operating margins operate with relatively low leverage and retain a solid liquidity profile in order to meet coinvestment commitments to funds declines in investment performance a key man event andor legislative risk which negatively impact the companys ability to raise faum and generate fees meaningful increases in leverage andor impairment of the liquidity profile could result in negative rating action furthermore ratings could be adversely affected if the relationship between apollo and athene were to materially change as a result of regulatory scrutiny outsized finespenalties or loss of management or subadvisory fees conversely positive rating momentum could develop from a demonstrated ability to operate at the current size scale and margin level over an extended period of time an increase in fee diversity lower leverage andor stronger liquidity would also be viewed favorably apollo is a global alternative investment manager specializing in private

the alternative investment manager im industry which comprises seven publicly rated global firms fitchs outlook for the sector is stable reflecting the relative stability of core operating fundamentals given the lockedin nature of a large portion of fee revenue modest but increased leverage levels manageable nearterm obligations relative to available liquidity resources increasing asset under management aum diversity and investors increasing allocation to alternative investments particularly those managed by alternative ims with strong franchises such as those included in fitchs peer review feeearning aum faum growth has slowed considerably for the rated peer group as numerous strategies have record levels of uncalled capital to invest fundraising is expected to moderate to some extent as a result but management fees are expected to retain their resiliency as capital not yet earning management fees shadow aum remains elevated and realizations of legacy investments have declined while an increase in market dislocations would impact the valuations and realization of existing investments it could also result in stronger management fee growth as uncalled capital would be invested at a faster pace that said fitch does not expect a widespread distress cycle to emerge over the near term the variable cost structure of the alternative ims has contributed to relatively steady cash flows through cycles feerelated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization febitda margins rebounded modestly in  and  as many alternative ims have begun to realize the scale benefits of followon funds and adjacent strategies the febitda margin for a category alternative ims averaged  for the trailing  months ttm ended sept   which compared to a  average for  and fitchs quantitative benchmark range of  for a category alternative ims still dispersion in the group is significant with a more than  percentage point differential between the highest and lowest performer driven by differences in strategy and product mix fitch believes higher margins provide enhanced operating flexibility through cycles gross realized incentive income has steadily declined since peaking in  driven by the length of time valuations have been at elevated levels a less supportive ipo environment and a reduction in the average age of fund investments exit activity has declined in  and is likely to moderate further which points to likely reductions in distributable earnings that said incentive income accruals remain strong and fitch believes realized incentive income may be less volatile than precrisis experience given the increased diversity of product platforms leverage levels have increased across the industry as issuers have taken advantage of the low interest rate environment to issue longduration funding for the purpose of funding balance sheet coinvestments acquisitions and in some instances to prefund maturities average leverage defined as debt divided by febitda was x for a category firms for the ttm ending sept   which compares to fitchs quantitative benchmark range of xx for a category alternative ims fitch believes the issuances have been largely opportunistic and views the reduction in refinancing risk favorably over time fitch expects leverage levels to generally decline to the benchmark range as febitda growth is driven by cost controls increased scale continued fundraising and the gradual deployment of faum that earns fees on invested capital counterbalancing the uptick in leverage is the maintenance of strong liquidity profiles several firms remain in a negative net debt position and  saw the introduction of perpetual preferred issuances by two issuers in the sector with proceeds to date used to improve operating flexibility and liquidity debt maturities are negligible for the sector in  payout ratios remain relatively high but fitch believes alternative ims retain the ability to reduce shareholder distributions as necessary to meet obligations while several share repurchase programs were announced over the last  months execution is expected to remain opportunistic and is not expected to impair the sectors overall liquidity key rating drivers the rating affirmations reflect apollos strong competitive position as a global alternative im its experienced management team solid investment track record large investor base predictable management fee streams given significant faum and limited exposure to assets that earn fees based on net asset value incentive incomegenerating capability solid liquidity and the subordination of general partner interests to outstanding indebtedness rating constraints for the alternative im space include key man risk which is institutionalized throughout many limited partnership agreements reputational risk which can impact the companys ability to raise future funds and legal and regulatory risk which could alter the alternative asset space rating constraints more specific to apollo include its large revenue exposure to insurance affiliate athene holding ltd athene which accounts for a meaningful percentage of management fees and introduces potential regulatory and reputational risks and leverage above fitchs tolerance level for a category alternative ims faum amounted to  billion at sept   up about  yearoveryear as inflows particularly in credit far surpassed more modest realizations and outflows the sizeable faum base provides for a relatively stable fee stream over time and only a small percentage of faum  earned fees based on net asset value as of june   however there are meaningful fee concentrations related to athene and private equity fund viii lp fund viii given their sizes apollo earns a  basis point management fee with certain limited exceptions on about  billion of athene assets which represented approximately a quarter of runrate base management fees in third quarter  q fees for fund viii should be relatively stable over the near term but the fund was  committed or deployed at sept   given a record quarter of private equity investment activity in q as a result apollo currently anticipated that fundraising for fund ix will begin in q and would have to gather as much capital as the largest fund in the firms history fund viii and the largest buyout fund raised since the financial crisis in order to fully replace the fees assuming no change in the blended fee rate fitch believes a potential reduction in private equity management fees in the event fund ix is smaller could be offset by continued growth in credit and real estate strategies apollo had approximately  billion of uninvested capital to put to work at sept   at a time when valuations remain high and credit market conditions competitive fitch believes outsized concentrations in current vintages could lead to fund underperformance down the road still apollo has operated through a variety of market cycles and demonstrated investment restraint and fitch expects the firm to be very selective particularly in this investing environment the firms average entry multiple for fund viii as of sept   was below x compared with an industry average closer to xx while lower purchase multiples are more favorable all else equal longterm fund performance will determine whether apollo is able to underwrite more conservative transactions or if the lower multiples corresponded to other investment risks such as those concerning earnings volatility challenged industries investment complexity or otherwise apollos core operating performance as measured by febitda was strong in the first nine months of  management fees tickedup on faum growth and advisory and transaction fees benefited from record private equity capital deployment in q which included a meaningful amount of coinvestment capital the febitda margin was approximately  for the ttm ended sept   which is at the top end of the peer group apollos business really hit scale in  and the firm has been able to maintain peersuperior operating margins fitch believes margins could decline modestly in q and  with more normalized transaction fees but they will remain at the upper end of the peer group at june   apollo had established a  million legal reserve in connection with an ongoing sec regulatory matter principally concerning the acceleration of fees from fund portfolio companies industry peers have faced similar inquiries and have settled for various amounts fitch believes the financial impact is manageable and the question of fee sharing is not likely to be an ongoing issue for apollo as fund viii provides for management fee offset to give limited partners  of transaction fees apollo continues to generate realized carried interest although the amount declined significantly in  and the first three quarters of  given that the firms realization cycle started earlier than the peer group net realized carried interest was nearly  billion in   million in   million in  and  million in the first nine months of  that said the potential for future carry remains strong as apollo had  million of carried interest receivable net of profit sharing expense at q assuming all funds were liquidated at net asset value this balance is linked largely to private equity funds and fund viii in particular which began generating carry for the firm in q  relatively early in the funds life while carried income is inherently volatile over time the potential for meaningful incentive income does help support the firms credit profile on may   apollo accessed the public debt markets for the second time issuing  million of notes that mature in  with a coupon of  and  million of the proceeds were used to pay down the bank term loan while the remainder is expected to be used to boost liquidity and for general corporate purposes including the funding of share repurchases coinvestment commitments seeding new investments andor for opportunistic acquisitions which would be expected to contribute to febitda growth in  apollo also issued  million of secured term debt to fund the firms retained interest in its european clos at sept   total secured term debt for this purpose amounted to  million in late  apollo will also be subject to risk retention requirements in the us fitch would view a sustained increase in debt to fund risk retention negatively as it would increase the firms consolidated leverage ratio fitch believes risk retention is akin to coinvestments in managed funds and should be funded with repayments from legacy investments retained earnings andor available cash apollos leverage as measured by corporate debt divided by febitda was x at sept   on a ttm basis which was modestly above fitchs quantitative benchmark of xx for a category alternative ims fitch expects the firms leverage to decline to x over the medium term as incremental fees are earned from growth in faum fitch believes apollos liquidity profile is sound apollos cash balance amounted to approximately  million at sept   and availability on the corporate credit facility was  million claims on corporate liquidity include unfunded commitments to the various funds of approximately  million at q although fitch believes the company has significant discretion over the timing of funding commitments apollo distributed approximately  of its distributable earnings yeartodate in  which is at the high end of the peer group but fitch believes the firm could reduce its payout ratio to boost its liquidity profile as necessary in february  apollos board authorized the repurchase of up to  million in aggregate of class a shares including up to  million through a share repurchase and up to  million through a reduction of class a shares to be issued to employees to satisfy associated tax obligations in connection with the settlement of equitybased awards granted under the incentive plan apollo spent  million on share repurchases in the first nine months of  including openmarket repurchases and repurchase of shares issued to employees several peers have also established repurchase programs over the past year given unitprice underperformance fitch recognizes the potential accretion provided by the program and is comfortable with the targeted amount given the firms liquidity position the stable outlook reflects fitchs expectations that management will continue to generate stable management and advisory fees growretain faum through the raising of new and expansion of existing funds albeit at a much more
