over to todd richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer thank you jamison good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today we are pleased with how our business performed during the third quarter even in the face of the ftc litigation we saw growth across our cumulative ending member count and revenue this reinforces the strength of our brand and further validates that our differentiated services that protect consumers from identity theft are highly valued before i dive into the details of our third quarter i am pleased to announce that lifelock has reached agreement with both the staff of the federal trade commission and representatives of a national class of consumers on a comprehensive settlement resolving outstanding litigation relating to our past marketing representations and information security program these agreements are not yet final because the ftc staff recommendation to approve the settlement must still be approved by the commission itself and a federal judge and the class action settlement will require review and approval by the court it is important to note that the proposed ftc settlement does not require us to change our current products services or business and information security practices including in particular our current marketing and advertising practices in addition there is no evidence that lifelock has ever had its customers data stolen and the ftc has not alleged otherwise in light of these proposed settlements lifelock is accruing an additional  million in reserves bringing the total reserve amount to  million this includes a  million reserve for potential settlement with state attorneys general we look forward to turning the page on these issues we believe that these agreements are in the best interest of shareholders and if approved will eliminate significant uncertainty for lifelock id like to thank lifelocks employees for maintaining an unwavering focus on our mission to serve our customers as we address this matter in terms of the next steps for the proposed settlement the agreement we have reached with the ftc staff is subject to final approval by the ftc commission and the court this afternoon we have joined with the ftc in filing a joint motion with the court to stay the ftc litigation while our settlement goes through the process of obtaining approval from the commission and the court in terms of the class settlement the memorandum of understanding will be submitted for the judges preliminary approval and then would be subject to an objection period and hearing before gaining final approval because the commissions approval is still pending we cannot provide additional details at this time now let me turn my focus to our q results we are pleased that we were able to deliver our nd consecutive quarter of sequential growth in both revenue and cumulative ending members while we exceeded our guidance for the quarter as anticipated we did feel an impact from the ftc actions on both new member acquisition and retention rates our member retention rate declined slightly to  in the quarter from  in the second quarter this decline was primarily the result of a higher number of cancellations post the ftc announcement or the announcement of the ftc action our quarterly gross new member additions were over  of a million we did see some partners pull back or take a pause on some of their marketing initiatives and we also scaled back some of our marketing with partners impacting our overall member acquisitions we expect to see an ongoing impact over the next few quarters but are hopeful that the proposed ftc and class action settlements will enable us to more effectively engage with our partners an important part of our longterm growth we saw a continued pattern of strong adoption of our premium offerings with well over  of gross new members choosing either lifelock advantage lifelock ultimate or lifelock ultimate plus in the quarter this represents the th consecutive quarter that over  of gross new members selected one of our premium offerings on the enterprise side of the business we signed several new customers in the quarter including two large alternative lenders and one of the leading small business marketplace lenders in addition we expanded our relationships with several existing customers including one of our largest wireless carriers and two top  card issuers on the organizational front we are pleased to announce that marco wirasinghe joined the company in august as vice president of consumer applications marco is overseeing lifelocks mobile division focusing on new and existing products in the safety security and convenience space previously marco served at yahoo where he led product management in mobile we are also pleased that in august as we previously announced we were able to bring on bityotas team of development data experts who are focusing on building out our consumer products in summary while the last several months have been challenging with regulatory and legal distractions it remains clear to us that we provide highly differentiated value to our members and believe we can now turn our complete focus back on our mission protecting consumers from identity theft as a company we have scaled our leadership team with the addition of schwark satyavolu as our evp of product  technology and particularly in risk compliance and security with the addition of ignacio martinez as chief risk officer and neil daswani as chief information security officer we have also strengthened our board and governance with the addition of jaynie miller studenmund and the appointment of roy guthrie as lead independent director we remain committed to continually improving our security architecture operational processes and marketing practices we are in a strong financial position with ample cash balances and meaningful cash flow generation i would also like to take a moment to thank our dedicated team of employees who over the last few months have continued to focus on executing their responsibilities at the highest level for our valued members let me now turn the call over to chris to walk you through the financials christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks todd q total revenue was  million above our guidance of  million to  million and up  compared to the third quarter of  our consumer business continued to power the overall business growing  yearoveryear to  million gross new member adds during the quarter were  compared with  in the third quarter of last year as our yearoveryear gross new member growth was impacted by the ftc announcement in terms of the monthly average revenue per member for q we saw a  yearoveryear growth to  driven by the continued success of our premium products our retention rate was  compared to  in q of last year and  last quarter we had expected our retention rate to decline due to the ftc announcement and the low renewal rates of the large – for each business signed during the first half of  overall we are pleased with the loyalty of our members in the face of these headwinds revenue from the enterprise segment was  million up  sequentially and  yearoveryear as id analytics continues to make progress expanding the breadth and depth of its network before i move down the income statement i wanted to preface my comments by stating that my commentary will be focused on adjusted results which for the quarter exclude a total of  million of share compensations expense  million of amortization of acquired intangible assets  million in cost associated with the ftc litigation and  million of acquisitionrelated expenses in addition we are excluding  million from the proposed settlement with the ftc and class action including a  million reserve for potential settlement with the state attorneys general adjusted gross margins grew by  basis points yearoveryear to  this was the ninth quarter in a row with a yearoveryear improvement of over  basis points as we continued to see scale benefits from both our data partners and our infrastructure investments adjusted sales and marketing expenses were  million in the period compared to  million in q of last year this produced a cost of acquisition in the quarter of  compared to  in q of  as reflected in our prior guidance we saw a significant impact to our marketing effectiveness and coa post the announcement of the ftc litigation in addition some strategic partners reduced marketing initiatives in light of the ftc announcement we continue to believe that the market opportunity is large and growing that is important to invest to drive awareness and growth for the longterm with our strong retention rate and the continued market acceptance of our premium products the lifetime value of our members remains healthy and validates the investment even at these coa levels adjusted technology and development expenses were  million in the quarter up from  million in the year ago period ongoing investments in product enhancements security infrastructure and market research also contributed to the increase and as we have discussed you should expect us to continue on this path of investment adjusted ga expenses were  million in the quarter compared to  million in the year ago period as a reminder our adjusted ga expenses now exclude costs associated with the ftc and related matters overall adjusted net income increased nearly  to  million in the third quarter compared to adjusted net income of  million in the year ago period adjusted net income per share in the third quarter was  based on  million shares compared to an adjusted income per share of  based on  million shares in q of last year this was above the high end of our guidance of adjusted net income per share of  to  adjusted ebitda was  million in q driven by strong revenue performance compared to our  million in the third quarter of  this was also above the high end of our guidance range cash flow from operations for the quarter were  million compared to  million in the third quarter of last year after taking into consideration  million of capital expenditures and the cash impact of  million in ftc litigation expenses this drove free cash flow of  million these results compare to  million of capex and free cash flow of  million in the year ago period free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by the  million bityota acquisitionrelated expenses and lower gross new member additions which affected deferred revenue we ended the third quarter with  million in cash and marketable securities compared to  million at the end of the second quarter our quarter ending cash balance was impacted by  million we paid to acquire the team from bityota we expect to use cash from our balance sheet to pay for the proposed settlement turning to our fourth quarter and full year guidance as todd mentioned the impacts from the ftc on gross new member additions and retention rates are expected to continue for a few more quarters and will have an impact on our reported results in addition as we turn the page and move forward we plan to continue to invest in security and product development to ensure that we provide the best protection to our members we also look to maintain our strong brand advantage through continued spend in marketing we believe these are the right steps to take for our longterm success its also important to note that from a highlevel perspective we remain positive about our longterm prospects and that we will move past the current impacts to our business over time we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet and we continue to expect the company to generate meaningful revenue growth cash flow and profitability going forward with that background we are updating our full year  guidance as follows we are raising our total revenue guidance which is now expected to be in the range of  million to  million above our previous range of  million to  million adjusted net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of  to  based on approximately  million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared to our most recent guidance of  to  this guidance assumes a  cash tax rate adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of  million to  million compared to our prior guidance of  million to  million free cash flow is expected to be in the range of  million to  million compared to our prior range of  million to  million as a result of the  million in acquisition cost and the impact to deferred revenue from lower gross new member additions for the december quarter we are initiating guidance as follows total revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of  to  based on approximately  million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding and finally adjusted ebitda is expected to be in the range of  million to  million in summary were pleased to have reached a proposed settlement with both the ftc and consumer class we continue to perform well under difficult circumstances further reinforcing the value that lifelock delivers to consumers our entire management team and employee base are focused on delivering an outstanding service to our members and with that we like to open the call up for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin our questionandanswer session the first question comes from david hynes of canaccord please go ahead david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc hey thanks guys good news in the settlement a couple of questions along those lines todd how would you handicap the likelihood of this settlement being final is it  likely is it  likely just help us think about the possibility of outcomes from here richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah while i wouldnt put a percentage on it i would certainly tell you we dont have any reason to believe that the commission or the court would not approve the proposed settlement that we worked so closely with staff and the plaintiff attorneys to arrive at david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc okay got it and then with the additional reserves which i guess now comes to a total of  million does that cover the entirety of the proposed agreedupon settlement richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer well certainly for this reserve were taking into account the agreedupon terms of both the class and the ftc settlement and then we place the reserve of  million of that with potential conclusion with the state attorneys general so we have executed the proposed agreements thatll have to be approved but of course our reserving practices are consistent with all that gaap accounting rules and beyond that because well have to wait for the commissions approval i really cant give you more details on that david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc okay and then i guess you guys really havent talked about the details of the investigation or the litigation at all the question we got if youre willing to pay  million  as a settlement theres clearly some admission of guilt somewhere along the lines that begs the question what was lifelock guilty of and what has changed since then that kind of rectifies the current business practices which you say were obviously unaffected richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer well i would just reiterate that while this agreement does not require lifelock to admit or deny anything – and from a wrongdoing perspective it doesnt require us to change any of our current practices too so whether thats products services business and information security but most in particular our current marketing and advertising practices require no changes david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc yeah got it okay thats helpful on ftc stuff maybe just one fundamental and then ill pass the line can you talk about kind of q marketing plans now that this is in the rear view of the particular channels that you plan to pursue more aggressively or historically q has been a period where youve reined back a bit on marketing spend does that change at all with the timing of the resolution here or just how youre thinking about that hilary a schneider  president yeah this is hilary as we look at q i would say you wont see any material changes in terms of the mix recognize then it each quarter we are experimenting and documenting what we can do as we think about incrementally improving our overall app efficiency and effectiveness and we will continue to invest in q david e hynes  canaccord genuity inc got it okay thank you guys for all the color appreciate it richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer thanks cj sic david operator the next question comes from nandan amladi of deutsche bank please go ahead nandan g amladi  deutsche bank securities inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question so i guess further on this settlement since youve agreed that theres no change necessary to your marketing and product practices where do you now focus your rd efforts as well as your security efforts youve touched on this a little bit in the script but perhaps you can provide a little more detail on where your dollars are going to be focused heading into  christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks nandan i would tell you that weve made these investments along the way so again id reiterate where you really see it most investing in the caliber of the talent that we brought onto the organization as i mentioned in the names in the beginning of the call the schwark satyavolus the neil daswanis the ignacio martinez really allowing us to look at both our product the technologies and our overall practices all those allow us that in conjunction with of course ty shay who came on early in the year as our chief marketing officer were really excited to allow everybody to go focus back on product development really responding to the consumers needs and continue to elevate our position as the premier product in the category richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer and nandan i think id add to that is i think weve said for quite a while that technology development which is where our product and infrastructure and security investments are is one of the line items that youre not going to see scale so i dont think this is necessarily a major shift but nonetheless a continuation of a trend of us looking to continue to invest in these areas nandan g amladi  deutsche bank securities inc thank you richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator the next question comes from scott zeller of needham  company please go ahead scott zeller  needham  co llc hi good afternoon congratulations on a strong performance in the headwinds regarding the news of the ftc can you help us understand the language thats being used so im looking on the business wire and theyre using the words preliminary settlement right now and as i look at your press release i think the word used is agreement so can you help us with which terminology we should be using to describe the discussions youve had richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah the key to that scott is while were in agreement with the ftc staff and with the class action attorneys it wont be final until the ftc staff recommendation to approve those settlements is formally approved by the commission itself and then of course the class action settlement will require review and approval by a court so were all in agreement on those terms the staff is making the recommendation to the commissioners to approve this agreement but it needs to complete its process thats why other people talk about pending scott zeller  needham  co llc okay and can you tell us which group actually took the action to go to court was it the ftc staff or was it the commission leaders that made that decision to move to go into court richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer well what i would tell you is they work on their side while we had fully anticipated reaching some sort of agreement previously unfortunately we just were unable to do that so both sides at that point in time could not arrive at amenable results for both and so the next process the next step in the process was the starting of the litigation but of course now were extremely pleased that we were able to reach that agreement find amendable terms to both sides and be able to put this matter hopefully very soon behind us scott zeller  needham  co llc okay and can you tell us whats changed now you referenced before the earlier negotiations youd had with the agency todd whats different now from when you last accrued for what you thought was going to be a settlement at that time versus this discussion now and your decision to accrue again can you describe the difference in those conversations and what gives you greater confidence now richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer well certainly one key element is that this is a comprehensive settlement so not just with the staff of the ftc but also to include this class action that was being taken that actually has even some broader time period and a broader audience to it so the fact that we can bring all of that together into the comprehensive settlement that we announced today thats the key difference in this resolution than what we have been talking about previously scott zeller  needham  co llc okay and then one question on the fundamentals when you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the impact to partners and i think you used the word pause what does that essentially do for those of us on the other end of the line here in the field does that mean that as partners take a pause the burden has increased on lifelock to drive more traffic more leaves et cetera and thats why we saw the cost of acquisition increase because the burden was increasingly on you to spend rather than partners richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer well i think for both the burden is really on us that we want to make sure that were a great partner to them and that theres no again uncertainty in the market or what lifelock – what were producing and at what caliber we can deliver that so this would really allow us to give certainty to our partner channels as they launch their marketing campaigns as they talk to their populations that respect them and have an affinity to those groups they can speak confidently about lifelock who we are and with certainty that we brought this matter to a closure and there is hopefully not going to be any unexpected surprises associated with the future so to continue to reinforce their confidence in us scott zeller  needham  co llc so just to clarify that pause did not mean an increase in spend out of your own pocket necessarily it was more of a waiting for them to feel comfortable working with lifelock richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah and to launch campaigns that may have been planned so some of the things that may have been considered in the works some of our partners may have decided to pause to get that better certainty in the market before they launched marketing campaigns on their behalf scott zeller  needham  co llc great thank you christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks scott operator the next question comes from scott shiao of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead scott s shiao  bank of america merrill lynch hi so i wanted to ask about the gnms the lower gnms during the quarter was it more because of the partners pulling back that sort of effect or is it the overall kind of effect that the advertising was lower christopher g power  chief financial officer it was actually a combination of the two but the actually impact from the partners was the larger of the two impacts as todd referenced in his answers to the questions and his prepared remarks we did had some of those partners pull back some perhaps delay some various marketing programs we did see an impact to direct marketing side as well but the larger impact was on the partner side of the business scott s shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay and how long do you see this effect persisting christopher g power  chief financial officer i think its a situation where were going to first of all these partners need to get comfortable with our settlement and as we said its going to take a few quarters as we continue to gain that confidence back and those partners continue to look to invest with us as well as convincing new partners to come onboard so we think that this is a very very positive first step in that process scott s shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay got it and so then the mix – and then you also mentioned  of the gnms were premium was that due more to advantage or ultimate plus christopher g power  chief financial officer i think weve continued to see the trend thats been consistent since we launched the products back over a year ago which is that first of all over  mark we continue to the above those levels and were very pleased in spite of the fact that we raised the prices relative to the prior products by about  dollars per month each so even with those increases we continue to see over  and we continue to see the trend that there are more ultimate plus than advantage within that premium mix scott s shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay and then the last question i had was that you mentioned that that ltv customers had changed i guess its presumed a little bit lower are we thinking  lower  how do we go about thinking about how the ltv – how the customers have changed christopher g power  chief financial officer i think the overall ltv i think what you saw is just a continuation first of all of the growth in arpu which were very pleased with how consistently weve been able to drive that arpu up over time its been  or more on a yearoveryear basis for over five years now so certainly as those premium products continue to penetrate the base well continue to see the lifetime value of our members moving up there was a slight impact as we mentioned in terms of the retention rate being slightly lower overall but certainly more than offset by the increase in arpu i think where you would see it is in the coa that we reported and a piece of that is the fact that partner channel where we saw a little bit of a larger impact is typically the lower coa channel and so when we see a little lower performance or a little lower growth within that channel that tends to take the overall coa up over time but in terms of the ltv of the members we are continuing to be very very pleased with the unit economics that weve been able to exhibit and we really havent seen a big change from an ltv perspective scott s shiao  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks for taking the questions christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks scott operator the next question comes from dan bergstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead dan bergstrom  rbc capital markets llc hi thanks for taking my questions thats great news that theres no changes in the marketing message no changes are needed there that being said how is the marketing message evolved what are you emphasizing more than before perhaps where you see it going hilary a schneider  president yeah so we do continue to test and iterate our marketing message you may have noticed we have a new long form tv commercial in the marketplace in that we really are emphasizing the complete nature of what identity theft protection means from the alerting all the way through the remediation in terms of the idea that you are fully protected we have based some of the changes in our messaging around our latest consumer research in terms of where there may be confusion in the marketplace and helping people once again understand what identity protection really means in its complete nature which just to remind you we are the marketleading brand and we want to continue to educate the market to bring them along as their awareness of issues arise and theyre looking for solutions dan bergstrom  rbc capital markets llc thanks and then perhaps could you talk a little bit more about the bityota team acquisition and what they are bringing to the table hilary a schneider  president absolutely were absolutely thrilled to be onboarding the bityota team that is a team as weve talked about our investments as we continue to differentiate ourselves as a productdriven company that really understands the consumer needs that bityota team in particular has expertise in large scale data processing so as you think about the massive amounts of data that we bring together and that we then create platforms in order to alert consumers effectively and quickly its really around thinking about scaling our abilities and coming up with new ways to surprise and delight our customers dan bergstrom  rbc capital markets llc thank you richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer thanks dan operator the next question comes from joe maxa of dougherty  company please go ahead joe maxa  dougherty  co llc thank you and also congrats on that initial agreement i was wondering if you could give us a little color on how the business has looked in q so far as compared to q has it improved has it got worse has it maybe i am thinking maybe improved after the initial new ftc lawsuit christopher g power  chief financial officer so i dont think were prepared to comment on performance in the quarter so far certainly thats reflected in our guidance overall and given that its been about  minutes since we announced the settlement i think well take a little more time to kind of gauge where were going overall with that joe joe maxa  dougherty  co llc okay and then on this proposed or potential settlement do you have a idea how long that may take to become final with kind of a best guess or timeframe that youre thinking about richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well thats probably really a question for the commission so we have every hope that the settlement will be approved and we hope it will be done expeditiously but its our understanding that in the general course the ftc approval process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months joe maxa  dougherty  co llc okay so perhaps by yearend richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer perhaps and certainly we hope it expeditiously joe maxa  dougherty  co llc yeah okay thanks guys christopher g power  chief financial officer thanks joe operator the next question comes from robert breza of wunderlich securities please go ahead rob breza  wunderlich securities inc hi and again congratulations on getting this milestone put behind you just quickly todd i think – how do you think about the enterprise business obviously maybe some of the enterprise customers were reluctant to or in your words paused how should we think about the enterprise growth going forward into next year richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer yeah so i certainly think weve been able to still announce even through this process growth with partnership new signing weve seen nice growth on the employee benefit side of the world with both broker networks and employer groups that are choosing lifelock in this age of the mega data breach were certainly seeing that kind of interest so we see this as being a critical part of our longterm strategy and i think now that weve been able to address this give certainty to the market it will really allow them to focus on whats the next marketing campaigns what can we go do together to allow some of the folks who are evaluating lifelock as a partner to be able to make those decisions with certainty in the market and without the overhang that weve had to date rob breza  wunderlich securities inc great and then maybe one quick followup question chris how should we think about the customer acquisition cost i mean as we think about it maybe yearonyear or quarteronquarter going forward i would assume we should start to expect that trend to come down a little bit but could you just talk generally to how the trend should be around customer acquisition cost christopher g power  chief financial officer sure rob so first of all id just remind everybody we do manage the business by lifetime value right so the cost of acquisition is really going to be driven by the quality of the members were bringing on board and clearly a higher ltv member wed be willing to pay a higher coa so were always going to have a level of variability associated with coa kind of from a quartertoquarter basis based on the mix of the types of members were bringing on board but we would as we discussed with seeing the partner channel will take a little bit of time to fully return to the levels that weve seen and as a result since that is typically the lower cost of acquisition channel that will likely take us a few quarters to work through the system rob breza  wunderlich securities inc great thanks christopher g power  chief financial officer thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to todd davis for closing remarks please go ahead richard todd davis  chairman  chief executive officer thank you and i

davis social security number customers pay  to  a month for the supposed protection — and for lifelocks  million guarantee if the protection failson one lifelock web page wwwtodddavislifelockcom

evidence shows that he shouldnt be the slightest bit confident in lifelocks ability to protect his name or personal datain june  in the wake of a new times article that exposed how lifelock was founded with lies news leaked that davis had become the victim of identity theft a man in texas had used davis id to take out a  loan and davis didnt know about it until the unpaid account went to a collection agencyin the following months davis and lifelock worked hard to spin the story into something positive davis claimed in an interview with msnbc in may  that the texas incident was the one and only time anything like that had ever happened to himanother lifelock page dedicated to todd davis wwwlifelockcomtodddavis claimed until it like the other davis page was removed by lifelock on may  following inquiries by new times that davis has looked to lifelock for protection after an identity theft    but only once and lifelock was there to helpnew times has learned though that the texas incident wasnt a flukein october  a few months after news broke that davis had become a victim someone in albany georgia opened an att wireless account using davis personal info a chandler police report shows see the pdf version of the reportas todd davis tried to deflect the bad press in the wake of the texas crime the albany resident was racking up hours on a cell phone in davis nameby the time att cut off the person he or she had amassed a large unpaid bill the amount with which att was stuck wasnt disclosed but in the fall of  the phone company authorized a collection agency to try to recover a  debtthats when lifelock and davis finally learned of the thefta lifelock employee reported the identity crime to chandler police on november   while todd davis was traveling out of stateafter a short time on the case chandler forwarded it to police in the georgia city which still is still investigating phyllis banks a spokeswoman for the albany agency tells new times that investigators went to the address listed on the bill and interviewed a local woman but no arrests had been madewhen albany investigators phoned davis about the crime last year they were very familiar with him and how hed publicized his social security number she saysits unfortunate he chose to conduct business in that way banks says its not fair to att because theyre losing a pretty substantial amount of moneyyet att wasnt the only company getting screwed by lifelocks advertising scheme — because plenty more criminals have made use of davis datarecords show that lifelock representative tamika jones called the chandler pd again in february  to report a slew of fraudulent accounts opened in davis nameas with the att account the amounts owed on the fraudulent accounts were not revealed in the police report — only the amounts sought by various companies and collection agencies listed below because these companies often forgive or waive a percentage of the bills of debtors the dollar amount of the losses could easily be highermore cellphone service was fraudulently charged to davis someone opened a verizon account in new york leaving behind unpaid bills of at least an account at centerpoint energy a texas utility was opened at least  went unpaidfake davises owe  to credit one bank and  to swiss colony a giftbasket companytwo other accounts one for usa savings bank and a gap credit card were opened successfully in davis name but showed zero balances as of early there were also multiple dings by collection agencies bay area credit  two for associated credit services  and  and two for enhanced recovery corporation  and  finally there was a ncofin  collectionagency account for  which could be the att bill considering the identical amount full details as to what happened with these accounts could not be obtained from davis but its clear that criminals in different locales have used davis id to obtain a host of loans goods and servicesdavis personal id hasnt been merely abused since he began advertising his ssn — its been gangrapedcounting the texas incident hes been a victim at least  times since more such incidents may exist — davis should know how many he could reveal his credit reports from the past few years if he wanted customers to know the truth but lifelock refused to discuss davis role as a frequent identitytheft victim or answer any other questions from new times for this storythe fact that davis has fallen victim to so many con artists illustrates how lifelock cannot steel anyone from identity theft even with new features intended to improve upon lifelocks original service the company failed to save the boss identity from getting used over and over againand as davis insisted on the companys web site lifelock customers can expect the same protection he himself has receivednew times may  story linked above showed how the company used deception and fear to drum up business lifelocks cofounders richard todd davis and robert j maynard jr told reporters across the country that maynard had once spent a week in the maricopa county jail falsely accused of crimes because his identity had been stolen the  incident was the inspiration for the company they saidofficial records and interviews with authorities in nevada proved the story a fable maynard had been arrested and jailed here all right — because hed failed to pay back a  gambling marker at the mirage casino in las vegas like bouncing a check thats a crime nevada authorities dropped the charges after maynard from his cell managed to scrape together the cashthe article also revealed that maynard the valley businessman who was principally behind lifelock during its  inception was banned for life in the s from the creditrepair industrythen there was this ironic tidbit maynards own father valley optometrist robert maynard sr accused him of identity theftmaynard jr resigned from the company that june right about the time news broke of the  loan taken out in davis name before the summer of  lifelock had received barely a word of negative press since then though criticism and legal problems have plagued the company on a number of fronts — fueled partly by lifelocks incessant inyourface or ears since the firm does lots of radio advertisinga followup article in new times blasted the identitytheftprotection industry itself as a racket and gave examples of bogus claims put out by lifelock blog sites and media outlets scrutinized lifelocks ads and scolded davis over the  loan from texasthere were many arguably excellent reasons not to sign up for lifelock critics noted one of the strongest being that anybody with average intelligence and a computer can perform its most touted service setting fraud alerts on a personal credit file for free in minutes supposed insiders also claimed lifelocks customer data wasnt secure putting customers at risk of the very sort of crime lifelock purports to preventlawyers began drawing up classaction lawsuits for aggrieved customers and experian one of the big three national credit bureaus sued lifelock in early  over its abuse of a federal law set up to help consumersthe federal trade commission despite agreeing with new times that a case of false advertising could possibly be made on the story of maynards jailing did nothing at the time neither did state arizona attorney general terry goddardmeanwhile lifelock founded with millions of dollars in seed money from venture capitalists like bessemer venture partners and goldman sachs kept pumping out ads that grew its customer base to amazing heightsdespite naysayers questions lifelock boasted in may  that it had signed up its millionth customer lifelock was — and remains — a cash machinesuch phenomenal success helped the company weather its two biggest legal challenges the first in october  when the company settled with experian and agreed to stop setting fraud alerts on behalf of its customers the second when the ftc hit lifelock with the  million penaltythough the ftc took all the cash lifelock had on hand the settlement didnt stop investors from reenergizing the company with millions of dollars in new capitalfrom the start one of lifelocks strengths has been its aggressive marketing campaign and the result hasnt just meant customers lifelock has wormed its way into americana holding itself up as a beacon of identitytheft awareness and education its bought its way onto race cars the jerseys of the phoenix mercury and onto the signage at us airways arena where the mercury and phoenix suns play davis and lifelocks marketers likened to con artists by the ftcs chairman have even ingratiated themselves with law enforcement agencies around the country using their illgotten gains to help pay for identitytheft summits the arrangements give lifelock the legitimacy it seeks to counter the claims of consumer advocatestheyve successfully put the good before the bad says robert siciliano a boston author and speaker on identitytheft issues thats a strategy that many politicians have perfected its one lifelock has done well with alsothe ftc settlement is supposed to prevent the company from lying about the effectiveness of its service but theres a fine line in american advertising as to such things authorities vow to keep monitoring lifelock in turn lifelock will probably try to keep refining its advertising messages — as in the examples of the web pages taken down after questions by new times — until it drops off the ftcs radaryet robert j maynards brainchild thrives mainly because it misrepresents the truth it has to otherwise no one would believe it could keep his or her identity safe the fundamental concept that drives customers to lifelockeven after it was toned down the false promise of effective protection against identity theft remains integral to lifelocks advertising lifelocks modus operandi appears based on one of sun tzus maxims in the art of war deception is everythingwhen lifelock began in  its founders pushed for all the free publicity they could get in the news media maynard and davis misrepresented the facts about the founders jail stint implying that the same thing could happen to people who dont try to protect themselves and they lied about the level of prevention the company could offerwe prevent id theft from ever occurring davis told the phoenix business journal in then they hit upon a unique idea for a major advertising campaign in early  davis maynard and mike prusinski the companys spokesman and vice president of communications began giving out their social security numbers to the presswisely prusinski and maynard quit the practice early on but davis put his ninedigit number on a flatbed truck using the image in ads nationwide while claiming that lifelock made his personal data useless to criminalsads emphasized the guarantee claiming that lifelock would cover all losses and expenses up to  millionthe claims were bogus savvy folks could see right through themin the terms of the guarantee if potential customers bothered to read them the company doesnt promise to pay anyone a dime thats if it covers a theft at all because the guarantee is full of exceptions for instance lifelock wont cover phishing scams or other popular ways to steal identities that involve duping someone into releasing personal datathe company agreement says if you become a victim because of a failure or defect in the services lifelock will retain and pay for those third party professional services that are reasonably necessary in lifelocks judgment to assist you in restoring losses or recovering your lost outofpocket expenses caused by such fraudconsider the phrase reasonably necessary in lifelocks judgment for instancecustomers and noncustomers complained in may  lawyers in new jersey filed the first classaction lawsuit against lifelock not only was the service a useless waste of money the suit alleged but the constant setting of fraud alerts harmed customers credit scorescredit bureau experian beat the class to court in a lawsuit filed in february  experian ripped lifelock for its misleading marketing campaign but aimed primarily to kill lifelocks fraudalert featureas mentioned lifelocks main service until last august was to set fraud alerts on consumers credit files the alerts are like red flags in the computer files of the big three credit bureaus experian transunion and equifaxif a thief tries to open a line of credit the company offering the new account will stumble on the alert when it runs a credit report that in turn should mean the thiefs attempt to open the new account gets thwartedlifelocks main service used to be placing such a red flag on credit files for each of its customers every  days as its customer base grew by tens then hundreds of thousands in  and  lifelock became a burden and a competitor to experiannot that the credit bureaus deserve much sympathy but experian ended up stuck with a sizable unfunded mandate because of the way lifelock exploited the lawwhen a person requests a fraud alert with one of the bureaus the fair and accurate credit transactions act requires the bureau to not only place the alert on file but to notify the other two bureaus about it the law allows only individuals not companies to call for the alerts but lifelock and one of its competitors texasbased debix put the law to the testlifelock called experians fraud hotline up to  times a day to request fraud alerts the credit bureaus suit alleged lifelock apparently used experians system the most because it was more convenient and every time the company called experians tollfree number experian was charged about  cents its lawyers claimedthe wily lifelock began by calling thousands of times a day from a canadian phone number when the credit bureau struck back blocking calls from the number lifelock began using numbers in pennsylvania to make the bulk calls every time the credit bureau tried to stem lifelocks calls the company switched its outgoing phone banksexperians chief competitors transunion and equifax werent antilifelock they even helped lifelock launder some of the fraud alerts that experian had to deal with the suit statedno doubt much of experians problem with lifelock had to do with experians running its own identitytheft protection racketin  experian was slapped with a  penalty by the ftc for its misnamed wwwfreecreditreportcom web site which duped people into buying an expensive creditmonitoring service and lured away consumers from the governments real free credit report web site wwwannualcreditreportcomat one point during the antitrust trial held in santa ana california experian lawyer thomas malcolm admitted that experians sister company cic aka freecreditreportcom even issued hundreds of fraud alerts for its customers between august  and february  — until experians legal department got wind of the program and shut it downexperian doesnt compete with lifelock malcolm argued experian is being essentially bludgeoned to death — bloodied — by lifelock on a daily basislifelocks lawyer contended that cic issued fraud alerts until the month that experian filed its lawsuit experian was just sore that its fraudalert service hit the market too late and failed from lifelocks point of viewdespite experians apparent hypocrisy us district judge andrew guilford ruled in may  that lifelocks practice of setting the alerts for customers was illegal lifelock halted the practice a few months later as part of its settlement with experian debix dropped its fraud alerts toothe weirdest part of all this was that lifelocks deception ran so deep that its target audience barely noticed what happenedsince its inception the company had emphasized that the feature that made it different than competitors — the service that was the very backbone of lifelocks idtheft protection — was that it set fraud alerts for customersafter lifelock lost the suit to experian and the fraud alerts were stopped the company claims it went from  million customers in late  to  million as of this yearlifelocks customers arguably a gullible group to begin with must be asleep at the switch a few months after the experian settlement lifelock settled complaints about its advertising practices with the ftc and  state attorneys generalftc chairman jon leibowitz flew to chicago to make the march  announcement alongside illinois ag lisa madigan who had spearheaded the authorities effort arizona ag terry goddard merely was one of the  though the company is a short drive from his officein a madefortv quote leibowitz referenced one of davis advertising stunts and told reporters the protection lifelock actually provided left such a large hole in it that you could drive a truck right through italthough lifelock customers received some benefits they were far too few to justify the monthly fee of  leibowitz saidlifelock was ordered to pay  million to the states and  million to the feds to be used for customer refunds and consumer education the actual settlement was for  million but the ftc agreed to take just what lifelock had in the bank at the time an avalanche clause would be triggered if the government found out lifelock had more cash stuffed in some secret accountbut there was no prohibition against taking in new funds from investorsalthough lifelock was a con the company would be allowed to stay in business leibowitz saidleibowitz said at the time that lifelocks marketers had changed their business model to some extent and going forward it is far more within the realm of a legitimate business model with honest advertising to consumersbesides the  million payment the ftc order requires lifelock to be truthful in its marketing claims and to develop a datasecurity programlifelock had all but the left the door wide open for a severe data breach a lack of security for its customers data that was especially shameful for a company that claimed to prevent identity theft leibowitz said david lincincum a staff attorney with the ftc tells new times that the order also called for davis to pay  personally for his role in the schemethe government negotiated a separate settlement with maynard who left lifelock in june  that didnt require a payment from the cofounderstill the order bans maynard from conning people through any datasecurity or identitytheft service he may start up in the future lincincum says if hes in charge of data security anywhere a third party has to audit his workof course the  ftc order banning maynard for life from the creditrepair industry didnt stop him from launching lifelock which purports to help people fix problems with their credit files lincincum doesnt have much of an answer for why maynard wasnt dealt with more harshly this time aroundwe obviously are not thrilled to see someone a second time he says drily at the end of the day we had to make a decision the ftc settlement also is taking care of the dozen classaction lawsuits against lifelock that amassed in various states over time as of last august the suits had been consolidated and a valley firm hagens berman sobol shapiro was handling the caserob carey a partner in the firm and one of the lead lawyers in the case says the class action will go away because of the settlement but that individual plaintiffs can opt out and sue on their ownthe consolidated action had asked for an end to the fraud alerts which has already happened thanks to the experian suit and demanded that lifelock tell customers explicitly that the  million guarantee doesnt cover payment of losses because of identity theftsome lifelock clients were under the impression that the company would not only help them repair their credit but would also make them whole for their losses — only to find out that the company had misled thema ruling by us district judge mary murguia on attorney fees in the various lawsuits is due by july — carey says the amount lifelock will have to pay should be no more than  million to be split among the lawyersformer and current lifelock customers can apply for refunds by contacting the ftc see wwwftcgovlifelock or by waiting to receive an ftc letter stating theyre eligible for refunds theres no predicting how many customers will ask for their money backthe ftc settlement was embarrassing for at least two of the  participating state attorneys general thanks to lifelocks partnership with the national law enforcement executive development association known as fbileedathe yearold fbileeda based in malvern pennsylvania helps educate cops in the latest crimefighting trends and keeps them plugged in with veterans and specialists its affiliated with the fbi to an extent an fbi liaison to the associations executive board currently agent charles robb jr gets paid by the bureau for his work with the association robb didnt respond to a request for an interviewthe nonprofit organization has two premiere level sponsors purdue pharma and lifelock the tempe company pays  a year for the honor according to fbileedas web site lifelock makes dupont maker of kevlar scottsdalebased taser international and glock — who sponsor at the platinum gold and bronze levels respectively — look cheapfor the past couple of years lifelock also has sponsored highprofile idtheftfocused training seminars with fbileeda paying for keynote speakers continental breakfasts and box lunches for hundreds of attendees the organizations executive director tom stone supports lifelock wholeheartedlystone tells new times that lifelock pays all that money to fbileeda because as a corporate citizen they are giving something back to the communitythe former chief of police from virginia emphasizes that the ftcs settlement was a civil not criminal penalty he dismisses concern about the companys reputation saying he has no response to the ftcs findingsim not going to attempt to go there stone huffs as far as what happened with the ftc and anything civilly its not within my purviewtaking lifelocks money though is apparently within his purviewfor other government law offices the relationship with lifelock has soured after the ftc actionthe first fbileedalifelock summit following the ftcs march announcement about lifelock was on april  in charlotte north carolinaan fbileeda flier said the event would be hosted by north carolinas charlottemecklenburg police department and its police chief rodney monroemonroe had been scheduled to speak at the summit but his planned participation irked north carolina attorney general roy cooper one of the officials who had gone after lifelock cooper called monroe the week before the summit and asked him not to go says charlottemecklenburg police sergeant walter bowling the chief acquiesced and skipped the summit it was out of respect for the ags office bowling says there was some discomfort with chief monroe coming out putting his face out to itstone claims hes unaware that the chief ever was supposed to go to the summit or give a speech he notes that about  members of the charlottemecklenburg department still showed upbowling who helped organize his departments participation in the summit says he researched lifelock beforehand and decided the company was sincere about improving hes no apologist like stone admitting im not an idiot — i know they get some benefit from itcops benefited from the summit he adds by gaining valuable knowledge from the expert speakers on tackling identity crimes lifelocks funding helped make it happenits difficult in these economic times to find and attend training bowling writes in an emailnevadas another state whose lawenforcement connection to lifelock — in light of the recent ftc ruling — comes off as both ironic and hypocriticallast june the nevada attorney generals office cohosted one of the summits with fbileeda and lifelocknevadas ag catherine cortez masto smiles in a picture with todd davis taken at the event as if theyre the best of friends lifelock used the picture prominently on a web page about the summits — even after masto joined the ftc and the  other attorneys general in targeting the firm for legal actiona spokeswoman for the nevada attorney generals office edie cartwright says there are no plans to host another lifelocklinked summit she thanked new times for the headsup on the photograph of masto and daviswe did not realize that was on their site she said and they had not asked for permission so we requested that they remove it lifelock took down the picturethough appreciative at first cartwright became terse when asked whether masto could come to the phone to talk about the picture and past dealings with lifelocktheres no quote she said stiffly now a detour to waikikino story about lifelock would be complete without describing what happened to the charismatic veracitychallenged robert maynard jr after he resigned from lifelock maynards a fascinating character — a former marine brilliant ambitious to a fault and a sufferer of bipolar disorder and depressionnew times  article covered maynards background in detail the northern arizona university graduate emerged from a bankruptcy in the mids to become a millionaire as the head of the national credit foundation a shady creditrepair company but his overspending and risky investments had put him back into deep debt by  when he filed another bankruptcythough he had to leave lifelock well before its peak he reportedly retained a  percent equity in the firm lifelock put millions of dollars into maynards bank accountsthen maynard moved to hawaii in  and blew much — or possibly all — of his lifelock fortune on a failed oceanadventure business the business hired more than  people for a time but later left employees hanging without a final paycheckkandoo island as the venture was called sounded like great fun maynard and his partner dale smith bought a foot catamaran parked it in the water off waikiki beach and outfitted it with toys and amenities for touristsit was a highprofile move that attracted lots of local interest maynard told the press he planned to invest about  million in kandoo which would offer parasailing jetskiing scuba diving and other water sports to thrillseekers by the summer of when honolulu starbulletin reporter susan essoyan approached maynard last june for an interview the former phoenix resident talked about his past scandals he admitted that his creditrepair company had tried to take advantage of the system according to essoyans article chocking up his bad decisionmaking to youthful inexperiencehe also claimed the gambling spree which resulted in his unpaid casino marker in  was the result of electroconvulsive therapy in an unsuccessful bid to treat his depression the treatment gave him manic spells and memory loss essoyan reported he related how his marriage ended and that he attempted suicide in in  he began taking proper medications for his illness and turned his life around he told essoyan that was the year he founded lifelockthe starbulletin article seemed to contradict the accusation by maynards dad that his son had improperly taken out an american express card using the elder maynards ssn though robert maynard sr had confirmed in july  that new times had quoted him correctly in money for nothing the optometrist told the hawaii reporter that he and maynard jr had acquired the card together apparently father and son have mended fences maynard sr declined to comment for this articlethe coast guard cleared kandoo island to launch in early august of last year the big doo as maynard liked to be called at the time and his crew took customers out on the catamaran every day for about two weeks then the money stream ran dry maynard and smith had underfunded kandoo island and they couldnt make scheduled payments for the substantial insurance premiums required for the adventure businessjesse berbig  who worked as the kitchen manager feels raw about getting stiffed for about  in final wages he put in plenty of overtime working six or seven days a week he saysi did right by maynard all summer and now i cant get him on the phone berbig saysemails to the staff by maynard forwarded to new times by berbig show the former lifelock exec was struggling to find new funding within days of bringing the first customers on boardmoney has turned incredibly tight maynard wrote in an email to the krew as he called them on august  my family put every dollar literally that we had into getting this project ready more than double what we had plannedtwo financing deals fell through literally at the closing table he wrote we are in the crucible right now if you can make it along with us through this difficult time we will share in the rewards financiallyby august  maynard was apologizing for bounced checks telling his workers that it was absolutely mortifying to me that things got so out of control so fast heremaynard has been named in at least two lawsuits regarding kandoo in one the hawaii national bank seeks at least  million from another local business morning star cruises the bank wants to put maynard jr on the hook for  million of that stating in the action that maynard owes that amount to morning star for two smaller boats and ocean equipmentthe other lawsuit alleges that kandoo island failed to pay a  bill for maintenance on the catamaranreached by phone in hawaii maynard declined to discuss his financial situation saying its too personal he was friendly enough despite past avowals that he would never speak to this newspaper againduring the short conversation he was asked why he risked the money he had made from lifelock i got carried away he said i loved the idea and i ran out of moneyhe insists that berbig and any other kandoo employees who werent paid will eventually get that last paycheckand who knows with maynards record he could be sitting pretty again in a couple of years as long as he stays away from false advertising he may even keep the ftc off his back my name is montel williams the former talkshow host says on lifelocks home page lifelock offers me much more than identitytheft protection they give me true peace of mind dont let thieves take what you and your family have worked so hard forconsidering todd davis experience williams testimonial appears ludicrousyet williams quote captures part of the reason for lifelocks explosive growth and customer retentionits like retail therapy the important thing for customers is that they are paying for something that makes them feel good never mind that its a placebobut their peace of mind will indeed be shaken if they do fall victim if thieves use your personal data you will have to deal with it lifelock member or notnot only cant lifelock prevent identity theft it cant do so much for customers who get ripped off as the davis example shows lifelock members still have to deal with the problems any victim would facesurely davis peace of mind must have been shaken by his myriad experiences with identity thefthes gotten calls from collection agencies from police hes been asked to fill out forms and has had to work with his company and possibly the folks it hires because it cant do this stuff alone in an attempt to convince the credit bureaus that hes not the deadbeat theyre looking for its possible they might not believe him since he filed for personal bankruptcy in  before he was involved with lifelockthe ftcs settlement has not stopped lifelock from pushing its bogus message of protection and security on its web site or in its ads the prominent testimonials on lifelocks home page like the one from montel williams contain verbiage similar to catchphrases used in ads that the ftc says were misleadingfor instance the ftc expressed concern about this lifelock message in its march  news release do you ever worry about identity theft if so its time you got to know lifelock we work to stop identity theft before it happens compare that to ishana wieczerzaks testimonial displayed on lifelocks home page wieczerzak states that after a coworkers theft of her personal information to obtain a credit card protecting my identity    was a fulltime job i had enough so i found lifelock and now they help protect my identityits just a somewhat softer peddle of the same messageperhaps the old lifelock really offered a scintilla of protection as the ftc acknowledged its possible that putting your credit file in a permanent state of red alert might have prevented some newaccount crimes though doing so may also have reduced your credit score lifelocks critics contend but what about todays lifelock which no longer sets fraud alerts for its customersin the middle of last year lifelock unveiled a new service to replace the fraud alerts it really isnt that new lifelocks web site states that the better and broader identitytheft protection system will• use more sophisticated and more scientific algorithms to spot identity fraud• examine patterns over time across the entire network to help predict future identity risks and vulnerable members• mine more data sources than the credit bureaus including retailers banks mortgage lenders utilities and auto lendersthe phrase more sophisticated and more scientific algorithms suggests that lifelock already was employing algorithms — though lessscientific ones and what are algorithms anyway just a fancy term for a stepbystep problemsolving procedure according to one dictionary definitionthe other two bullet points sound just as vague and hokeyin april  lifelock rolled out a major new feature called erecon which supposedly trolls thousands of web sites used by hackers for signs of customers personal data the feature appears to have had little benefit for todd davis since it was in effect during the year that criminals repeatedly exploited his identitythe service that lifelock now provides seems so nebulous that customers ought to wonder whether they can qualify for the  million guarantee under any circumstances after all the guarantee is triggered only if lifelocks service fails or is defectivebefore if lifelock failed to place a fraud alert and a new account was opened in your name you qualified for the guarantee now judging by information lifelock puts out customers trying to take advantage of the guarantee must prove that lifelock failed to examine patterns over time or perhaps used an algorithm that wasnt scientific enougha testimonial used in the companys advertising from an alleged customer named gary johnson touches on this problemif i had joined lifelock sooner they would have alerted me when my personal information was used to apply for credit or services within their network johnson stateslifelock members would be wise to make the company spell out exactly what is within the companys network before signing up new times could find nothing on lifelocks web site that states what it considered inside or outside its networkcustomers may also want to inquire how many of the new accounts successfully opened in davis name would have fallen within this networklifelock claims that its new service provides better protection than everas davis should know this isnt saying much
