future financial performance that is different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap within the meaning of the applicable securities and exchange commission or sec rules  nsam believes this metric can be a useful measure of its performance which is further defined below cash available for distribution cad we believe that cad provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance management also uses cad among other measures to evaluate profitability in addition the incentive fees to which we are entitled pursuant to our management agreements with each of our northstar listed companies are determined using such northstar listed companys cad as a performance metric we believe that cad is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance such as transaction costs depreciation and amortization equitybased compensation unrealized gain loss on investments and other realized gain loss on investments and other and asset impairment  we adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance for instance these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments or restructuring of investments which are expenses related to specific transactions we calculate cad by subtracting from or adding to net income loss attributable to common stockholders noncontrolling interests attributable to the operating partnership and the following items equitybased compensation depreciation and amortization related items amortization of deferred financing costs foreign currency gains losses impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets straightline rent adjustments for joint ventures and investment funds unrealized gain loss from fair value adjustments realized gain loss on investments and transaction and other costs in future periods such adjustments may include other onetime events pursuant to changes in us gaap and certain other nonrecurring items these items if applicable include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes cad as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders cad should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss attributable to common stockholders determined in accordance with us gaap as an indicator of operating performance in addition our methodology for calculating cad involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies the following table presents a
