in a number of films alongside the most beautiful starletsbut his first love was barbara stanwyck an actress twice his age as his career blossomed and after he separated from stanwyck he met the woman who would change his life forever natalie wood they fell instantly and deeply in love and stayed together until the stress of their careershers marching upward his inexplicably deflatingdrove them to divorce trying to forget the pain he made more movies and spent his time in europe with the likes of steve mcqueen sophia loren peter sellers laurence olivier david niven liz taylor and joan collins

of humor and a great memory and stories of the old hollywood studio system x previous image next image verified purchase yes  condition preowned  sold by ernestjp   by treviglo apr   interesting and insightful i liked the book because it contained many behind the scenes stories and he was very honest both good and bad about the people that he knew and had worked with x previous image next image verified purchase yes  condition preowned  sold by wonderbooks   by joecant jan   good book fairly good book by a hollywood veteran a bit over the top and forced dramatic license where his female conquests are written of certainly a must read fir a wagner fan x previous image next image verified purchase yes  condition preowned  sold by ckin   by stephie sep   pieces of my heart very poorly written more likle a diary than any specific information disjointed as it hops from one place to another without any real tie together information nearly everyone has been wrong with the exception of him strange i had looked forward to reading his book and was disapointed with the contents and the way it was put together i worked in that town for more than  years and was in the entertainment industry for a significant amount of that time stories always circulated about the various personalities most of which were press agents dreams and he managed to stay clean of most until the later part of his career and then in an attempt to get a grater return for whatever he contributed to the entertainment he tried to get in on the financing and with poor business sence he ended up taking the people that he was involved with to courts in attempts to get more money than he was actually due tye result was his name gradually went down as far as being a nice guy i would not recommend his book to anyone that is looking for factual information or any real insite as to what made mr wagner run x previous image next image   by victoria may   not a great title or very appropriate to content if you grew up in the s youll enjoy this book lots of old hollywood references and stories felt it wasnt all that informative and that rj kept it superficial in many respects probably part of the reason he never become a bigtime movie star nice guy great father lotsa baggage sounds like most everyone x previous image next image   why is this review inappropriate it’s spam or has links there
