michael stein  welcome to my web page michael stein ralph and mary otis isham professor department of statistics and the college my research focuses on statistical models and methods for spatial and spatialtemporal processes in particular i am interested in the nature of the spatialtemporal interactions implied by these models and on developing statistical methods for assessing these interactions my main motivation for studying spatialtemporal processes is to describe variations in the physical environment in recent years most of my efforts in this direction relate to problems in climate and weather two topics of current interest are methods for combining output from deterministic climate models with observational data to produce realistic spatially and temporally resolved simulations of future temperature and precipitation fields and ways of estimating temperature extremes that take proper account of seasonality longterm trends and spatial structure climate datasets either computergenerated or observational are generally quite large leading to two major thrusts of my research first when one has lots of spatialtemporal data for the natural environment it is often apparent that the process is nonstationary in space time or both thus the development of nonstationary models plays a central role in my current research second when one has large datasets with complex dependencies computational issues are critical as they relate to evaluating likelihoods and running simulations much of my recent research has considered bringing to bear modern tools from numerical linear algebra to these computational problems last update      search    directories    statistics home    uchicago department of statistics   s university avenue  chicago il  uchicago®

when he was fifteen he enrolled into a drama class his first day of high school the first assignment was to write a conflict between two characters being a product of the s and a self proclaimed neurotic kid he wrote a scenario about a husband trying to convince his wife to leave the country due to early warning signs of a nuclear war despite classmate’s tilted heads and dropped jaws his drama teacher loved it after michael graduated high school he had no interest in going to college but he attended community college and took classes in three subjects that interested him psychology business and acting during the same period michael performed as a comedian in los angeles appearing at the comedy store laugh factory la cabaret and the improv in order to pay for his acting education michael started promoting nightclubs and became known as the leading nightclub promoter of the “young hollywood scene” with his club called “off the wall” at the same time michael organized and produced movie premiere promotions working closely with guber peters productions and rob friedman at the ripe old age of twenty one he then started studying with venerable acting coach and group theater disciple eric morris stein’s first role came when he was cast by his friend paul thomas anderson to play the lead role of dirk diggler in the original short film “the dirk diggler story” that later became the feature film “boogie nights” which michael appears in as well michael was inspired by paul thomas anderson’s success as a film maker when anderson landed his first film “hard eight” it motivated michael to leave his promotion business and become a full time production assistant in order to learn how to become a film maker stein worked on commercials music videos and films with directors such as zack snyder david dobkin tony kaye dave ramser and spike jonez and many others after several years of production work michael decided to write direct and produce a thirty minute dramatic short film “rituals and resolutions” the intense and intellectual film about infidelity and broken self promises won many festival awards including the two largest short film festivals at the time int short film festival oberhausen and the palm springs int film fest the film was then acquired and distributed by hbo films due to the success of “rit dixon kyle  stein michael  stranger things
