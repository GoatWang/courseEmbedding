founded by nav athwal realtyshares is a crowdfunding website for real estate developments that claims to help you diversify your portfolio and invest in prescreened and professionally managed residential commercial retail and mixeduse projects not only does realtyshares claim to help you purchase shares in private real estate investments but the company also claims to help companies access a new source of funding to raise capital for their investments how does realtyshares claim to work by now you’re almost certainly familiar with crowdfunding sites like kickstarter indiegogo gofundme and boostercom which help people raise money for their business ventures and personal needs using these websites all you have to do is list your project and if other people are interested in helping you out they can contribute as much money as they’re comfortable with recently though a new era of crowdfunding has entered the market with websites like realtyshares which claims to serve two primary purposes  to help accredited investors invest in a variety of real estate projects and  help companies fund their real estate projects without having to go through traditional banks or other large lenders since coming online in late  realtyshares has garnered quite a lot of media attention having been featured on the wall street journal forbes cnn money business times and more due in no small part to their claimed focus on helping individuals invest in real estate projects from their living rooms and giving them everything they need to invest intelligently in short realtyshares acts as a centralized area where companies who need funds for their private real estate projects can meet with investors who are willing to purchase shares in these projects and according to the company they give you the ability to make real estate investments in  simple steps sign up for a realtyshares account browse investments securely if you find one you’re interested in you’ll then be able to access a detailed page explaining the offering including “financials property information legal and financial documents and investment manager bios” finalize your investment directly through the realtyshares website the company even claims all documents can be signed electronically using docusign and funds can be transferred via balanced next each investment comes with a specific funding goal that must be met before you officially own a share while you’re waiting for this to occur your money will be held in an fdic insured escrow account and if this goal isn’t reached then  of your money will be refunded all realtyshares members have access to a personalized dashboard where you can monitor your investments and returns and manage your documents you’ll also receive quarterly updates about the project via email and tax documents are provided once per year you’ve worked diligently over the years to make smart investment decisions and this new breed of real estate crowdfunding websites has piqued your interest but you’re wondering if they’re ultimately worth your time or are just a passing fad after all you invest carefully and aren’t in the habit of losing your hardearned money but is realtyshares a company that you can count on to help you make wise investment decisions consider the following you have options when it comes to real estate investing first and foremost if you’re thinking about using a real estate crowdfunding website keep in mind that realtyshares isn’t your only option as other sites such as fundrise realty mogul crowdstreet collaperty and many more are vying for your business with this said according to realtyshares’ ceo the company differentiates itself from other real estate crowdfunding websites by offering lower fees complete transparency a seamless investment process and access to a wider range of investment opportunities how much risk are you willing to take on next like any other type of investment real estate projects come with a certain level of risk so you’re not guaranteed to make any money in fact in a worstcase scenario you could end up losing your entire investment also remember that real estate investments are not liquid which means that your money might be tied up for long periods of time as such you’ll need to thoroughly vet any investment you’re thinking about becoming involved with it realtyshares’ investor guidelines if you’re thinking about investing in a real estate project featured on realtyshares the most important thing you need to know is that you must be qualified as an accredited investor according to the realtyshares faq this means you must be “a natural person with  a net worth or joint net worth with the person’s spouse exceeding  million not including the value of the primary residence and  or  annual income of  in each of the two most recent years or joint income with a spouse exceeding  for those years and a reasonable expectation of the same income in the current year” on top of this you must have a minimum of  to contribute to a project although some investments may go as low as  there is no maximum investment amount and you can even qualify as a foreign investor realtyshares’ investment options if you qualify as an investor you’ll have two options debt investment and equity investment debt investment means that your contribution funds a loan for the company who’s responsible for the project and depending on your level of investment your portion of the money earned from monthly interest charges will be deposited into your account on the other hand an equity investment pays a percentage of cash flow from rent on a monthly basis or on the profits if the project is sold regardless of the type each investment will come with its own ‘hold period” which references the expected amount of time that will pass before investors recoup their money after a project has been paid off or sold this information will be available on the project’s investment overview page and can last anywhere from less than  months to more than  years realtyshares’ company guidelines according to the company’s website realtyshares only provides loans eg debt investments for  unit residential properties and some commercial properties such as apartment buildings specifically the website’s faq states projects must be cashflowingvalueadd equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investments in fix  flips located in high demandlow supply markets loans secured by residential and commercial real estate on top of this borrowers must have a minimum  credit score a loan to purchase price of less than  and an “estimated loan to after repair value once the property is rehabbed less than ” as such the realtyshares will not work for construction or groundup development projects on top of this realtyshares claims to closely screen all new projects prior to being listed including background and credit checks comps projected returns geography property type and quality investment structure a knowledgeable team and a proven track record although realtyshares doesn’t guarantee successful funding the company claims that most projects listed are funded within  days however for any projects listed on realtyshares companies will not be able to advertise them elsewhere in order to remain in compliance with regulation d rule b finally realtyshares’ funding methods are claimed to help you focus on operating the investment instead of communicating with numerous investors since all funds are pooled into a single llc the difference between realtyshares  reits when compared to reits real estate investment trusts realtyshares claims to give investors the ability to choose the specific type of property or groups of properties they’d like to invest in whereas reits traditionally only allow you to invest in specific asset classes or projects based on geography in addition realtyshares claims to charge substantially lower fees than reits we’ll talk more about this in a moment what are other investors saying about realtyshares realtyshares inc has only been in business since late  and there were no individual reviews available online at the time of our research however most professional reviews from large websites such as forbes and techcrunch seem to be favorable not just for realtyshares but for the growth of the real estate crowdfunding industry in general realtyshares pricing realtyshares is free to sign up for an account whether you’re an individual looking to invest or a company looking for funding however according to the company’s faq they “will charge a fee to cover ongoing investor reporting and communications for the investment” although the specific fee for each investment can vary and will be outlined in the project’s operating agreement after a project has been funded the money is pooled and moved into an individual llc which is the entity that will actually provide the loan or hold equity in the investment as such you will be a shareholder in this llc compared to many other real estate crowdfunding websites realtyshares accepts bitcoin for investments either through coinbase or your bitcoin address although distributions will be paid in us dollars in order to ask questions about fees payments or anything else you can contact realtyshares’ customer service department at  can realtyshares help you wisely diversify your investment portfolio chopping to the point considering the fact that realtyshares has received a fair amount of positive media attention that the real estate crowdfunding industry is in a growth phase and that there aren’t any negative online reviews for the company they appear to be a solid choice for purchasing shares in real estate projects have you invested in any projects through realtyshares if so what was your experience tell us about it by writing your review advertisement want to

in deep red triwest who sponsored  blairwood dr   chalon rd investment and paragon who sponsored  gilbert road have stopped making payments they have given lame excuses for delays they are running a ponzi scheme to dupe investors and realtyshares did not do any due diligence before offering this deal and luring investors dont get caught in this poor dealings bottom line no i would not recommend this to a friend help others find the most helpful reviews was this review helpful yes no comments  view all  commentshide comments may   ted triwest certainly has been a disaster fortunately they managed to sell the property i had investments in and made some money but nothing like their claimed return even though the property sold for more than the original financial estimate i agree that realtyshares does minimal due diligence what is shocking is you cant get access to the agreement with the sponsor only the realtyshares llc you are investing in so the real terms and conditions arent available they are also easy to dupe they did an investment that claimed it would put no debt on the property and the sponsor secretly went to another website and got another big loan on the property while claiming it was unencumbered realtyshares has been almost completely unresponsive to emails about issues but they certainly keep sending out emails about new opportunities a strong buyer beware not only does realityshares do little to no due diligence but they make it impossible for you to do so either go ahead and ask if the sponsor has other projects at realityshares and they wont answer i went back to making my own hard money loans so i have access to the property the borrower and can track things closely do you have an account log in before commenting if you don’t have an account –

seems natural to approach with caution since most people dont have much experience with this specific concept my experience has been very positive realtyshares has been very professional and responsible any real estate project has risks by default but i have had no issues after making more than  investments using the realtyshares platform realtyshares does a great job screening prospective deal sponsors because of that projects that might include underfunded developers crackpots slackers or sponsors who are challenged with planning and organization get screened out before any deal is offered on the platform the returnrisk equation has seemed promising to me on the vast majority of the deals offered i would  and have  recommended realtyshares to good friends bottom line

samuraislicing through moneys mysteriesrealtyshares review an easier way to invest in real estate posted by financial samurai  comments real estate is one of the best asset classes to build long term wealth as an owner of five properties i’ve seen my net worth soar over the past  years as my principal values and rents have increased far beyond inflation i came close to buying my th property but instead of taking down a hawaiian dream home for my parents i’ve decided to invest more surgically through realtyshares the leading real estate crowdsourcing platform in america here are three reasons why i didn’t want to own more physical property  property taxes i’m already paying over  a year in property taxes if i buy another property that costs let’s say m i’ll have to pay another  in taxes a year that’s just way too much  dealing with bad tenants if i were to buy this hawaiian home one of the plans was to rent out my parent’s old house for  –  a year after they moved tenants can be great or they can be a real pita the older you get the less you want to deal with tenants  too much financial risk to add millions of dollars in illiquid real estate exposure near the top of the honolulu market when  of my net worth is already exposed to real estate seems like a really bad move it’s much better to invest smaller sums in higher yielding markets instead real estate investment solution given i’m no longer parting with so much cash i’ve decided to invest some of the money in realtyshares a real estate crowdsourcing company based right here in san francisco they’ve raised over m in company funding from the likes of  startups top incubator general catalyst partners and union square ventures in order to open up investment opportunities for accredited investors in the subm real estate market as of may   they’re in the processing of closing their series c round realtyshares offers a mix of fixandflip loans preferred equity and mezzanine products joint venture equity and commercial loans those commercial buildings with higher returns that were once out of reach are now more readily available so far realtyshares has had over  million go through its platform from investors like myself investing in over  properties so why did i decide to invest in realtyshares rather than another real estate crowdsourcing company a relationship i had lunch with an old colleague who used to work at a fintech company i currently consult for he’s now a vp of finance at realtyshares we had gotten along well at his previous company and he and his colleague made me an offer i couldn’t refuse they are giving me  to invest in their platform in return i agreed to write about my experiences with their platform good and bad on financial samurai i love the synergies of blogging mobilizing capital the timing of this proposal was superb because not only am i passing on buying another physical property i also have a   yielding year cd expiring then i’ve got my final tranche of deferred compensation negotiated in  hitting my bank account in  as well my main goal is to find suitable income investment replacements for these funds assets that provide yield in this low interest rate environment are attractive just look at the year bond etf tlt up over  in the past  months the same goes for vnq the vanguard reit etf during this same period stocks have had a much more volatile ride and are only up about  past performance is not a predictor of future results but given i believe interest rates will stay low for a long time and given yield alternatives are so low i want to continue allocating my cash towards high yielding investments i’ve started with a  realtyshares commercial property investment and will work my way up to  –  investments in  and beyond it’s always good to start small only the best deals  make it through for investors to choose from realtyshares sign up process the sign up process is pretty straight forward and takes about three minutes step  input your first name last name telephone number step  self accredit by choosing how you are accredited income net worth joint income or business step  link a checking account or skip to first explore the various investments step  verify your email address step  reach the cooling off period this is a great step for all new investors the cooling off period is suggested by the sec for all investors to get comfortable with an investment before deploying capital it’s not mandatory just recommended after you fill out the questionnaire you’ll get a phone call from someone at realtyshares to talk about the product and answer all your questions examples of funded investments growth or income you’re either looking to invest in growth or income on the realtyshares platform my main focus is income given i’m satisfied with my current financial nut three main investment categories  single family residential property target  –  annual return you are the senior debt holder first position on lien the investment duration is usually  –  months and income usually paid out monthly this product is considered their least risky investment for investors and has been around since the beginning roughly  –  of total investments on the platform are in this category  preferred equitymezzanine debt target  –  annual return you provide bridge loan for sponsors and are a lower position in the capital stack the investment period is usually   years investments are mostly in commercial property roughly  –  of total investments on the platform are in this category this is where i will probably focus most of my investments since i already own single family residences  joint venture equity target  –  annual return you are an equity owner alongside the sponsor and take part in profits once preferred returns are hit typical duration is  years but can be as short as  years income is usually paid quarterly once the deal is closed this category accounts for roughly  –  of all investments other important information real estate crowdsourcing is considered an alternative asset class therefore it’s recommended you only allocate as much as you feel comfortable investing in alternatives although these investments are more liquid than a hawaiian dream property you still have to lock up your money for  months –  years further there may be additional capital calls if an investment turns out to require more capital than has been committed upfront many private wealth advisors recommend a  –  allocation meanwhile we know that some large university endowments invest  or greater in alternatives the whole idea of investing in alternatives is to capture outsized returns from inefficient markets the minimum investment is usually  but it can go as low as  for certain investment opportunities equity investment minimums are usually higher because there can only be a total of  investors per deal and the sponsor may require more capital depending on the deal to generate revenue realtyshares take a  to  origination fee on the debt it raises for projects on equity investments the company takes a cost reimbursement and makes a  to  percent management fee that’s better than me paying a property manager one month’s rent  finally there have been  investments successfully completed so far and there are currently  active investments on the platform i want to find cap rates in the midwest or south that are over  compared to just  –  in sf and honolulu for diversification purposes below is a map of realtyshares’ current investment offerings the arrows are where i’m focused on deploying capital texas alabama mississippi louisiana and georgia are my top picks if anybody is from one of these states please share how the real estate investment environment is focusing my money away from expensive coastal cities surgically deploying capital instead of overly concentrating new money into one very expensive property in hawaii i’m now going to surgically deploy capital into multiple types of investments with potentially greater returns less hassle and more liquidity as of h i’ve invested a total of  in their platform to gain more exposure to the heartland of america where real estate values are lower and yields are higher if you’re looking for yield in this low interest rate environment don’t want the hassle of managing rental properties don’t have the downpayment for a physical property want to more easily allocate real estate dollars around the country don’t like buying reits or real estate etfs that have already run and are looking to diversify your investment portfolio with real estate exposure take a look at the realtyshares platform i think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by their various investment opportunities this post contains sponsored links from realtyshares review summaryreviewed by financial samuraireview date reviewed realtysharesmy current rating  comments jon  be net worthy says july   at  am looks like a cool platform i’ll be interested to see how your investments do i’ve been intrigued by all of the real estate crowdsourcing platforms available that are making it so accessible getting a k bonus for trying it out is a nice boost will you include that in your next passive income report  reply financial samurai says july   at  am you remind me i have to publish my  annual passive income report yes i’m definitely happy to get the bonus and i will match it to put skin in the game i really need to find a comfortable way to deploy capital for income w my upcoming cd and final severance payment i’m only going to include the income from my realtyshares investments as part of my passive income report in the past i would just go all in too soon and just dump like  or  without being thoroughly thorough now i’m much more methodical as there’s no such thing as a riskfree investment except for cash cds and us treasuries reply bryan says july   at  am hey sam i have been evaluating the crowd funded real estate platforms as well my concern has been that many of these companies are self auditing their financials and don’t have outside accounting firms reviewing their financials do you know how realtyshare handles this my other big concern is more taxable income are you setting up this account in a taxable account or self directed ira i wouldn’t mind having a taxable account but wasn’t sure how the gains are taxed if you continually reinvest are you not taxed etc reply michael says july   at  am hello bryan we our a privately held company so we do self audit we are following gaap for our account practices and the sec requires a number of years of gaap accounting records if a company ever wants to go public so we are following those guidelines investors can invest in taxable accounts or a selfdirected ira reply david says august   at  pm even privately held businesses can get an independent audit of their financial statements a company planning to go public will need to have an audit at least a couple years before because ipos have a lot of legal liability for the cpa so they will not want to issue an opinion on ipo financial statements for a brand new client reply financial samurai says july   at  am good questions let me ask them to respond stay tuned i’m actually checking w my custodian of my rollover ira right now to see if i can invest my cash there into real estate crowdsourcing platforms if so i will be much more aggressive reply joe says july   at  pm minus of investing out of ira is that you can’t easily deduct losses i invest directly in similar properties through an investment group have to wait a long time between investments though commitments are larger but there is more visibility and control hard to judge performance of rs until we go through another financial crisis or lengthy recession reply nuclear real estate says july   at  am an important distinction between the cap rate in honolulu and the cap rates in the south and midwest is that you are not just comparing two different locations and price points but also completely different strategies renting your parent’s property in honolulu represents traditional buy and hold where your profit is driven by aquisition cost rental income and operational costs when investing in residential property through realtyshares you are not investing in buy and hold you are investing in either fix and flip or development the distinction here is important as you’d want to consider different factors depending on the approach with buy and hold you want to look at rentprice ratios property tax rates hoa fees etc these are largely predictable and easily researched if the borrower has history of profitability as a manager of their property this is a relatively predictable invesment with fix and flip or development you are much more interested in the appreciation in that market as well as the borrowers track record which could vary wildly from person to person and is where the realty shares vetting process is hugely important my  cents when analyzing the markets you mentioned is to look for areas with near term economic growth  strong appreciation to help hedge against the risk in trusting realty shares vetting process a “rising tides raise all boats” type of approach the type of thing i would be looking for is a big hiring event in smaller market a large manufacturing facility military base exapnsions etc a hiring event that is significant enough to create housing shortage pressure in that market and drive prices up all that said my buy and hold properties in augusta ga have done well the last  years with yield in excess of  i own and manage  of my own properties and am closing on  through a partnership on august th where my cash partner is providing  of the initial capital and we share the profits  his projected yield in year  is  reply financial samurai says july   at  am you are correct i’ve giving up buying a dream property for lifestyle bc my parents don’t want to move and am now going to invest my cash for income the next best thing imo related buy real estate for lifestyle first income second and capital appreciation third only  of the investments that first go through the vetting process end up available for investors picture in the post that gives me some confidence that i’m getting my money’s worth for the fees i will pay realtyshares need to offer good investments or long term they will not do well because investors will revolt and go somewhere else therefore the interest is aligned i don’t know anything about texas or georgia property just that the cap rates are so much better than in manhattan santa monica san francisco and honolulu given i don’t have to live in tx or ga not that they are bad places my investment dollars are location agnostic i just want to choose the best properties possible for the highest return i’m clearly heavily overweight the sf bay area along w my tahoe property if the tech market crashes thank goodness google fb and apple beat numbers then i will be hit harder than other re investors i need to diversify out i think everybody with coastal investment property should diversify inward and towards the south a  yield in augusta is amazing just give me a guaranteed  and i will invest all my money you would never get that here in sf but you may get a  capital appreciation in the past  years as a consolation any downsides to your physical properties in ga where are you based thanks for the feedback reply mitch says july   at  pm hi sam may i ask why you say inwards and towards the south i have a friend who lives in the bay area and he is currently looking at some commercial property his first such investment in the seattle area his realtor was showing him properties in texas but his reluctance with the south is the drought situation i’m just curious if you have a particular reason to not go north reply financial samurai says july   at  pm hola mitch i feel everything is relative to where one is north for me is seattle and portland two great booming cities could be good but since i’m already heavy in sf investing in seattle and portland is perhaps more of the same they are benefiting from bay area relocators and strength in amazon microsoft etc i shoulda invested there  years ago for better diversification i’m therefore looking inland and south where the dynamics price yield economies are very different from sf i’m too levered into this economy gotta find new opportunities reply mitch says july   at  pm that makes sense cheers reply nuclear real estate says july   at  am sam i am physically located in augusta having relocated from the bay area to the south twice now first after college at cal to wilmington nc then again from mountain view to augusta after working in san jose for  years two downsides to the physical properties  not the strongest appreciation my properties have appreciated about  in  years  scalability properties here are cheap with mine ranging from k in value that’s a good thing in that there is low barrier to entry and strong cash flow for example the last property i bought in may required k investment and cash flows month the downside is that scaling to something larger is more challenging cash flowing kyr here will require  properties which means managing  tenants when structuring the agreement with my partner on the two we’re buying now i presented the option of him putting up  of initial capital in exchange for a guaranteed  preferred return but he preferred me having skin in the game through a  capital contribution and was willing to waive the preferred return if a partner was willing to do  of initial capital i’d do guaranteed preferred returns all day with the rate being largely based on the volume that partner was willing to do higher volume of properties means greater dispersal of risk from any one property reply financial samurai says july   at  am do you like living there better than the bay area very curious as i’ve lived in virginia for  years before and have visited more southern states and not sure i’d be happy there after all i’m totally biased after writing west coast living – yes it really is that much better i have to say i would prefer owning one property that is generating kyr in rent versus  properties even though my capital outlay was bigger k down payment it just is too much of a pita to manage so many properties  properties means  to  bathrooms that could break  main electrical panels etc i couldn’t do it unless it is totally hands off like a reit or real estate crowdsourcing have you not gone through some tremendous tenant pain yet s reply nuclear real estate says july   at  am if i were in your financial situation i never would have left the bay area when i left i was making k  yr and very frustrated by my inability to meet my financial goals nor live in comfortable level of housing when i relocated i viewed it as a sacrifice i was willing to make to achieve my career and financial goals having now lived here  years i wouldn’t go back between my job and passive income i should surpass k yr within the next  months i’m able to live in a house nice enough to be a forever home with a month mortgage do things like surprise my dad with a mazda mita his dream car as a retirement gift etc life is also simpler not wrestling with traffic nor parking proximity to atlanta makes travel easy and both the beach and mountains are within a  hour drive i live a much much better lifestyle here i’ve had two major issues with k of damages which is significant given that’s  of property value most recently i evicted tenants earlier this year that were breeding and selling pit bulls out of the property i got them moved out repairs made and new tenants in within  days they were military so a quick call and text of pictures to their commanding officer and i was reimbursed within a week all told maybe  hours of work some might view all the issues as tremendous pain but i view  hours of work as a walk in the park for over k in annual yield the numbers will become a pain as we grow but given the low cost of living here hiring an assistant for hr would go a long way reply apathy ends says july   at  am thanks for the info sam i need to sit down and do a comparison of all the crowd sourced real estate platforms while we build up enough money to drop into one i was expecting you to be writing from hawaii a few months a year reply financial samurai says july   at  am i still will be just not in an fricking ridiculously awesome house  good thing the beaches are all free and close by mahalo reply bryan says august   at  pm i have done investments on realtyshares realtymogul alphaflow and realcrowd and have been pleased on all  sites although i will say my favorite is probably alphaflow and realtymogul reply  says april   at  am hi bryan i know this is old but i’ll try anyway it’s great that you’ve had positive experiences with re crowdfunding can you elaborate on why you prefer those two specifically for me it would be interesting to know whether it’s a matter of roi user interface transparency vetting diversity of investments etc or something else entirely reply bryan says april   at  pm mainly diversity of investments – i use alphaflow to invest in their funds so you get the diversification across  different residential loans versus focusing on the one offs for realtymogul i like their commercial and office offerings although not happy with their hotel deals that i am in what sites have you used reply vickimakesmarterdecisions says july   at  am thanks for the realtyshares information sam we have been thinking about purchasing another investment property we already have  units but are dealing with some pita issues right now too a third apartment going vacant next month… this seems like the perfect thing to consider rather than adding more properties – to diversify more and still stay in real estate one other really interesting point is  about your parents not wanting to move even to a “dream” home i can totally see that with my parents and it makes me think hard about finding the “right” house before we get to that age where moving becomes too much to think about reply financial samurai says july   at  am i’ve noticed that the older you get the more you are set in your ways i asked my dad if he wanted my  honda fit when i was considering lighting my money on fire by buying a porsche and he said “i don’t know how to use the start stop button” i told him you just have to press the brake and push the button to start he said “naaaaaaah” hard to change old habits we like what we know reply  says april   at  am c’mon sam if you’re talking about buying a nice car there’s a lot worse you could do than porsche am i biased sure just look at my handle here two years ago our suv was rearended i had already considered a used one but then the timing of the accident coincided with a nice owner excellent condition lowmiler smodel becoming available it’s the absolute cheapest porsche you can get marketwise i have a hard time believing that it will depreciate outside of sustaining physical damage especially with the recent change in engine  say what you will but the midengine is fun as hell to drive it’s a manual maintenance isn’t exactly cheap but they really are built to last i can enjoy it probably forever if i were into drag racing maybe i’d get a ‘vette but i much prefer the mountains and rivers carrying costs are pretty low i get about  mpg insurance is actually not very expensive nor is the annual registration i will always buy the best tires i can i’m just that kind of driver though i do park it down the street any time i have contractors coming to the house–people see that and just do not understand that it cost me less than a used honda i generally would not advocate for investing in cars but “lighting money on fire” is not your only option reply themoneymine says july   at  am all these options for realestate crowdfunding really make me looking forward to becoming an accredited investor i don’t know about texas in general but realestate in houston has many good opportunities for rental properties the market appreciates slowly year in my area but the rents are relatively high compared to the acquisition cost i actually bought a house because the monthly cost taxes mortgage hoa …all included is lower than my previous rent reply ctg says august   at  pm i disagree that houston real estate represents a good investment opportunity the housing market is still inflated from the oil boom of  prices have fallen somewhat from their peak but there are a few factors that suggest the bottom isn’t close first there is a lag with the oil company layoffs where people are still able to make ends meet for a while despite massive layoffs we haven’t seen a significant increase in foreclosures but its coming second people are still stuck on ideas of what their home is worth based on the  peak they are reluctant to sell for less so homes are sitting on the market and inventory is building lastly despite the common assertion that houston has diversified its economy oil and gas still drives roughly  of the houston economy most nonoil jobs just recirculate money brought in by oil and gas recently we’ve hit a tipping point where not only is the oil and gas sector losing jobs but nonoil and gas companies are shedding jobs because the oil money that sustains them is evaporating until the oil industry turns around the houston job market isn’t going to rebound and support for home prices isn’t going to pick up either and the picture for oil doesn’t look good demand for refined products continues to lag expectations of where it should be based on the low price environment the demand is looking a lot less elastic than most analysts assumed including those within my company and the competition between oil companies and oil states for market share is likely to hold prices down for quite a while i’m not saying there aren’t opportunities and it may still make sense to buy vs rent if you live in houston since rents are still also inflated but from a big picture perspective i would avoid investing in houston real estate at least for the next few years sam not sure if you can see access my email address but feel free to contact me to discuss reply the green swan says july   at  am this sounds similar to your post about eq vs iq again you probably like the idea of using a service that was not only formed right in your hometown but you also have a relationship with one of their executives thanks for providing an honest feedback on the service i also look forward to hearing more about what you invested in thanks reply financial samurai says july   at  am yes there are several real estate crowdsourcing platforms to choose from they all have some good things going for them i chose rs bc of their offer and my prior relationship with the vp of finance when i was in the office we’d joke around all the time he’s also a cal berkeley mba grad so that helps too sfbased cal grad priorrelationship able to sit down with them for two hours face to face able to continue meeting them in person and solid electronic communication outreach all played a big role reply zj thorne says july   at  am i am glad that even people who’ve achieved fi begin new investments in smaller increments to test them and see how they feel i’m not a qualified investor but i will be interested to see how this works for you over the next few years reply joe says july   at  am i’ve been thinking about real estate crowdfunding too i like it better than pp lending now pp lending isn’t bad but i’m sure the return will turn negative as soon as we get a recession i guess we’d see the same with real estate but at least you’d have some collateral i need to do more research too i think realty shares and realty mogul are two of the better ones reply smm says july   at  am hi sam this seems like a great opportunity for people who don’t want to deal with tenants maintenance put a whole lot of cash down on a property etc i have a medium to long term  year plan of acquiring a real estate investment property but now i’m wondering if i should earmark funds for something like this are there more reviewsindependent feedback on realtyshares  reply smm says july   at  am also how does realtyshares compare to fundrise which will accommodate to nonaccredited investors like myself  reply fiscally free says july   at  am looks like a pretty good opportunity i’ve been hearing a lot about these crowdfunded real estate companies it will be interesting to see if one becomes dominant i’m bummed you have to be an accredited investor to participate with minimum investments of  it’s easily within reach of nonaccredited investors it almost feels like a way for the rich to get richer while keeping “poor” people down reply financial samurai says july   at  am i hear you there are even investments below  as well check out these two posts on accredited investors fairness and policing httpwwwfinancialsamuraicomwhatisanaccreditedinvestorandisthedefinitionfair httpwwwfinancialsamuraicomcananyonebeanaccreditedinvestorthegovernmentcanttell reply fiscally free says august   at  pm cool posts i like your proposed definition for an accredited investor reply untemplater says july   at  am what a cool alternative no stress and you get to save a heck of a lot managing tenants and a mortgage can be super stressful so this is a convenient way to get exposure to real estate without all the hassles of real property can’t wait to hear about how your investment goes reply ton says july   at  am hi sam another amazing article and can’t wait for your results to come out i currently testing out with groundfloor about month into the process it looks pretty good so far i assume realtyshares probably only for accredited investors my questions will be how will your tax be taxed isn’t the tax so much better and lower when you directly own properties reply michael says july   at  am hello we have a great article on our blog about tax consequences in real estate please check out our post here httpthetaxconsequencesofrealestatecrowdfunding also you can find more information on our website under “learn” and “blog” michael reply financialibre says july   at  am thanks for the overview sam i’ve been watching this “real estate crowdfunding” movement for some time now and have wondered whether there’s anything more to this movement than a millennialstyled rebranding of reits plus a couple of troubling operational differences the lack of liquidity and higher leveraging of investments via crowdfunding platforms relative to reits makes them much riskier yet their incrementally higher promised returns and incrementally lower implied correlations with other asset classes don’t seem to compensate for the added downsides compared with traditional straightup physical real estate investment realtyshares et al are almost certainly better compared with reits or reit etfs hmmm… hard to see how they’re any better if not worse any thoughts on this front thanks again for the good post reply financial samurai says july   at  am i think one can and should consider both reit etfs have done great and will probably continue to outperform as investors search for yield for a real estate crowdsourcing investment it’s about finding the right property so you are making a more concentrated bet on specific regions and properties versus a reit which has a larger portfolio just more surgical everything is relative w liquidity i locked up  for years with this cd coming due for folks who have extra savings or aggressively spend less than they make they want to lock money up for as long as possible and just collect income it’s when the money comes due when there’s actually a reinvestment problem bc i don’t plan to spend any of the money going from a year cd to a m – y investment is more liquidity i’d prefer  – y lockups with a high irr actually any particular reits you are looking at reply financialibre says july   at  am thanks for the reply sam your thoughts make sense i agree with you entirely on the hunt for yield in this environment especially with a fed that seems stuck in limbo i think we have somewhat different views on the role and value of liquidity in the portfolio your older cds are very valuable because they locked in relatively high yields in an environment of declining interest rates and as you say for longterm investments with no plans to touch principal liquidity doesn’t seem to matter much on the other hand restricted vehicles like cds make rebalancing a bit tougher and foreclose or complicate opportunities to change strategy in the face of an altered investing environment betting on the directionduration of interest rate action is close to gambling and anything with a  year lockin at fixed rates could go either way for the investor relative to the rfr or inflation having said all that your view is sensible and the difference in our perspectives probably boils down to little more than delay discounting preferences particular reits i’m not one for making stock picks one reit i’ll mention though because it seems to satisfy two criteria important for reits appreciationincome and lowish correlation with the sp is rwr it’s performed well over the last several years though it’s hardly “particular” since it’s a broadbased etf “surgical” it isn’t but that’s kind of the point of these etfs by the way if you’re looking for a solid irr in an “alternative” investment with zero correlation with any other asset class i encourage you to look at the arbitrage opportunity surrounding dieselgate if you’re interested here’s an overview of how to turn a nice profit and get a free car in the process reply dustin says august   at  am what are your thoughts on realtymogul’s recently launched nontraded reit httpswwwrealtymogulcomresourcecenterarticlesrealtymogulcomlaunchesitsfirstcrowdfundedrealestateinvestmenttrust they’ve made it available to nonaccredited investors with a minimum investment of  they’ve acquired two properties so far and both seem reasonable might be another option for real estate diversification without the high commissionsfees of traditional nontraded reits or market correlation of publicly traded reits reply josh says july   at  am thanks sam this looks very interesting and will take a detailed look into it o the capabilities of the modern internet era reply reepekg says july   at  am ahem… self accredit does this mean realtyshares will not be inquiring whether i have m in investible assets or maybe just k and a larger than average risk appetite reply financial samurai says july   at  am i’m not sure but i’ve never been asked to verify my assets or income in the multiple private investments i’ve made since around age  the rule is to protect both the issuer and the investor the issuer doesn’t want to have backlash against the person who couldn’t afford to lose money in case of a bad investment the gov’t is also trying to protect the investor from not doing a proper investment allocation but now when investment limits are so low eg  versus  or  previously the rule makes less sense now see can anyone be an accredited investor reply hambone says july   at  pm hey sam what are you doing letting everyone in on the realtyshares secret you’re going to make all their good deals sell out in  minutes now  i’m an active investor in many deals on realtyshares and have been doing it for more than a year also active on peerstreet which is mostly firstposition notes everything has been great on realtyshares so far and i’m now in process of setting up a sd ira to do even more i’ve researched just about all the crowdsourced real estate and other alternative investment platforms more time than i care to admit and i highly recommend realtyshares i’m primarily doing preferred equity deals as the time horizon  years fits with what i want returns are in the  range for crowdfunding deals like this i personally think preferred equity or hard money loans make more sense than jv equity — the due diligence i’d have to do to feel comfortable with the downside risk of returns on jv deals goes beyond the scope of information shared on crowdfunding sites preferred equity investor gets x principal takes the rest seems to fit the crowdfunding model better where there is less connection and therefore less trust and less info sharing between the lps and the gps i do jv equity deals but with investors i know not on crowdfunding sites setting up an sd ira and putting a heavy allocation into realtyshares deals seems to be the winning ticket for retirement savings even if there happen to be some busted deals along the way that’s what i’ll be doing and i’ll end up with about x the money vs the crappy traditional mutual fund route when i start withdrawing in  years while sitting on a beach reply financial samurai says july   at  am hah at first i wrote your comment off because i thought there would be more than enough investment choices to choose from but as i do more research on the investment opportunities many are unavailable or i’ve got to get on the waitlist since i’m focused on the midwest and south perhaps only about  of the listings are available to me hence i’m learning i need to be patient i definitely want to do a selfdirected ira for these types of investments hopefully the tax docs will be much simpler as a result if not i can just file the ks i need to double check w rs and my custodian bank on sd iras i’m waiting on them to get back to me i’m also going to focus on pref equity no jv deals for me as an experienced realtyshares investors i’d love for your to share in a guest post how you go about picking your investments your process your reasons and your returns one day thx reply hambone says august   at  am indeed you’ll need to be patient if you very intelligently have specific criteria you’re looking for realtyshares seems to have one of the highest  of active deals of any of the crowdfunding sites and at least for me i still only see a deal i want to invest in once every few weeks or so and often time those deals will “sell out” within a day or two so you have to stay on top of it if you’re serious about it i expect that will change as they continue to build up their deal flow there seems to be a lot of good things happening to make it easier to invest sd ira funds in crowdfunding sites within the last month or so realtyshares has made it easier to invest from a sd ira or at least they have advertised so on the sd ira custodian side i’ve noticed a couple of them have setup specific “plans” for people investing in crowdfunding sites — these “plans” have significantly lower fees for crowdfunding deals compared to other sd ira investments so you end up paying significantly less to put k in a crowdfunding platform vs k in a direct real estate deal or k in gold for example still not as easy as just opening up a vanguard account for a rollover ira but i expect this sd ira  crowdfunding real estate strategy to pick up a lot of steam soon guest post about my realtyshares experience sure i’d be honored my first deal on the platform finishes its term in  months… personally at least that is an interesting date as i’ll have had experienced how the platform works throughout the entire deal cycle at the very least i’ll update you with the status here in the comments thanks reply sdnerd says july   at  pm looks interesting – will have to look into the details closer what i’m most curious about is what happens when things start to unravel we’re at record price levels again and most of these investments are several years out while i tend to agree low rates are going to be here for a while – imho there’s going to be a pop at some point and it could be a really nasty one again same concern with the lendingclubs of the world – everything looks good in hockey stick chart periods but what happens when the party stops there’s simply no data points to go by simply too new short term investments in re over the next few years at least initially feels like musical chairs – hope you get your money before the music stops whereas a traditional rental property the music stops and you can just hold and ride it out realtyshare website has  options for their drop down “how would your k have faired” – and  of the  show you were better off investing in the sp  i get the diversification approach here just thought it was interesting to see that unprecedented times with massive amounts of money chasing yield reply financial samurai says july   at  am true i wonder when a nationwide re slowdown will occur i know it is occurring in nyc sf and honolulu bc i follow the markets closely i do not plan to reinvest in these markets for at minimum  years from now but most likely  years if ever instead of throwing m into honolulu w leverage where i think i can get a deal i’d rather invest  –  cash in higher cap rate areas and projects i’m chasing yield for sure just trying to be more disciplined about it what are your investments and what are you doing w your money reply sdnerd says july   at  am i’m heavy in the market  vanguard usinternational  ca real estate then like you k in cash and ca mostly tax free muni that i’m debating what to do w wish i had a great answer there  i’m further south in ca housing down here has gotten crazy again imho a couple of my friends are actually looking to sell now to lock in a couple hundred grand in profits then rent and ride it out expecting a downswing in the next few years the number of  tesla’s i see on the road seems to be increasing at a dramatic pace market at records highs rates at unprecedented lows having been through the last two big bubbles there’s a lot of similarities lendingclub stock is now at  and another report just came out showing investments into online lending platforms is down  first half of this year vs back half of last over concerns of fraudrisksetc if companies like this are already getting thrown back against the ropes in the second largest bull market in us history… what happens when the music changes tunes or stops that’s my biggest concern on these new social lending sites of all varieties seems like exponentially more risk for about the same return as a wildly diversified vanguard fund reply john says july   at  pm what is the advantage over directly buying notes and if the developer has overpaid does realty shares have any servicers reply joe says july   at  pm k in property taxes dang that’s alot homes seem to have a greater sentimental or emotional value for you it seems you are very reluctant to sell and take the gains maybe the market is different in sf here in vancouver it feels like an impending bubble if i were in your shoes i’d sell all the properties put your portfolio or “nut” in bondsdividend stocks and live off the yield with your net worth you probably would get over k cash annually and factor in low dividend taxes no property taxes or maintenance you could rent your own dream place in hi forget about buying reply financial samurai says july   at  am joe i’m impressed with the  foreigners tax implemented in vancouver surely that must pop the bubble as everything pauses and causes sellers to get desperate no maybe the foreign money actually makes its way to places like sf as a result i’ve wondered for a long time what type of industries and jobs make vancouver re so expensive could it really just be money from china accounting for  of volume i wanted to sell my  condo when my tenants vacated but didn’t go allout in marketing it didn’t put on mls or do any light remodeling so maybe i didn’t really want to sell but i did find tenants who are paying more a month  who seem ideal so we shall see yes kyear in property taxes is a crap load of money so it’s vexing when someone who pays  property taxes a year votes to raise property taxes further to fund our community we really should institute a residence tax where everybody pitches in and therefore thinks twice about voting for ever more spending reply joe says july   at  pm hey sam the tax was just implemented so we’ll see what kind of effect it will have prices have risen drastically in the last  years i could have bought a brand new condo in downtown then for k now prices start at k and salaries obviously haven’t increased at the same ratio there really is no industry or jobs that justify prices it makes absolutely no sense except that it’s a bubble mentality reply adam says july   at  pm sam thanks for the article you mentioned that you opted not to buy in hawaii in part because you didn’t want to pay very much more in property taxes or deal with tenancy issues but aren’t the returns on your real estate investments on realtyshares going to be affected by property taxes in one way or another and potentially subject to tenancy issues reply financial samurai says july   at  am hi adam yes the returns should be reflected in a rs investment the fees taxes maintenance etc should all be baked into the returns if i can get  –  net after everything without doing anything that’s really all i care about in and out over max  years not perpetual taxes and maintenance s reply elizabeth says july   at  pm this is the way i understood it i registered for an account and reading more about it but also trying to figure out the tax consequences if i remember correctly i read that investing in different states may require filing a tax return in that state i was getting tired then there is the choice between debt and equity considerations it says there is a  day cooling down period which i think is a good thing but after registering there was a message that said that i would get a call that may allow them to reduce the  day cooling down period i wonder how that works reply firecracker says july   at  pm “real estate makes people think irrationally and i was probably delirious after visiting so many beautiful places it’s much better to invest smaller sums in higher yielding markets” i wish my friends had this mentality most of them jump into bidding wars without thinking most of them have never even heard of pricetorent ratio or cap rate shakes head this is why the toronto and vancouver housing markets are doomed realestate crowd sourcing sounds interesting we have reits in our portfolio that’s the extent of our exposure to realestate so far it’s gone up  in the past year–higher than the  rise in toronto housing what are your thoughts on reits reply financial samurai says august   at  pm i like all income producing assets including reits this low interest rate environment necessitates them reply flyersrule says august   at  am do you know if there are state rules about being able to invest in real estate crowdfunding i know that being from pennsylvania i couldnt do proper or lendingtree reply flyersrule says august   at  am my thought process is should i just keep putting money into index funds fstvx taxable account that have been getting  yr and not throwing off much taxable events until i sell or do i do a crowdfund for lets say  but need to pay taxes at end of year  tax bracket with my tax bracket my  return on this would be closer to  right reply arb says august   at  pm cool it looks like you can invest directly in equity and just be a small part owner of a property right putting aside your personal connection to realtyshares sam which platform would you recommend realtyshares or fundrise or would you recommend both like in pp lending they say to invest in both prosper and lending club quick question you don’t have to be an accredited investor to invest right sincerely arb–angry retail banker reply md says august   at  am sam i have used fundrise since  and have been very happy they now seemed to be solely focused on ereits which doesn’t allow for the time diversification i am looking for thanks for the info on realty shares reply howard says august   at  am sam do you have a recommendation for a custodial service to set up a self directed ira account to purchase real estate investments from realty shares reply srini reddy says august   at  am hey sam as always this is very good post with right timing on investing in realty shares i registered few days back and just made my first investment for k in debt i am curious on what kind of strategy you are going to apply here as you just have k to invest i am still deciding on how much should i put in here next market crash is really scaring me but i think we still have yrs  reply robert says august   at  pm howard rs has a partnership with entrust group and currently charge a flat fee for the rs portion of your sdira i am currently using equity trust and will be moving my k rs investments over at the end of the year when my annual fee is up reply annemarie wood says august   at  pm i’d be curious to read a post about how realtyshares compares to fundrise since you have dabbled in both reply guslevy says august   at  pm  parents really don’t want to move i havehad dreams like you of buying a place in hawaii with a nice ohana quarters the vision is to live that dream life of waking to the smell of plumerias coffee in hand as i stare into the vast pacific ocean while figuring out which brunch spot to hit before hitting the beach part of this vision is that the parents would stay in the quaint ohana quarters so that we have our perfect family compound in paradise the kid would be going to punahou of course the wife would be working the necessary social network to ensure some position within the community i would be a index at the golf club and thus feared and admired for my grace talent and impeccable flop shot with the  degree wedge it’s funny though that the parents who have lived for decades in a seemingly dreary existence in a middling house in a middling neighborhood with middling friends are apprised of this paradise vision of life that can be had…and yet the parents refuse the offer before the pitch is even midway the reality is that your parents my parents other parents…they are all human beings who have built a life that literally has immovable roots connected to that middling house in the middling neighborhood surrounded by middling friends…and that’s their own version of paradise move them to that high falootin house in kahala and they will lose a comfortable house a neighborhood they are familiar with and knucklehead friends who have grown old together with them the ocean view wouldn’t be the same for them reply financial samurai says august   at  am you’re pretty spot on we get set in our ways the older we get i don’t mind saving my money and just do some remodeling instead if necessary but that also looks unnecessary simple is nice reply ap says september   at  pm i’ve been using realtyshares for about  years now been in about  offerings my self  of the debt deals have already paid back interest and capital since they were the shortest ranging about  to  months the other three are are preferred equity deals which are still in progress overall i am happy with the service and platform they are very responsive over email and will gladly answer any questions that pertain to any deal on the platform it started off as an experiment but i am now getting more comfortable with crowdfunding and will slowly allocate more of my asset allocation to this asset class i have also allocated  to the fundrise growth ereit i have allocated pretty much the minimums to all these deals i’d advise start off slow and stick to the minimums do research and over time one should get comfortable with how to compare deals reply hawaiianfichaser says december   at  am i’m not sure if anyone has addressed this but does the company have a contingency plan in place should they burn through all their cash and close their doors is there a plan in place to wind down the investments should that happen i couldn’t find anything on their website or in the comments addressing this there are a lot of companies entering as well as burning out of the pp space right now reply financial samurai says december   at  am excellent question and something i asked one of their capital markets people “if realtyshares goes out of business your rights will not change and a third party – a backup servicer called first associates – would take this management of the llc and handle payments” the capital you deploy will continue to be invested in your particular investments and first associates main roll is to handle the distribution and collection of payments reply hawaiianfichaser says december   at  am good to see they have a plan in place additionally i’d imagine a reduced risk of fraud in real estate pp versus lending clubprosper aloha reply derek says march   at  pm do you have any updates on your realtyshares experience online reviews seem to be all over the place and i’m interested to hear your more trusted experience thanks reply financial samurai says march   at  pm so far so good i invested in one project in pa for  and i decided to invest  in the realtyshares dme fund in feb  that chooses the best from its platform they have a pref return of  and a target irr of  i figure might as well have the gatekeepers of the deals choose what they think are the best deals right the only problem is that the minimum is  so i haven’t talked about it sam reply chris bang says may   at  pm sam regarding realtyshares and investing via simple ira do you have any recommendations on custodians that can hold the ira without gouging high fees etc i have a realtyshares account but want to invest via one of my ira’s but the ira must be transferred to a custodian like entrust or millenium that will allow for those types of investments i too am in northern ca and want to diverse holdings to other areas of the country as well realtyshares seems like a great investment vehicle to serve that purpose reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email  website dont subscribe all

realtysharessign up for realtysharesback to platformssimilar real estate crowdfunding platforms crowdfundingfundrisepatch of landrealtyshares reviewaverage rating  reviewssummaryrealtyshares has some strong points including adequate capital support from savvy backers a userfriendly website and some good press investors also like its low minimums  for your first deal generally  thereafter and hold periods as short as six months it is also trying some innovative things such as accepting bitcoin and providing marketspecific products aimed at its core investor base among it professionals in five cities but the platform’s investments are weighted toward single family home flips a riskier niche in which projects tend to be put together by individuals and smaller operators the site does have some funds and multifamilycommercial projects but on the whole its deal flow is lower quality than some of the top names in the re crowdfunding universe investors who like the deals it offers will find realtyshares a likeable and easy to navigate platform but it is only accessible to accredited investors and it’s imperative that you fully grasp the risks involved background founded in q  by ceo nav athwal realtyshares has received  million in three rounds of fundraising from five investors including  million in a series a funding in april  its backers include well known venture capitalists menlo ventures general catalyst partners and  startups menlo ventures’ managing director john jarve who sits on the board of hot automated investing service betterment is on the realtyshares board realtyshares has been compared to a lending club for real estate offering a new way for investors to put small amounts into real estate projects it funds about  to  projects a month the inspiration for athwal was to disrupt the slow and inefficient process by which developers borrowed money from banks to fund property development those loans usually take weeks or months to close – compared to as little as four days for crowdfunded deals on realtyshares after the financial crisis of  traditional loans were difficult to impossible for many project sponsors to access open a realtyshares accountquick factsminimum investment assets under management unknownyear founded number of users realtyshares fees management fees for investorsexpert walkthrough pros low minimum of  for first investment otherwise usually  focus on deals with short lifecycles cons deal quality is not high weighted to single family home flip market only for accredited investors high fees bottom line realtyshares is a smaller player in the realestate crowdfunding arena it has some differentiators that may help it make the cut including deals with short lifecycles and low minimum investments but its deal flow includes many single family home flips which are considered riskier and lower quality than typical projects on other platforms its fees are considered higher than average too philosophy realtyshares’ founder athwal says that realtyshares is intended to fill a niche that banks have not adequately served especially small real estate developers and house flippers the process of borrowing money from banks is fraught for these operators as banks reined in their lending after the  economic crisis they often will not lend to individuals without w income crowdfunding via an online platform is more streamlined and offers investors a chance to earn better returns in one case covered by cnbc chicago house flipper ben walhood said he can get full funding from realtyshares in as little as an hour investors in his deals would earn around  vs loans around  if backed by fannie mae and freddie mac in traditional financing realtyshares is “able to provide quicker more efficient capital that helps meet the needs of these investors who are looking for speed of execution and the ability to be flexible with their terms as well as with the underwriting standards banks just aren’t meeting that need” athwal said typical projects and geography at the time of our test there were five live deals on the site including a fund two single family flips and two apartment buildings three were in california and the others in new york and florida realtyshares has done transactions in  states and seems to have a strong representation in past deals from florida california illinois and texas the deals we saw ranged in size from  to  million for the realtyshares portion and were a mix of debt and equity transactions minimum investment ranged from  to  and hold terms from eight months to five years realtyshares says it welcomes cashflowingvalue add equity investments in commercial and residential properties such as apartments retail office and pools of single family homes equity investment in fix and flips in high demandlow supply markets and loans secured by residential and commercial real estate target demographic realtyshares is only open to accredited investors meaning those with net worth of  million or income of  a year the platform says it is aimed at investors interested in sub institutional projects in the  million to  million range and all types of cashflowing residential and commercial projects realtyshares says that its investors prefer hold periods ranging from six months to two years many of its users are technology professionals who are natural early adopters of the online crowdfunding model realtyshares said in  that  to  of its investors are abroad but its website currently states that foreign investors cannot participate interest in innovation athwal says most investors who have joined the platform so far have been technology professionals looking for new investment opportunities unique among real estate crowdfunding platforms the company has identified five markets with rising tech and real estate sectors where it sees attractive opportunities it is creating marketspecific products to enable developers in seattle dallas austin miami and chicago to raise funding from local investors realtyshares’ interest in innovation led it in  to become the first crowdfunding platform to accept the digital currency bitcoin as a form of payment the platform says this is a more costeffective and streamlined way for investors to send money especially if they are abroad because it involves lower transaction fees and faster transfers website popularity as of june  realtyshares has an estimated  monthly unique visitors via desktop who spend an average of about  minute on the site with  page views about  of the traffic is from the united states as of midmay  realtyshares ranked sixth among real estate crowdfunding sites in the united states leadership team realtyshares’ founder athwal trained as an electrical engineer and lawyer he worked as a developer and broker for his own real estate company and then as a real estate and land use attorney representing california and national developers and reits in the san francisco bay area he doesn’t have the star power of some other crowdfunding entrepreneurs but his credentials are solid the management team is rounded out by eight specialists with handson experience in operations transactions engineering and other disciplines again they have strong resumes but not high name recognition realtyshares’ leadership earned a b grade in one review what do the experts think realtyshares has received funding from some investors with track records for betting on successful ventures such as  startups so that represents a vote of confidence in the platform but it has gotten fewer accolades than some other sites and media coverage has tended to focus on its potential for financing single family home flip projects or more novel features such as acceptance of bitcoin blogger mark robertson wrote about his experience with five investments on realtyshares while he describes several of the projects as having some unanticipated occurrences such as higher than budgeted taxes or permitting delays he said they have met or beat expectations summary realtyshares looks like a solid platform with longterm potential while its low minimum investments are attractive it loses points for its lower quality deal flow and higher than average fees it is open exclusively to accredited investors and focuses on shorter hold deals especially fix and flip single family home projects it’s not a good starting point for novices and may not even be a good first choice for more seasoned investors deal structure investors can access both debt investments in the form of first or secondposition loans usually yielding a fixed interest rate of  annually as well as equity investments in residential and commercial properties offering cash flows during the hold period andor a portion of the profits upon a sale of the property how does realtyshares screen investments realtyshares reviews the sponsors first looking for companies with experience it says it runs background and credit checks then it reviews proposed transactions including financials geography property type and quality and investment structure “while each investment includes risk and realtyshares cannot guarantee results our vetting process seeks to ensure that only quality investment properties are listed on the platform” it says “once an investment opportunity is listed on the platform investors have full discretion as to whether to personally invest in the opportunity and if so how much” so like other crowdfunded real estate sites it’s up to you to do your due diligence underwritingdeal flow ceo athwal said that as of spring  realtyshares had no defaults or major issues with any of its projects and only lists about  in  properties that are offered to it “i think that really goes to our underwriting criteria and the strictness with which we adhere to when we are looking at a property” he said however the site more than other real estate crowdfunding platforms focuses on single family home flips these are often sponsored by solo or smaller operators and experts consider them generally to be riskier and lowerquality deals than bigger budget projects fees realtyshares says it charges a fee when you invest in a specific offering to cover investor reporting and communications but the site is quite opaque on the details and directs you to the deal operating agreement the ones we viewed were plus page legal agreements similar to a prospectus that are not for the novice to decipher as best we could tell the ongoing fees to realtyshares as manager of the transaction llc amounted to  a year realtyshares could do a whole lot better explaining the costs and ongoing fees in its deals this article says realtyshares takes an administrative fee on funds raised through the website of  percent to  percent it also takes the annual fee in order to service the investment including providing investors with tax documents and distributions through the platform a realtyshares presentation for a funding round in february  showed it earning fees of  that is comparatively high among re crowdfunding platforms and reduces the earning potential of your investment ease of use realtyshares has a more involved signup process than other platforms we have test driven while some sites initially ask only for an email address and password realtyshares seeks your phone number address employer amount you want to invest and type of deal that interests you if you are just wanting to explore the site without making a commitment that might make you leery but it also suggests realtyshares wants to offer an experience tailored to your interests so it could be a plus for some it offers a chance to check boxes signaling interest in such things as residential flips with  return  month hold unsecured to cash flow retail and long hold apartment deals after signing up you see a countdown clock on the day cooling off period you are also directed to a helpful eightminute webinar introducing the site and how to navigate it we liked this feature a lot listings the page for individual offerings is nicely laid out and easy to follow there’s a deal dashboard and tabs allow you to view an overview financials documents photos background on management and faqs one closed deal we looked at had an audio recording of a webinar the sponsor gave discussing the project which provided a wealth of information what am i buying on realtyshares realtyshares explains what you are actually buying this way realtyshares sets up a separate limited liability company llc for each investment opportunity that is listed on the platform that llc in turn will make a loan on a real estate property in the case of a debt investment or hold equity in an llc or lp that in turn owns real estate property in the case of an equity investment when you invest through realtyshares you own shares in that llc using this structure you will have the benefit of limited financial exposure while also avoiding taxes at the entity level if you invest in a debt deal the fund you invest in will be secured by a residential or commercial property and will receive monthly interest payments a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account if you invest in an equity investment opportunity usually in a residential or commercial property or group of properties the fund you invest in will receive periodic payments of cash flow from rents andor a share of the proceeds when the property is eventually sold as with debt investments a share of those payments will be deposited directly into your bank account how safe is my money as we’ve said before real estate crowdfunding is not for investing novices and that holds even truer for realtyshares experts point out the niche is in its infancy and there has not yet been a chance to watch a complete life cycle of many deals real estate by its nature can be a risky investment and realtyshares is weighted toward single family home flips which have more inherent risks than other types of deals while offering documents list risk factors ad nauseum realtyshares could do a much better job of making its site transparent it says it is currently affiliated with wealthforge a registered brokerdealer with finra and member of sipc both of which are securities industry bodies aimed at protecting investors and that wealthforge provides compliance and regulatory oversight to realtyshares but it’s unclear if sipc protections apply to realtyshares investments even if they do they do not protect against loss in value liquidity issues or financial problems with sponsors they would only protect the custody function of the broker dealer in truth it is up to you to research carefully and understand fully the risks of any deal you enter and that is a big reason why only accredited investors are allowed to participate open a realtyshares accountrealtyshares reviews investorjunkie  there are various pluses and minuses with the service but realtyshares would work better if it didn’t have the requirement for accredited investors crowdfunding generally democratizes investing making it available to even the smallest investors the accredited investor requirement limits the platform to use by high income and high net worth individuals we’ll give realtyshares a rating of  out of  stars with the accredited investor requirement being the biggest negative crowdfunding website reviews we have singled out realtyshares for the purpose of our first real estate crowdfunding site review due to a few recent stories that caught our eye not the least of which is their forwardthinking leadership giving potential investors the ability to invest using bitcoin we love the idea of taking a “virtual currency” and turning it in to the most tangible of investments this move has the potential of bringing a new crowd to real estate investing the tech crowd open a realtyshares account greenland to diversify into brokerage
