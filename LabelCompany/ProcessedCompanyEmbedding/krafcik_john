industrial leannews product reviews lean guides skip to content industrial leannews product reviews lean guides a subsidiary of creative safety supply – providing lean and s products menu tag john krafcik “lean”  years later  was an interesting year to say the least the beginning of the bush era in washington was about to begin prozac was set free and quickly becomes the leading remedy for all depression needs parents still felt good about buying their children peewee herman dolls chavez ravine still echoes screams of regret as cars lined up to exit game one of the world series early and raymond babbitt definitely stole the hearts of millions on the big screen  years ago we were also introduced to a term known as “lean” that would begin a revolution in the manufacturing industry a new lean the concept of lean practices and ways of thinking were nothing new to the folks at toyota but their was no term it was just the way things were done around there the term “lean” was simply defined as a “deficient in flesh or “containing little or no fat” merriamwebster but that would soon change about the same time kirk gibson was pumping his fists in the air as he limped around the bases breaking the hearts of oakland fans everywhere john krafcik would forever set his name in the manufacturing history books it was in his  sloan management review article “triumph of lean production systems” where he officially coined the term “lean” although the concepts and processes had been around for years before krafcik introduced the term it was not until this article that they really started to take off in the us krafcik had been a quality engineer in the toyotagm nummi joint venture in california before heading to mit for his mba studies his research would be continued by the international motor vehicle program at mit which would soon produce the international bestselling book the machine that changed the world by james womack daniel jones and daniel roos  years later at the time lean philosophies had been used solely in the auto industry  years later we see lean concepts implemented in just about every industry around for most lean is a set of “tools” that assist in the identification and continuous elimination of waste muda the elimination of waste is a slow continuous process that improves quality while production times and costs are reduced some of the more common tools are s kaizen kanban pokayoke and value stream mapping lean has come a long way from it’s early days and still has a long ways to go in a recent interview published on youtube womack was asked “what comes after lean” “nothing because all this is about is how people work together collaboratively to try to create more value and correct perfect value with less and less and so this is a long long human story that we’re involved in that goes back  years of people thinking about that…it doesn’t end because the fundamental problem doesn’t go away and the problem is that the world always needs more value and the waste is getting in the way of value we happen to give it a label for this time– which is lean” womack’s response is one that is widely agreed upon in the lean culture even though the language has stayed the same over the years how we talk about lean has changed what we have today is more of a drive to understand lean as a process of improvement instead of a box of tools but like womack states “it doesn’t end”  the current struggle up until recently the biggest struggle with lean was understanding the concepts however as the popularity spreads and industries across the globe enjoy the results of their lean implementation today’s biggest struggle has become sustainability the ideas and concepts behind the lean movement are all still valid and make perfect sense when designing a business plan for success but the human element is always a factor more and more we hear the term “lean culture” without it the ability to sustain your progress becomes merely a headnod at the beginning of a company meeting the ability to sustain and build a lean culture has become the next big challenge among lean experts everywhere while there’s no definitive answer many believe it is in the hands of leaders to build and sustain their culture the behaviors that shape and build your organization’s culture will always play a factor in your success whether it’s lean or some other form of improvement process without a belief in the system there is no system how the leaders shape the next  years is anybody’s guess but if it’s anything like the previous  we should be in for a good ride towards improvement     search for search archives archives select month december  november  october  september  august  july  may  march  february  january  december  november

john krafcik — first car despite the influence of his brothers corvettes krafcik opted for a  ford capri coupe he bought it used with  miles on it and drove it from his hometown of southington conn to stanford university while in school he piled on another  miles before selling it for more than he paid for it krafcik saidbook learning krafcik studied mechanical engineering at stanford where he says he took every autorelated class the school offered i desperately wanted to go to work in the car industry to design cars krafcik said thats what i felt i was put on the earth to do he graduated in  and despite a job offer from general motors in michigan krafcik was still smitten with californias weathera lucky turn with incredible serendipity he worked for a year at a xerox dot matrix plant in fremont calif then gm and toyota announced they were opening the new united motor manufacturing plant in the same town and krafcik was hired as the plants first engineer he worked under yoshimitsu ogihara a mysterious yodalike mentor who krafcik says was absolutely foundational in his career and approach to manufacturing the venture sought to bring toyotas innovative lean manufacturing process to the often wasteful and redundant gm process it was awesome that i was there at the start of this awakening of western industry to how to build great things in massive quantities krafcik said keep on truckin krafciks next stop was mits sloan school of management for an mba where he studied under james womack coauthor of the machine that changed the world a seminal book on toyota after graduation krafcik landed a job at ford where he remained for  years he started at an rd team tasked with countering gms saturn brand before moving to fords truck suv and van team he was on this team in the heyday of ford and lincolns profitability based on suvs and he loved the work eventually landing as chief engineerlane change by  he was looking for a brand for which he could work on the entire lineup and saw potential in what hyundai was making it just felt like a magical moment where i thought i can really help these guys take it to the next level krafcik said he started as vice president for product development and five years later he was running the companys north american operations as ceo a seat he held until the end of  in his decade with hyundai the company transformed from the butt of jokes to a serious contender in every segment it targeted spurred by industryleading moves such as a mile warranty electronic stability control as a standard feature and eyecatching designs but his time with the korean automaker was tainted by hyundai and corporate cousin kias admission in  that they had inflated fuel economy ratings on about  vehicles krafcik wouldnt comment on the issue or on his contract not being renewed but he remains on excellent terms with hyundai he saidnew roads krafcik said that throughout his career hes been a data geek data will set you free he quipped this was one of the main draws to truecarcom for krafcik which he joined as president on april  the site which sold stock to the public for the first time may  lets shoppers choose the exact model and trim level of vehicle they want and then see what other customers in their region have paid for the vehicle they can search by closest dealer or lowest guaranteed sticker price about  dealers subscribe to truecar out of about  nationally and each one within truecars network guarantees that the price they show on truecars site is what theyll sell that exact vehicle for only when the customer buys the car does the dealer pay truecar a flat fee for the referral not only does it give consumers a datadriven look at what they could and should pay for a car but it gives dealers an inexpensive focused way to reach customers krafcik said cutting down on the huge expense of advertising and incentivespersonal though he now works in santa monica krafcik makes the commute from costa mesa where he lived during his hyundai days but he has some enviable machines to ease the driving woes in the garage is a  porsche  carrera s and a righthanddrive caterham super  a lightweight opentop

automotive ambitions we look at the man tasked with bringing the google driverlesscar project to life andrew tonner tmfthedude sep   at pm source google auto industry meet tech tech industry meet autos such is the collision course between the global technology and automotive industries that many myself included eagerly hope will lead to meaningful improvements to the way we travel and commute in the decades to come along with hybrids and electric vehicles such as tesla motors a number of technologys most powerful incumbents  specifically google nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl and apple  are both well under way in developing their respective automotive products and although apple recently turned heads when word of the accelerated production schedule for its project titan made the news google also generated plenty of buzz when it hired longtime auto executive john krafcik as the first ceo of its selfdriving car project earlier this month so as he tries to take on apple tesla and detroit what should google investors know about its new automotive chief here are four important points on the man currently at the helm of googles driverlesscars project  he has an autoindustry resume to die for krafcik earned his undergraduate degree in engineering with distinction from stanford and his masters in management a precursor to its mba program from mit after completing his graduate research more on that in a moment krafcik took his talents to ford where he worked in product management for  years after that he worked at hyundai north america for a decade the latter half of which he served as the ceo of hyundai north america  hes a budding entrepreneurkrafcik then opted to transition into a different area of the automotive industry  the startup space from april of last year through his departure to head googles driverless car initiatives this month krafcik held the position of president at carpricing service truecar where he helped lead the companys successful ipo last may in discussing this time as a member of truecars executive team he still holds a board seat krafcik said i was attracted to truecar because i love the auto industry i love the retail side and the dealer network  but i also love tech and this is one of those rare companies that operates at the intersection of auto retail and technology   that quote paints krafcik as the perfect person to help bring googles automotive efforts to market and google investors should take comfort in the fact that such a wellregarded leader chose to shepherd this high profile project  hes a visionary researcher while completing his studies at mits sloan school of management krafcik pioneered research that would forever change the manufacturing process and production world if youve ever heard the popular term lean manufacturing or any of its numerous derivations  lean management lean startup and so on  krafcik wrote the paper that introduced the topic his paper triumph of the lean production system led to this concepts place as a pillar of operations thinking nearly  years since krafcik first published his research this feat alone would be enough to have provided an illustrious career which makes his numerous other accomplishments all the more impressive  hes a true executive on googles driverlesscar team lastly a bit of perspective on krafcik and his place within googles overall selfdriving car efforts krafcik should be thought of as an executive in its most literal sense although hes a brilliant engineer and production veteran google has gone to great lengths to hire some of the brightest minds in driverlesscar technology among them project directors sebastian thrun and chris urmson these pure technologists are more likely to create the actual product while krakciks role will more likely involve helping with the production side and leveraging his deep pool of contacts within the automotive industry for advice and talent that the project requires this approach seems very much in line with the typical ceo and vplevel manager relationship however for those new to this storyline it deserves mentioning foolish bottom line since the start of the month a number of marquee storylines have brought increased attention to this budding intersection of two formerly distant industries krafciks hiring as the first ever ceo of a google x subsidiary fits this bill however the increased competition were likely to see as competition heats up between these two powerhouse industries will require far more than the kind of pedigree krafcik brings to the table now its up to

this template message model of the lean production systemcitation needed lean manufacturing or lean production often simply lean is a systematic method for waste minimization muda within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity lean also takes into account waste created through overburden muri and waste created through unevenness in work loads mura working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service value is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for lean manufacturing makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which is not adding value this management philosophy is derived mostly from the toyota production system tps and identified as lean only in the s tps is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved the steady growth of toyota from a small company to the worlds largest automaker has focused attention on how it has achieved this success contents  overview  history  preth century  th century  henry ford  toyota develops tps  types of waste  lean implementation develops from tps  lean leadership  differences from tps  lean services  goals and strategy  examples lean strategy in the global supply chain and its crisis  strategy  crisis  steps to achieve lean systems  design a simple manufacturing system  continuous improvement  measure  implementation dilemma  see also  references  further reading  external links overviewedit lean principles are derived from the japanese manufacturing industry the term was first coined by john krafcik in his  article triumph of the lean production system based on his masters thesis at the mit sloan school of management krafcik had been a quality engineer in the toyotagm nummi joint venture in california before joining mit for mba studies krafciks research was continued by the international motor vehicle program imvp at mit which produced the international bestselling book coauthored by jim womack daniel jones and daniel roos called the machine that changed the world a complete historical account of the imvp and how the term lean was coined is given by holweg  for many lean is the set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced a non exhaustive list of such tools would include smed value stream mapping five s kanban pull systems pokayoke errorproofing total productive maintenance elimination of time batching mixed model processing rank order clustering single point scheduling redesigning working cells multiprocess handling and control charts for checking mura there is a second approach to lean manufacturing which is promoted by toyota called the toyota way in which the focus is upon improving the flow or smoothness of work thereby steadily eliminating mura unevenness through the system and not upon waste reduction per se techniques to improve flow include production leveling pull production by means of kanban and the heijunka box this is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools which may partially account for its lack of popularity the difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself but rather the prime approach to achieving it the implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence the advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a systemwide perspective whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective both lean and tps can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste these principles include pull processing perfect firsttime quality waste minimization continuous improvement flexibility building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers autonomation load leveling and production flow and visual control the disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the tps has grown pragmatically since  as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities thus what one sees today is the result of a need driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework toyotas view is that the main method of lean is not the tools but the reduction of three types of waste muda nonvalueadding work muri overburden and mura unevenness to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved from this perspective the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles abovecitation needed also known as the flexible mass production the tps has two pillar concepts justintime jit or flow and autonomation smart automationfull citation needed adherents of the toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as sideeffects if production flows perfectly meaning it is both pull and with no interruptions then there is no inventory if customer valued features are the only ones produced then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values the other of the two tps pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation whereby automation is achieved with a human touchfull citation needed in this instance the human touch means to automate so that the machinessystems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable flexibility is required to allow production leveling heijunka using tools such as smed but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development rd however adaptability is often constrained and therefore may not require significant investment more importantly all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value the cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself there are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand perform and manage the work environment to achieve these three goals simultaneously one of toyotas mentoring methodologies loosely called senpai and kohai which is japanese for senior and junior can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up the closest equivalent to toyotas mentoring process is the concept of lean sensei which encourages companies organizations and teams to seek thirdparty experts that can provide advice and coaching in  spear and bowen identified four rules which characterizes the toyota dna all work shall be highly specified as to content sequence timing and outcome every customersupplier connection must be direct and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses the pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method under the guidance of a teacher at the

lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from benjamin franklin through documented examples poor richards almanack says of wasted time he that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently throw s into the river he added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales a penny saved is two pence clear a pin aday is a groat ayear save and have again franklins the way to wealth says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths henry ford cited franklin as a major influence on his own business practices which included justintime manufacturing the accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert frank gilbreth who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground the introduction of a nonstooping scaffold which delivered the bricks at waist level allowed masons to work about three times as quickly and with the least amount of effort th centuryedit frederick winslow taylor frederick winslow taylor the father of scientific management introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment in principles of scientific management  taylor said and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates or by implication cutting wages or discharging workers when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it shigeo shingo the bestknown exponent of single minute exchange of die and errorproofing or pokayoke cites principles of scientific management as his inspirationneed quotation to verify american industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to american workers during the s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure henry towne past president of the american society of mechanical engineers wrote in the foreword to frederick winslow taylors shop management  we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processescitation needed henry fordedit henry ford henry ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system charles buxton going wrote in  fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer ford in my life and work  provided a singleparagraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about  of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste a former employee harry bennett wrote one day when mr ford and i were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the d t  i railroad this slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces you know mr ford said to me theres iron in that slag you make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over and take it back to the plant in other words ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron fords early success however was not sustainable as james p womack and daniel jones pointed out in lean thinking what ford accomplished represented the special case rather than a robust lean solutionpage needed the major challenge that ford faced was that his methods were built for a steadystate environment rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today although his rigid topdown controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels his approach did not respond well to uncertain dynamic business conditions they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation this was made clear by fords precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a followon to the model t design for manufacture dfm is a concept derived from ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in my life and workcitation needed this standardization was central to fords concept of mass production and the manufacturing tolerances or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing decades later the renowned japanese quality guru genichi taguchi demonstrated that this goal post method of measuring was inadequate he showed that loss in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances but increased as described by the taguchi loss function at any condition exceeding the nominal condition this became an important part of w edwards demings quality movement of the s later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as cycle time variation in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries while ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters work to make the production line possible until ford a cars components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use so that they would connect properly by enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture he eliminated this work almost entirely reducing manufacturing effort by between  however fords mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of pull production and thus often suffered from overproduction toyota develops tpsedit sakichi toyoda toyotas development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the th century with sakichi toyoda in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke this became the seed of autonomation and jidoka toyotas journey with justintime jit may have started back in  when it moved from textiles to produce its first car kiichiro toyoda founder of toyota motor corporation directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing he decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process in  when toyota won its first truck contract with the japanese government his processes hit new problems and he developed the kaizen improvement teams levels of demand in the post war economy of japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application having visited and seen supermarkets in the usa taiichi ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales given the financial situation during this period overproduction had to be avoided and thus the notion of pull build to order rather than target driven push came to underpin production scheduling it was with taiichi ohno at toyota that these themes came together he built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the toyota production system tps it is principally from the tps which was widely referred to in the s as justintime manufacturing but now including many other sources that lean production is developing norman bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of fords today and tomorrowcitation needed i was first introduced to the concepts of justintime jit and the toyota production system in  subsequently i had the opportunity to witness its actual application at toyota on one of our numerous japanese study missions there i met mr taiichi ohno the systems creator when bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking he just laughed and said he learned it all from henry fords book the scale rigor and continuous learning aspects of tps have made it a core concept of lean types of wasteedit although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified this then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim the elimination of waste is the goal of lean and toyota defined three broad types of waste muda muri and mura it should be noted that for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits to illustrate the state of this thinking shigeo shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement this ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between valueadding activity waste and nonvalueadding workneed quotation to verify nonvalue adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions one key is to measure or estimate the size of these wastes to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal the flow or smoothness based approach aims to achieve jit by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver rationale or target and priorities for implementation using a variety of techniques the effort to achieve jit exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks by forcing smooth flow of only valueadding steps these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization such as carrying heavy weights moving things around dangerous tasks even working significantly faster than usual it is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits this may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations to link these three concepts is simple in tps and thus lean firstly muri focuses on the preparation and planning of the process or what work can be avoided proactively by design next mura then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level such as quality and volume muda is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively it is seen through variation in output it is the role of management to examine the muda in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the muri and mura of the system the muda and mura inconsistencies must be fed back to the muri or planning stage for the next project a typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of making the numbers as the end of a reporting period approaches demand is raised to make plan increasing mura when the numbers are low which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched this stretch and improvisation leads to muristyle waste which leads to downtime mistakes and back flows and waiting thus the muda of waiting correction and movement the original seven mudas tim wood are transport moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing inventory all components work in process and finished product not being processed motion people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing waiting waiting for the next production step interruptions of production during shift change overproduction production ahead of demand over processing resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity defects the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects eventually an eighth muda was defined by womack et al  it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications many others have added the waste of unused human talent to the original seven wastes for example six sigma includes the waste of skills referred to as underutilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training other additional wastes added were for example space these wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by taiichi ohno in tps but were found to be useful additions in practice in  geoffrey mika in his book kaizen event implementation manual added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted the waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of participative management and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers not having the proper software training on use and time spent surfing playing games or just wasting time for a complete listing of the old and new wastes see bicheno and holweg  the identification of nonvalueadding work as distinct from wasted work is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course breakthroughs in smed and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challengedcitation needed lean implementation develops from tpsedit lean leadershipedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking experienced kaizen members at toyota for example often bring up the concepts of senpai kohai and sensei because they strongly feel that transferring of toyota culture down and across toyota can only happen when more experienced toyota sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions one of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators kpi the kpis by which a plantfacility are judged will often be driving behaviour because the kpis themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done this can be an issue where for example a truly lean fixed repeating schedule frs and jit approach is adopted because these kpis will no longer reflect performance as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid it is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this kpi chaos within the organization similarly commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean lean accounting provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting after formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the toyota production system tps toyota formalized in  the basis of its lean management the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run these core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of continuous improvement relentless elimination of waste and respect for people engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust this formalization stems from problem solving as toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past  years it hit the same problems in getting tps properly applied that other western companies have had in copying tps like any other problem it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern these countermeasures have focused on culture how people behave which is the most difficult challenge of all without the proper behavioral principles and values tps can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results as with tps the values had originally been passed down in a masterdisciple manner from boss to subordinate without any written statement on the way just as with tps it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding however as toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of tps toyota set to put the toyota way into writing to educate new joiners continuous improvement breaks down into three basic principles challenge having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize ones ambition what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge to do so we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals kaizen good enough never is no process can ever be thought perfect so operations must be improved continuously striving for innovation and evolution genchi genbutsu going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions create consensus and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed respect for people is less known outside of toyota and essentially involves two defining principles respect taking every stakeholders problems seriously and making every effort to build mutual trust taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives teamwork this is about developing individuals through team problemsolving the idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance shop floor teams the whole site as team and team toyota at the outset differences from tpsedit while lean is seen by many as a generalization of the toyota production system into other industries and contexts there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementationcitation needed seeking profit is a relentless focus for toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle price – cost  profit and the need therefore to practice systematic cost reduction through tps or otherwise to realize benefit lean implementations can tend to deemphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of flow or pull however the emergence of the value curve analysis promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottomline performance measurements tool orientation is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools standardized work value stream mapping visual control etc to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent the tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems the tools employed at toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with as each tools limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood so for example value stream mapping focuses upon material and information flow problems a title built into the toyota title for this activity but is not strong on metrics man or method internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality downtime personnel development cross training related issues capacity bottlenecks or anything to do with profits safety metrics or morale etc no one tool can do all of that for surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used management technique rather than change agents has been a principle in toyota from the early s when they started emphasizing the development of the production managers and supervisors skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon stafflevel change agents to drive improvements this can manifest itself as a push implementation of lean rather than pull by the team itself this area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist but that of the natural operations work team leader although less prestigious than the tps specialists development of work team supervisors in toyota is considered an equally if not more important topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals specifically it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in toyota since they lead the daily work areas and they directly and dramatically affect quality cost productivity safety and morale of the team environment in many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true emphasis is put on developing the specialist while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own lack of understanding is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the west fail to bring any benefit in factory physics hopp and spearman describe this as romantic jit where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results in this aspect lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science others have compared it to cargo cult science lean servicesedit main article lean services lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services for example call center services use these principles to improve live agent call handling by combining agentassisted automation and leans waste reduction practices a company reduced handle time reduced between agent variability reduced accent barriers and attained near perfect process adherence lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology it more generally the use of lean in information technology has become known as lean itcitation needed lean methods are also applicable to the public sector but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean providespage needed the challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have this makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation however some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean despite this it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of techniques or tools need to be better translated into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors the upshot of this is that each implementation often feels its way along as must the early industrial engineering practices of toyota this places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developmentscitation needed lean management is nowadays implemented also in nonmanufacturing processes and administrative processes in nonmanufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase goals and strategyedit the espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors while some maintain an internal focus eg to increase profit for the organization others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer some commonly mentioned goals arecitation needed improve quality to stay competitive in todays marketplace a company must understand its customers wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements eliminate waste waste is any activity that consumes time resources or space but does not add any value to the product or service reduce time reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs reduce total costs to minimize cost a company must produce only to customer demand overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs the strategic elements of lean can be quite complex and comprise multiple elements four different notions of lean have been identified lean as a fixed state or goal being lean lean as a continuous change process becoming lean

template message lean production has been adopted into other industries to promote productivity and efficiency in an ever changing market in global supply chain and outsource scale information technology is necessary and can deal with most of hard lean practices to synchronise pull system in supply chains and value system the manufacturing industry can renew and change strategy of production just in time the supply chains take changes in deploying second factory or warehouse near their major markets in order to react consumers’ need promptly instead of investing manufacturing factories on the lostcost countries for instance dell sells computers directly from their website cutting franchised dealers out of their supply chains then the firm use outsourced partners to produce its components deliver components to their assembly plants on these main markets around the world like america and china zara made decision of speeding their fashion to the consumers market by fastproducing cloths within five weeks with their local partners in spain and never involved in mass production to pursue new styles and keep products fresh the other way to avoid market risk and

companiesneed quotation to verify with the improvement of global scale supply chains firms apply lean practices jit supplier partnership and customer involvement built between global firms and suppliers intensively to connect with consumers markets efficiently crisisedit after years of success of toyota’s lean production the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought toyota to the position of being the worlds biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion in  the crisis of safetyrelated problems in toyota made other carmakers that duplicated toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them james womack had warned toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems indeed the crisis cost a great fortune and left toyota thinking whether the jit practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of japan that is proven as the economy of scale becomes global the softlearn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers if they could keep good sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection otherwise toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component it might bring more safety on riskcontrol and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future the appliance of jit in supply chain system is the key issue of lean implementation in global scale how do the supply partners avoid causing production flow global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of production flow at the same timecitation needed steps to achieve lean systemsedit the following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system design a simple manufacturing system recognize that there is always room for improvement continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design design a simple manufacturing systemedit a fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demandbased flow manufacturing in this type of production setting inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customers order the benefits of this goal include decreased cycle time less inventory increased productivity increased capital equipment utilization continuous improvementedit a continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the companys goals the term continuous improvement means incremental improvement of products processes or services over time with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality customer service or product performance lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities the value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for everything else is waste and should be eliminated simplified reduced or integrated rizzardo full citation needed improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts

well in a lean environment also pmts methodstime measurement cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and it effectiveness in the operational processes for example juning ker and yichuan wang analyze two prescribing technologies namely no carbon required ncr and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering transcribing and dispensing process in a multihospital health system with comparison between these two technologiesthe statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology the results indicated a reduction of  in queue time  in order entry time  in outgoing delay time and  in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology implementation dilemmaedit one criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean consequently adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel as a result lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation in addition many of the popular lean initiatives coming from the tps are solutions to specific problems that toyota was facing toyota having an undesired current condition determined what the end state would look like through much study the gap was closed which resulted in many of the tools in place today often when a tool is implemented outside of tps a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives the tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed thus the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs the actual root cause the lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance value stream mapping vsm and s are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes or cover the entire supply chain for example you might start from analysis of skus using several days to identify and draw each skus path evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer conducting a gap analysis determines the companys must take steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective based on that evaluation the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis fmea in order to identify and prevent risk factors it is crucial for frontline workers to be involved in vsm activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity after adopting the lean approach both managers and employees experience change therefore decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey there are several requirements to control the lean journey first and most importantly experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan developed by the lean leadership in other words the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement second coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey they will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient third the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important it will enable collection of the data required for informed decisionmaking by a leader one cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs to control and improve results going forward one must see and measure ie map what is happening now lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises one distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting for standard cost accounting skus are difficult to grasp skus include too much hypothesis and variance ie skus hold too much indeterminacy manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting in using lean accounting one expected gain is activitybased cost visibility ie measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and suppliescitation needed see alsoedit a problem solving cellular manufacturing efficiency movement s methodology

systematic method for waste minimization muda within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity lean also takes into account waste created through overburden muri and waste created

manufacturing makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which is not adding value this management philosophy is derived mostly from the toyota production system tps and identified as

the machine that changed the world a complete historical account of the imvp and how the term lean was coined is given by holweg  for many lean is the set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced a non exhaustive list of such tools would include smed value stream mapping five s kanban pull systems pokayoke errorproofing total productive maintenance elimination of time batching mixed model processing rank order clustering single point scheduling redesigning working cells multiprocess handling and control charts for checking mura there is a second approach to lean manufacturing which is promoted by toyota called the toyota way in which the focus is upon improving the flow or smoothness of work thereby steadily eliminating mura unevenness through the system and not upon waste reduction per se techniques to improve flow include production leveling pull production by means of kanban and the heijunka box this is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools which may partially account for its lack of popularity the difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself but rather the prime approach to achieving it the implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence the advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a systemwide perspective whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective both lean and tps can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste these principles include pull processing perfect firsttime quality waste minimization continuous improvement flexibility building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers autonomation load leveling and production flow and visual control the disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the tps has grown pragmatically since  as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities thus what one sees today is the result of a need driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework toyotas view is that the main method of lean is not the tools but the reduction of three types of waste muda nonvalueadding work muri overburden and mura unevenness to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved from this perspective the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles abovecitation needed also known as the flexible mass production the tps has two pillar concepts justintime jit or flow and autonomation smart automationfull citation needed adherents of the toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as sideeffects if production flows perfectly meaning it is both pull and with no interruptions then there is no inventory if customer valued features are the only ones produced then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values the other of the two tps pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation whereby automation is achieved with a human touchfull citation needed in this instance the human touch means to automate so that the machinessystems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable flexibility is required to allow production leveling heijunka using tools such as smed but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development rd however adaptability is often constrained and therefore may not require significant investment more importantly all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value the cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself there are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand perform and manage the work environment to achieve these three goals simultaneously one of toyotas mentoring methodologies loosely called senpai and kohai which is japanese for senior and junior can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up the closest equivalent to toyotas mentoring process is the concept of lean sensei which encourages companies organizations and teams to seek thirdparty experts that can provide advice and coaching in  spear and bowen identified four rules which characterizes the toyota dna all work shall be highly specified as to content sequence timing and outcome every customersupplier connection must be direct and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses the pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct any improvement must be made in accordance with the

waste reduction thinking most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from benjamin franklin through documented examples poor richards almanack says of wasted time he that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently throw s into the river he added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales a penny saved is two pence clear a pin aday is a groat ayear save and have again franklins the way to wealth says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths henry ford cited franklin as a major influence on his own business practices which included justintime manufacturing the accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert frank gilbreth who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground the introduction of a nonstooping scaffold which delivered the bricks at waist level allowed masons to work about three times as quickly and with the least amount of effort th centuryedit frederick winslow taylor frederick winslow taylor the father of scientific management introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment in principles of scientific management  taylor said and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates or by implication cutting wages or discharging workers when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it shigeo shingo the bestknown exponent of single minute exchange of die and errorproofing or pokayoke cites principles of scientific management as his inspirationneed quotation to verify american industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to american workers during the s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure henry towne past president of the american society of mechanical engineers wrote in the foreword to frederick winslow taylors shop management  we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processescitation needed henry fordedit henry ford henry ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system charles buxton going wrote in  fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer ford in my life and work  provided a singleparagraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about  of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste a former employee harry bennett wrote one day when mr ford and i were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the d t  i railroad this slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces you know mr ford said to me theres iron in that slag you make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over and take it back to the plant in other words ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron fords early success however was not sustainable as james p womack and daniel jones pointed out in lean thinking what ford accomplished represented the special case rather than a robust lean solutionpage needed the major challenge that ford faced was that his methods were built for a steadystate environment rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today although his rigid topdown controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels his approach did not respond well to uncertain dynamic business conditions they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation this was made clear by fords precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a followon to the model t design for manufacture dfm is a concept derived from ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in my life and workcitation needed this standardization was central to fords concept of mass production and the manufacturing tolerances or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing decades later the renowned japanese quality guru genichi taguchi demonstrated that this goal post method of measuring was inadequate he showed that loss in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances but increased as described by the taguchi loss function at any condition exceeding the nominal condition this became an important part of w edwards demings quality movement of the s later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as cycle time variation in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries while ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters work to make the production line possible until ford a cars components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use so that they would connect properly by enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture he eliminated this work almost entirely reducing manufacturing effort by between  however fords mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of pull production and thus often suffered from overproduction toyota develops tpsedit sakichi toyoda toyotas development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the th century with sakichi toyoda in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke this became the seed of autonomation and jidoka toyotas journey with justintime jit may have started back in  when it moved from textiles to produce its first car kiichiro toyoda founder of toyota motor corporation directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing he decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process in  when toyota won its first truck contract with the japanese government his processes hit new problems and he developed the kaizen improvement teams levels of demand in the post war economy of japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application having visited and seen supermarkets in the usa taiichi ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales given the financial situation during this period overproduction had to be avoided and thus the notion of pull build to order rather than target driven push came to underpin production scheduling it was with taiichi ohno at toyota that these themes came together he built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the toyota production system tps it is principally from the tps which was widely referred to in the s as justintime manufacturing but now including many other sources that lean production is developing norman bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of fords today and tomorrowcitation needed i was first introduced to the concepts of justintime jit and the toyota production system in  subsequently i had the opportunity to witness its actual application at toyota on one of our numerous japanese study missions there i met mr taiichi ohno the systems creator when bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking he just laughed and said he learned it all from henry fords book the scale rigor and continuous learning aspects of tps have made it a core concept of lean types of wasteedit although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified this then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim the elimination of waste is the goal of lean and toyota defined three broad types of waste muda muri and mura it should be noted that for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits to illustrate the state of this thinking shigeo shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement this ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between valueadding activity waste and nonvalueadding workneed quotation to verify nonvalue adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions one key is to measure or estimate the size of these wastes to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal the flow or smoothness based approach aims to achieve jit by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver rationale or target and priorities for implementation using a variety of techniques the effort to achieve jit exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks by forcing smooth flow of only valueadding steps these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization such as carrying heavy weights moving things around dangerous tasks even working significantly faster than usual it is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits this may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations to link these three concepts is simple in tps and thus lean firstly muri focuses on the preparation and planning of the process or what work can be avoided proactively by design next mura then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level such as quality and volume muda is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively it is seen through variation in output it is the role of management to examine the muda in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the muri and mura of the system the muda and mura inconsistencies must be fed back to the muri or planning stage for the next project a typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of making the numbers as the end of a reporting period approaches demand is raised to make plan increasing mura when the numbers are low which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched this stretch and improvisation leads to muristyle waste which leads to downtime mistakes and back flows and waiting thus the muda of waiting correction and movement the original seven mudas tim wood are transport moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing inventory all components work in process and finished product not being processed motion people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing waiting waiting for the next production step interruptions of production during shift change overproduction production ahead of demand over processing resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity defects the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects eventually an eighth muda was defined by womack et al  it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications many others have added the waste of unused human talent to the original seven wastes for example six sigma includes the waste of skills referred to as underutilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training other additional wastes added were for example space these wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by taiichi ohno in tps but were found to be useful additions in practice in  geoffrey mika in his book kaizen event implementation manual added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted the waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of participative management and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers not having the proper software training on use and time spent surfing playing games or just wasting time for a complete listing of the old and new wastes see bicheno and holweg  the identification of nonvalueadding work as distinct from wasted work is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course breakthroughs in smed and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challengedcitation needed lean implementation develops from tpsedit lean leadershipedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking experienced kaizen members at toyota for example often bring up the concepts of senpai kohai and sensei because they strongly feel that transferring of toyota culture down and across toyota can only happen when more experienced toyota sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions one of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators kpi the kpis by which a plantfacility are judged will often be driving behaviour because the kpis themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done this can be an issue where for example a truly lean fixed repeating schedule frs and jit approach is adopted because these kpis will no longer reflect performance as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid it is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this kpi chaos within the organization similarly commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean lean accounting provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting after formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the toyota production system tps toyota formalized in  the basis of its lean management the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run these core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of continuous improvement relentless elimination of waste and respect for people engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust this formalization stems from problem solving as toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past  years it hit the same problems in getting tps properly applied that other western companies have had in copying tps like any other problem it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern these countermeasures have focused on culture how people behave which is the most difficult challenge of all without the proper behavioral principles and values tps can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results as with tps the values had originally been passed down in a masterdisciple manner from boss to subordinate without any written statement on the way just as with tps it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding however as toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of tps toyota set to put the toyota way into writing to educate new joiners continuous improvement breaks down into three basic principles challenge having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize ones ambition what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge to do so we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals kaizen good enough never is no process can ever be thought perfect so operations must be improved continuously striving for innovation and evolution genchi genbutsu going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions create consensus and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed respect for people is less known outside of toyota and essentially involves two defining principles respect taking every stakeholders problems seriously and making every effort to build mutual trust taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives teamwork this is about developing individuals through team problemsolving the idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance shop floor teams the whole site as team and team toyota at the outset differences from tpsedit while lean is seen by many as a generalization of the toyota production system into other industries and contexts there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementationcitation needed seeking profit is a relentless focus for toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle price – cost  profit and the need therefore to practice systematic cost reduction through tps or otherwise to realize benefit lean implementations can tend to deemphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of flow or pull however the emergence of the value curve analysis promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottomline performance measurements tool orientation is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools standardized work value stream mapping visual control etc to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent the tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems the tools employed at toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with as each tools limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood so for example value stream mapping focuses upon material and information flow problems a title built into the toyota title for this activity but is not strong on metrics man or method internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality downtime personnel development cross training related issues capacity bottlenecks or anything to do with profits safety metrics or morale etc no one tool can do all of that for surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used management technique rather than change agents has been a principle in toyota from the early s when they started emphasizing the development of the production managers and supervisors skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon stafflevel change agents to drive improvements this can manifest itself as a push implementation of lean rather than pull by the team itself this area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist but that of the natural operations work team leader although less prestigious than the tps specialists development of work team supervisors in toyota is considered an equally if not more important topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals specifically it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in toyota since they lead the daily work areas and they directly and dramatically affect quality cost productivity safety and morale of the team environment in many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true emphasis is put on developing the specialist while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own lack of understanding is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the west fail to bring any benefit in factory physics hopp and spearman describe this as romantic jit where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results in this aspect lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science others have compared it to cargo cult science lean servicesedit main article lean services lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services for example call center services use these principles to improve live agent call handling by combining agentassisted automation and leans waste reduction practices a company reduced handle time reduced between agent variability reduced accent barriers and attained near perfect process adherence lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology it more generally the use of lean in information technology has become known as lean itcitation needed lean methods are also applicable to the public sector but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean providespage needed the challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have this makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation however some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean despite this it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of techniques or tools need to be better translated into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors the upshot of this is that each implementation often feels its way along as must the early industrial engineering practices of toyota this places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developmentscitation needed lean management is nowadays implemented also in nonmanufacturing processes and administrative processes in nonmanufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase goals and strategyedit the espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors while some maintain an internal focus eg to increase profit for the organization others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer some commonly mentioned goals arecitation needed

is any activity that consumes time resources or space but does not add any value to the product or service reduce time reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs reduce total costs to minimize cost a company must produce only to customer demand overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs

chain networks has brought toyota to the position of being the worlds biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion in  the crisis of safetyrelated problems in toyota made other carmakers that duplicated toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them james womack had warned toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems indeed the crisis cost a great fortune and left toyota thinking whether the jit practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of japan that is proven as the economy of scale becomes global the softlearn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers if they could keep good sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection otherwise toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component it might bring more safety on riskcontrol and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future the appliance of jit in supply chain system is the key issue of lean implementation in global scale how do the supply partners avoid causing production flow global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of

is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment also pmts methodstime measurement cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and it effectiveness in the operational processes for example juning ker and yichuan wang analyze two prescribing technologies namely no carbon required ncr and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering transcribing and dispensing process in a multihospital health system with comparison between these two technologiesthe statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology the results indicated a reduction of  in queue time  in order entry time  in outgoing delay time and  in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology implementation dilemmaedit one criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean consequently adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel as a result lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation in addition many of the popular lean initiatives coming from the tps are solutions to specific problems that toyota was facing toyota having an undesired current condition determined what the end state would look like through much study the gap was closed which resulted in many of the tools in place today often when a tool is implemented outside of tps a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives the tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed thus the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs the actual root cause the lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance value stream mapping vsm and s are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes or cover the entire supply chain for example you might start from analysis of skus using several days to identify and draw each skus path evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer conducting a gap analysis determines the companys must take steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective based on that evaluation the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis fmea in order to identify and prevent risk factors it is crucial for frontline workers to be involved in vsm activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity after adopting the lean approach both managers and employees experience change therefore decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey there are several requirements to control the lean journey first and most importantly experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan developed by the lean leadership in other words the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement second coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey they will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient third the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important it will enable collection of the data required for informed decisionmaking by a leader one cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs to control and improve results going forward one must see and measure ie map what is happening now lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises one distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting for standard cost accounting skus are difficult to grasp skus include too much hypothesis and variance ie skus hold too much indeterminacy manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting in using lean accounting one expected gain is activitybased cost visibility ie measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and suppliescitation needed see alsoedit a problem solving

systematic method for waste minimization muda within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity lean also takes into account waste created through overburden muri and waste created through unevenness in work loads mura working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service value is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for lean manufacturing makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which is not adding value this management philosophy is derived mostly from the toyota production system tps and identified as lean only in the s tps is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved the steady growth of toyota from a small company to the worlds largest automaker has focused attention on how it has achieved this success contents  overview  history  preth century  th century  henry

chain and its crisis  strategy  crisis  steps to achieve lean systems  design a simple manufacturing system  continuous improvement  measure  implementation dilemma  see also  references  further reading  external links overviewedit lean principles are derived from the japanese manufacturing industry the term was first coined by john krafcik in his  article triumph of the lean production system based on his masters thesis at the mit sloan school of management krafcik had been a quality engineer in the toyotagm nummi joint venture in california before joining mit for mba studies krafciks research was continued by the international motor vehicle program imvp at mit which produced the international bestselling book coauthored by jim womack daniel jones and daniel roos called the machine that changed the world a complete historical account of the imvp and how the term lean was coined is given by holweg  for many lean is the set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced a non exhaustive list of such tools would include smed value stream mapping five s kanban pull systems pokayoke errorproofing total productive maintenance elimination of time batching mixed model processing rank order clustering single point scheduling redesigning working cells multiprocess handling and control charts for checking mura there is a second approach to lean manufacturing which is promoted by toyota called the toyota way in which the focus is upon improving the flow or smoothness of work thereby steadily eliminating mura unevenness through the system and not upon waste reduction per se techniques to improve flow include production leveling pull production by means of kanban and the heijunka box this is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools which may partially account for its lack of popularity the difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself but rather the prime approach to achieving it the implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence the advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a systemwide perspective whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective both lean and tps can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste these principles include pull processing perfect firsttime quality waste minimization continuous improvement flexibility building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers autonomation load leveling and production flow and visual control the disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the tps has grown pragmatically since  as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities thus what one sees today is the result of a need driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework toyotas view is that the main method of lean is not the tools but the reduction of three types of waste muda nonvalueadding work muri overburden and mura unevenness to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved from this perspective the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles abovecitation needed also known as the flexible mass production the tps has two pillar concepts justintime jit or flow and autonomation smart automationfull citation needed adherents of the toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as sideeffects if production flows perfectly meaning it is both pull and with no interruptions then there is no inventory if customer valued features are the only ones produced then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values the other of the two tps pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation whereby automation is achieved with a human touchfull citation needed in this instance the human touch means to automate so that the machinessystems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable flexibility is required to allow production leveling heijunka using tools such as smed but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development rd however adaptability is often constrained and therefore may not require significant investment more importantly all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value the cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself there are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand perform and manage the work environment to achieve these three goals simultaneously one of toyotas mentoring methodologies loosely called senpai and kohai which is japanese for senior and junior can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up the closest equivalent to toyotas mentoring process is the concept of lean sensei which encourages companies organizations and teams to seek thirdparty experts that can provide advice and coaching in  spear and bowen identified four rules which characterizes the toyota dna all work shall be highly specified as to content sequence timing and outcome every customersupplier connection must be direct and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses the pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method under the guidance of a teacher at the lowest possible level in the organization historyedit preth centuryedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the printer benjamin franklin contributed greatly to waste reduction thinking most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from benjamin franklin through documented examples poor richards almanack says of wasted time he that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently throw s into the river he added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales a penny saved is two pence clear a pin aday is a groat ayear save and have again franklins the way to wealth says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths henry ford cited franklin as a major influence on his own business practices which included justintime manufacturing the accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert frank gilbreth who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground the introduction of a nonstooping scaffold which delivered the bricks at waist level allowed masons to work about three times as quickly and with the least amount of effort th centuryedit frederick winslow taylor frederick winslow taylor the father of scientific management introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment in principles of scientific management  taylor said and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates or by implication cutting wages or discharging workers when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it shigeo shingo the bestknown exponent of single minute exchange of die and errorproofing or pokayoke cites principles of scientific management as his inspirationneed quotation to verify american industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to american workers during the s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure henry towne past president of the american society of mechanical engineers wrote in the foreword to frederick winslow taylors shop management  we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processescitation needed henry fordedit henry ford henry ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system charles buxton going wrote in  fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer ford in my life and work  provided a singleparagraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about  of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste a former employee harry bennett wrote one day when mr ford and i were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the d t  i railroad this slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces you know mr ford said to me theres iron in that slag you make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over and take it back to the plant in other words ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron fords early success however was not sustainable as james p womack and daniel jones pointed out in lean thinking what ford accomplished represented the special case rather than a robust lean solutionpage needed the major challenge that ford faced was that his methods were built for a steadystate environment rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today although his rigid topdown controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels his approach did not respond well to uncertain dynamic business conditions they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation this was made clear by fords precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a followon to the model t design for manufacture dfm is a concept derived from ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in my life and workcitation needed this standardization was central to fords concept of mass production and the manufacturing tolerances or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing decades later the renowned japanese quality guru genichi taguchi demonstrated that this goal post method of measuring was inadequate he showed that loss in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances but increased as described by the taguchi loss function at any condition exceeding the nominal condition this became an important part of w edwards demings quality movement of the s later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as cycle time variation in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries while ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters work to make the production line possible until ford a cars components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use so that they would connect properly by enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture he eliminated this work almost entirely reducing manufacturing effort by between  however fords mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of pull production and thus often suffered from overproduction toyota develops tpsedit sakichi toyoda toyotas development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the th century with sakichi toyoda in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke this became the seed of autonomation and jidoka toyotas journey with justintime jit may have started back in  when it moved from textiles to produce its first car kiichiro toyoda founder of toyota motor corporation directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing he decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process in  when toyota won its first truck contract with the japanese government his processes hit new problems and he developed the kaizen improvement teams levels of demand in the post war economy of japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application having visited and seen supermarkets in the usa taiichi ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales given the financial situation during this period overproduction had to be avoided and thus the notion of pull build to order rather than target driven push came to underpin production scheduling it was with taiichi ohno at toyota that these themes came together he built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the toyota production system tps it is principally from the tps which was widely referred to in the s as justintime manufacturing but now including many other sources that lean production is developing norman bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of fords today and tomorrowcitation needed i was first introduced to the concepts of justintime jit and the toyota production system in  subsequently i had the opportunity to witness its actual application at toyota on one of our numerous japanese study missions there i met mr taiichi ohno the systems creator when bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking he just laughed and said he learned it all from henry fords book the scale rigor and continuous learning aspects of tps have made it a core concept of lean types of wasteedit although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified this then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim the elimination of waste is the goal of lean and toyota defined three broad types of waste muda muri and mura it should be noted that for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits to illustrate the state of this thinking shigeo shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement this ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between valueadding activity waste and nonvalueadding workneed quotation to verify nonvalue adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions one key is to measure or estimate the size of these wastes to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal the flow or smoothness based approach aims to achieve jit by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver rationale or target and priorities for implementation using a variety of techniques the effort to achieve jit exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks by forcing smooth flow of only valueadding steps these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization such as carrying heavy weights moving things around dangerous tasks even working significantly faster than usual it is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits this may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations to link these three concepts is simple in tps and thus lean firstly muri focuses on the preparation and planning of the process or what work can be avoided proactively by design next mura then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level such as quality and volume muda is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively it is seen through variation in output it is the role of management to examine the muda in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the muri and mura of the system the muda and mura inconsistencies must be fed back to the muri or planning stage for the next project a typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of making the numbers as the end of a reporting period approaches demand is raised to make plan increasing mura when the numbers are low which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched this stretch and improvisation leads to muristyle waste which leads to downtime mistakes and back flows and waiting thus the muda of waiting correction and movement the original seven mudas tim wood are transport moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing inventory all components work in process and finished product not being processed motion people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing waiting waiting for the next production step interruptions of production during shift change overproduction production ahead of demand over processing resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity defects the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects eventually an eighth muda was defined by womack et al  it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications many others have added the waste of unused human talent to the original seven wastes for example six sigma includes the waste of skills referred to as underutilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training other additional wastes added were for example space these wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by taiichi ohno in tps but were found to be useful additions in practice in  geoffrey mika in his book kaizen event implementation manual added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted the waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of participative management and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers not having the proper software training on use and time spent surfing playing games or just wasting time for a complete listing of the old and new wastes see bicheno and holweg  the identification of nonvalueadding work as distinct from wasted work is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course breakthroughs in smed and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challengedcitation needed lean implementation develops from tpsedit lean leadershipedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking experienced kaizen members at toyota for example often bring up the concepts of senpai kohai and sensei because they strongly feel that transferring of toyota culture down and across toyota can only happen when more experienced toyota sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions one of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators kpi the kpis by which a plantfacility are judged will often be driving behaviour because the kpis themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done this can be an issue where for example a truly lean fixed repeating schedule frs and jit approach is adopted because these kpis will no longer reflect performance as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid it is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this kpi chaos within the organization similarly commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean lean accounting provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting after formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the toyota production system tps toyota formalized in  the basis of its lean management the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run these core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of continuous improvement relentless elimination of waste and respect for people engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust this formalization stems from problem solving as toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past  years it hit the same problems in getting tps properly applied that other western companies have had in copying tps like any other problem it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern these countermeasures have focused on culture how people behave which is the most difficult challenge of all without the proper behavioral principles and values tps can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results as with tps the values had originally been passed down in a masterdisciple manner from boss to subordinate without any written statement on the way just as with tps it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding however as toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of tps toyota set to put the toyota way into writing to educate new joiners continuous improvement breaks down into three basic principles challenge having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize ones ambition what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge to do so we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals kaizen good enough never is no process can ever be thought perfect so operations must be improved continuously striving for innovation and evolution genchi genbutsu going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions create consensus and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed respect for people is less known outside of toyota and essentially involves two defining principles respect taking every stakeholders problems seriously and making every effort to build mutual trust taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives teamwork this is about developing individuals through team problemsolving the idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance shop floor teams the whole site as team and team toyota at the outset differences from tpsedit while lean is seen by many as a generalization of the toyota production system into other industries and contexts there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementationcitation needed seeking profit is a relentless focus for toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle price – cost  profit and the need therefore to practice systematic cost reduction through tps or otherwise to realize benefit lean implementations can tend to deemphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of flow or pull however the emergence of the value curve analysis promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottomline performance measurements tool orientation is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools standardized work value stream mapping visual control etc to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent the tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems the tools employed at toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with as each tools limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood so for example value stream mapping focuses upon material and information flow problems a title built into the toyota title for this activity but is not strong on metrics man or method internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality downtime personnel development cross training related issues capacity bottlenecks or anything to do with profits safety metrics or morale etc no one tool can do all of that for surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used management technique rather than change agents has been a principle in toyota from the early s when they started emphasizing the development of the production managers and supervisors skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon stafflevel change agents to drive improvements this can manifest itself as a push implementation of lean rather than pull by the team itself this area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist but that of the natural operations work team leader although less prestigious than the tps specialists development of work team supervisors in toyota is considered an equally if not more important topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals specifically it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in toyota since they lead the daily work areas and they directly and dramatically affect quality cost productivity safety and morale of the team environment in many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true emphasis is put on developing the specialist while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own lack of understanding is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the west fail to bring any benefit in factory physics hopp and spearman describe this as romantic jit where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results in this aspect lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science others have compared it to cargo cult science lean servicesedit main article lean services lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services for example call center services use these principles to improve live agent call handling by combining agentassisted automation and leans waste reduction practices a company reduced handle time reduced between agent variability reduced accent barriers and attained near perfect process adherence lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology it more generally the use of lean in information technology has become known as lean itcitation needed lean methods are also applicable to the public sector but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean providespage needed the challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have this makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation however some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean despite this it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of techniques or tools need to be better translated into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors the upshot of this is that each implementation often feels its way along as must the early industrial engineering practices of toyota this places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developmentscitation needed lean management is nowadays implemented also in nonmanufacturing processes and administrative processes in nonmanufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase goals and strategyedit the espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors while some maintain an internal focus eg to increase profit for the organization others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer some commonly mentioned goals arecitation needed improve quality to stay competitive in todays marketplace a company must understand its customers wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements eliminate waste waste is any activity that consumes time resources or space but does not add any value to the product or service reduce time reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs reduce total costs to minimize cost a company must produce only to customer demand overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs the strategic elements of lean can be quite complex and comprise multiple elements four different notions of lean have been identified lean as a fixed state or goal being lean lean as a continuous change process becoming lean lean as a set of tools or methods doing leantoolbox lean lean as a philosophy lean thinking examples lean strategy in the global supply chain and its

supply chain and outsource scale information technology is necessary and can deal with most of hard lean practices to synchronise pull system in supply chains and value system the manufacturing industry can renew and change strategy of production just in time the supply chains take changes in deploying second factory or warehouse near their major markets in order to react consumers’ need

involvement built between global firms and suppliers intensively to connect with consumers markets efficiently crisisedit after years of success of toyota’s lean production the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought toyota to the position of being the worlds biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion in  the crisis of safetyrelated problems in toyota made other carmakers that duplicated toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them james womack had warned toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems indeed the crisis cost a great fortune and left toyota thinking whether the jit practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of japan that is proven as the economy of scale becomes global the softlearn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers if they could keep good sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection otherwise toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component it might bring more safety on riskcontrol and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future the appliance of jit in supply chain system is the key issue of lean implementation in global scale how do the supply partners avoid causing production flow global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of production flow at the same timecitation needed steps to achieve lean systemsedit the following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system design a simple manufacturing system recognize that there is always room for improvement continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design design a simple manufacturing systemedit a fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demandbased flow manufacturing in this type of production setting inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customers order the benefits of this goal include decreased cycle time less inventory increased productivity increased capital equipment utilization continuous improvementedit a continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the companys goals the term continuous improvement means incremental improvement of products processes or services over time with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality customer service or product performance lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities the value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for everything else is waste and should be eliminated simplified reduced or integrated rizzardo full citation needed improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customers required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventoryneed quotation to verify measureedit overall equipment effectiveness oee is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment also pmts methodstime measurement cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and it effectiveness in the operational processes for example juning ker and yichuan wang analyze two prescribing technologies namely no carbon required ncr and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering transcribing and dispensing process in a multihospital health system with comparison between these two technologiesthe statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology the results indicated a reduction of  in queue time  in order entry time  in outgoing delay time and  in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology implementation dilemmaedit one criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean consequently adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel as a result lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation in addition many of the popular lean initiatives coming from the tps are solutions to specific problems that toyota was facing toyota having an undesired current condition determined what the end state would look like through much study the gap was closed which resulted in many of the tools in place today often when a tool is implemented outside of tps a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives the tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed thus the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs the actual root cause the lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance value stream mapping vsm and s are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes or cover the entire supply chain for example you might start from analysis of skus using several days to identify and draw each skus path evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer conducting a gap analysis determines the companys must take steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective based on that evaluation the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis fmea in order to identify and prevent risk factors it is crucial for frontline workers to be involved in vsm activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity after adopting the lean approach both managers and employees experience change therefore decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey there are several requirements to control the lean journey first and most importantly experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan developed by the lean leadership in other words the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement second coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey they will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient third the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important it will enable collection of the data required for informed decisionmaking by a leader one cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs to control and improve results going forward one must see and measure ie map what is happening now lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises one distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting for standard cost accounting skus are difficult to grasp skus include too much hypothesis and variance ie skus hold too much indeterminacy manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting in using lean accounting one expected gain is activitybased cost visibility ie measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and suppliescitation needed see alsoedit a problem solving

systematic method for waste minimization muda within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity lean also takes into account waste created through overburden muri and waste created through unevenness in work loads mura working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service value is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for lean manufacturing makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which is not adding value this management philosophy is derived mostly from the toyota production system tps and identified as lean only in the s tps is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved the steady growth of toyota from a small company to the worlds largest automaker has focused attention on how it has achieved this success contents  overview  history  preth century  th century  henry

reading  external links overviewedit lean principles are derived from the japanese manufacturing industry the term was first coined by john krafcik in his  article triumph of the lean production system based on his masters thesis at the mit sloan school of management krafcik had been a quality engineer in the toyotagm nummi joint venture in california before joining mit for mba studies krafciks research was continued by the international motor vehicle program imvp at mit which produced the international bestselling book coauthored by jim womack daniel jones and daniel roos called the machine that changed the world a complete historical account of the imvp and how the term lean was coined is given by holweg  for many lean is the set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced a non exhaustive list of such tools would include smed value stream mapping five s kanban pull systems pokayoke errorproofing total productive maintenance elimination of time batching mixed model processing rank order clustering single point scheduling redesigning working cells multiprocess handling and control charts for checking mura there is a second approach to lean manufacturing which is promoted by toyota called the toyota way in which the focus is upon improving the flow or smoothness of work thereby steadily eliminating mura unevenness through the system and not upon waste reduction per se techniques to improve flow include production leveling pull production by means of kanban and the heijunka box this is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools which may partially account for its lack of popularity the difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself but rather the prime approach to achieving it the implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence the advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a systemwide perspective whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective both lean and tps can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste these principles include pull processing perfect firsttime quality waste minimization continuous improvement flexibility building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers autonomation load leveling and production flow and visual control the disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the tps has grown pragmatically since  as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities thus what one sees today is the result of a need driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework toyotas view is that the main method of lean is not the tools but the reduction of three types of waste muda nonvalueadding work muri overburden and mura unevenness to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved from this perspective the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles abovecitation needed also known as the flexible mass production the tps has two pillar concepts justintime jit or flow and autonomation smart automationfull citation needed adherents of the toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as sideeffects if production flows perfectly meaning it is both pull and with no interruptions then there is no inventory if customer valued features are the only ones produced then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values the other of the two tps pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation whereby automation is achieved with a human touchfull citation needed in this instance the human touch means to automate so that the machinessystems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable flexibility is required to allow production leveling heijunka using tools such as smed but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development rd however adaptability is often constrained and therefore may not require significant investment more importantly all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value the cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself there are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand perform and manage the work environment to achieve these three goals simultaneously one of toyotas mentoring methodologies loosely called senpai and kohai which is japanese for senior and junior can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up the closest equivalent to toyotas mentoring process is the concept of lean sensei which encourages companies organizations and teams to seek thirdparty experts that can provide advice and coaching in  spear and bowen identified four rules which characterizes the toyota dna all work shall be highly specified as to content sequence timing and outcome every customersupplier connection must be direct and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses the pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method under the guidance of a teacher at the lowest possible level in the organization historyedit preth centuryedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the printer benjamin franklin contributed greatly to waste reduction thinking most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from benjamin franklin through documented examples poor richards almanack says of wasted time he that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently throw s into the river he added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales a penny saved is two pence clear a pin aday is a groat ayear save and have again franklins the way to wealth says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths henry ford cited franklin as a major influence on his own business practices which included justintime manufacturing the accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert frank gilbreth who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground the introduction of a nonstooping scaffold which delivered the bricks at waist level allowed masons to work about three times as quickly and with the least amount of effort th centuryedit frederick winslow taylor frederick winslow taylor the father of scientific management introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment in principles of scientific management  taylor said and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates or by implication cutting wages or discharging workers when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it shigeo shingo the bestknown exponent of single minute exchange of die and errorproofing or pokayoke cites principles of scientific management as his inspirationneed quotation to verify american industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to american workers during the s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure henry towne past president of the american society of mechanical engineers wrote in the foreword to frederick winslow taylors shop management  we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processescitation needed henry fordedit henry ford henry ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system charles buxton going wrote in  fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer ford in my life and work  provided a singleparagraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about  of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste a former employee harry bennett wrote one day when mr ford and i were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the d t  i railroad this slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces you know mr ford said to me theres iron in that slag you make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over and take it back to the plant in other words ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron fords early success however was not sustainable as james p womack and daniel jones pointed out in lean thinking what ford accomplished represented the special case rather than a robust lean solutionpage needed the major challenge that ford faced was that his methods were built for a steadystate environment rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today although his rigid topdown controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels his approach did not respond well to uncertain dynamic business conditions they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation this was made clear by fords precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a followon to the model t design for manufacture dfm is a concept derived from ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in my life and workcitation needed this standardization was central to fords concept of mass production and the manufacturing tolerances or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing decades later the renowned japanese quality guru genichi taguchi demonstrated that this goal post method of measuring was inadequate he showed that loss in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances but increased as described by the taguchi loss function at any condition exceeding the nominal condition this became an important part of w edwards demings quality movement of the s later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as cycle time variation in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries while ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters work to make the production line possible until ford a cars components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use so that they would connect properly by enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture he eliminated this work almost entirely reducing manufacturing effort by between  however fords mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of pull production and thus often suffered from overproduction toyota develops tpsedit sakichi toyoda toyotas development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the th century with sakichi toyoda in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke this became the seed of autonomation and jidoka toyotas journey with justintime jit may have started back in  when it moved from textiles to produce its first car kiichiro toyoda founder of toyota motor corporation directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing he decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process in  when toyota won its first truck contract with the japanese government his processes hit new problems and he developed the kaizen improvement teams levels of demand in the post war economy of japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application having visited and seen supermarkets in the usa taiichi ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales given the financial situation during this period overproduction had to be avoided and thus the notion of pull build to order rather than target driven push came to underpin production scheduling it was with taiichi ohno at toyota that these themes came together he built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the toyota production system tps it is principally from the tps which was widely referred to in the s as justintime manufacturing but now including many other sources that lean production is developing norman bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of fords today and tomorrowcitation needed i was first introduced to the concepts of justintime jit and the toyota production system in  subsequently i had the opportunity to witness its actual application at toyota on one of our numerous japanese study missions there i met mr taiichi ohno the systems creator when bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking he just laughed and said he learned it all from henry fords book the scale rigor and continuous learning aspects of tps have made it a core concept of lean types of wasteedit although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified this then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim the elimination of waste is the goal of lean and toyota defined three broad types of waste muda muri and mura it should be noted that for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits to illustrate the state of this thinking shigeo shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement this ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between valueadding activity waste and nonvalueadding workneed quotation to verify nonvalue adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions one key is to measure or estimate the size of these wastes to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal the flow or smoothness based approach aims to achieve jit by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver rationale or target and priorities for implementation using a variety of techniques the effort to achieve jit exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks by forcing smooth flow of only valueadding steps these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization such as carrying heavy weights moving things around dangerous tasks even working significantly faster than usual it is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits this may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations to link these three concepts is simple in tps and thus lean firstly muri focuses on the preparation and planning of the process or what work can be avoided proactively by design next mura then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level such as quality and volume muda is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively it is seen through variation in output it is the role of management to examine the muda in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the muri and mura of the system the muda and mura inconsistencies must be fed back to the muri or planning stage for the next project a typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of making the numbers as the end of a reporting period approaches demand is raised to make plan increasing mura when the numbers are low which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched this stretch and improvisation leads to muristyle waste which leads to downtime mistakes and back flows and waiting thus the muda of waiting correction and movement the original seven mudas tim wood are transport moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing inventory all components work in process and finished product not being processed motion people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing waiting waiting for the next production step interruptions of production during shift change overproduction production ahead of demand over processing resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity defects the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects eventually an eighth muda was defined by womack et al  it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications many others have added the waste of unused human talent to the original seven wastes for example six sigma includes the waste of skills referred to as underutilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training other additional wastes added were for example space these wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by taiichi ohno in tps but were found to be useful additions in practice in  geoffrey mika in his book kaizen event implementation manual added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted the waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of participative management and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers not having the proper software training on use and time spent surfing playing games or just wasting time for a complete listing of the old and new wastes see bicheno and holweg  the identification of nonvalueadding work as distinct from wasted work is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course breakthroughs in smed and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challengedcitation needed lean implementation develops from tpsedit lean leadershipedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking experienced kaizen members at toyota for example often bring up the concepts of senpai kohai and sensei because they strongly feel that transferring of toyota culture down and across toyota can only happen when more experienced toyota sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions one of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators kpi the kpis by which a plantfacility are judged will often be driving behaviour because the kpis themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done this can be an issue where for example a truly lean fixed repeating schedule frs and jit approach is adopted because these kpis will no longer reflect performance as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid it is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this kpi chaos within the organization similarly commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean lean accounting provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting after formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the toyota production system tps toyota formalized in  the basis of its lean management the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run these core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of continuous improvement relentless elimination of waste and respect for people engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust this formalization stems from problem solving as toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past  years it hit the same problems in getting tps properly applied that other western companies have had in copying tps like any other problem it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern these countermeasures have focused on culture how people behave which is the most difficult challenge of all without the proper behavioral principles and values tps can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results as with tps the values had originally been passed down in a masterdisciple manner from boss to subordinate without any written statement on the way just as with tps it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding however as toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of tps toyota set to put the toyota way into writing to educate new joiners continuous improvement breaks down into three basic principles challenge having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize ones ambition what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge to do so we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals kaizen good enough never is no process can ever be thought perfect so operations must be improved continuously striving for innovation and evolution genchi genbutsu going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions create consensus and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed respect for people is less known outside of toyota and essentially involves two defining principles respect taking every stakeholders problems seriously and making every effort to build mutual trust taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives teamwork this is about developing individuals through team problemsolving the idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance shop floor teams the whole site as team and team toyota at the outset differences from tpsedit while lean is seen by many as a generalization of the toyota production system into other industries and contexts there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementationcitation needed seeking profit is a relentless focus for toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle price – cost  profit and the need therefore to practice systematic cost reduction through tps or otherwise to realize benefit lean implementations can tend to deemphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of flow or pull however the emergence of the value curve analysis promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottomline performance measurements tool orientation is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools standardized work value stream mapping visual control etc to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent the tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems the tools employed at toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with as each tools limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood so for example value stream mapping focuses upon material and information flow problems a title built into the toyota title for this activity but is not strong on metrics man or method internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality downtime personnel development cross training related issues capacity bottlenecks or anything to do with profits safety metrics or morale etc no one tool can do all of that for surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used management technique rather than change agents has been a principle in toyota from the early s when they started emphasizing the development of the production managers and supervisors skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon stafflevel change agents to drive improvements this can manifest itself as a push implementation of lean rather than pull by the team itself this area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist but that of the natural operations work team leader although less prestigious than the tps specialists development of work team supervisors in toyota is considered an equally if not more important topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals specifically it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in toyota since they lead the daily work areas and they directly and dramatically affect quality cost productivity safety and morale of the team environment in many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true emphasis is put on developing the specialist while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own lack of understanding is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the west fail to bring any benefit in factory physics hopp and spearman describe this as romantic jit where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results in this aspect lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science others have compared it to cargo cult science lean servicesedit main article lean services lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services for example call center services use these principles to improve live agent call handling by combining agentassisted automation and leans waste reduction practices a company reduced handle time reduced between agent variability reduced accent barriers and attained near perfect process adherence lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology it more generally the use of lean in information technology has become known as lean itcitation needed lean methods are also applicable to the public sector but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean providespage needed the challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have this makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation however some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean despite this it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of techniques or tools need to be better translated into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors the upshot of this is that each implementation often feels its way along as must the early industrial engineering practices of toyota this places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developmentscitation needed lean management is nowadays implemented also in nonmanufacturing processes and administrative processes in nonmanufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase goals and strategyedit the espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors while some maintain an internal focus eg to increase profit for the organization others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer some commonly mentioned goals arecitation needed improve quality to stay competitive in todays marketplace a company must understand its customers wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements eliminate waste waste is any activity that consumes time resources or space but does not add any value to the product or service reduce time reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs reduce total costs to minimize cost a company must produce only to customer demand overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs the strategic elements of lean can be quite complex and comprise multiple elements four different notions of lean have been identified lean as a fixed state or goal being lean

supply chain and outsource scale information technology is necessary and can deal with most of hard lean practices to synchronise pull system in supply chains and value system the manufacturing industry can renew and change strategy of production just in time the supply chains take changes in deploying second factory or warehouse near their major markets in order to react consumers’ need promptly instead of investing manufacturing factories on the lostcost countries for instance dell sells computers directly from their website cutting franchised dealers out of their supply chains then the firm use outsourced partners to produce its components deliver components to their assembly plants on these main markets around the world like america and china zara made decision of speeding their fashion to the consumers market by fastproducing cloths within five weeks with their local partners in spain and never involved in mass production to pursue new styles and keep products fresh

system of stocks directly to the suppliers companiesneed quotation to verify with the improvement of global scale supply chains firms apply lean practices jit supplier partnership and customer involvement built between global firms and suppliers intensively to connect with consumers markets efficiently crisisedit after years of success of toyota’s lean production the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought toyota to the position of being the worlds biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion in  the crisis of safetyrelated problems in toyota made other carmakers that duplicated toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them james womack had warned toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems indeed the crisis cost a great fortune and left toyota thinking whether the jit practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of japan that is proven as the economy of scale becomes global the softlearn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers if they could keep good sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection otherwise toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component it might bring more safety on riskcontrol and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future the appliance of jit in supply chain system is the key issue of lean implementation in global scale how do the supply partners avoid causing production flow global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of production flow at the same timecitation needed steps to achieve lean systemsedit the following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system design a simple manufacturing system recognize that there is always room for improvement continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design design a simple manufacturing systemedit a fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demandbased flow manufacturing in this type of production setting inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customers order the benefits of this goal include decreased cycle time less inventory increased productivity increased capital equipment utilization continuous improvementedit a continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the companys goals the term continuous improvement means incremental improvement of products processes or services over time with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality customer service or product performance lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities the value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for everything else is waste and should be eliminated simplified reduced or integrated rizzardo full citation needed improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customers required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventoryneed quotation to verify measureedit overall equipment effectiveness oee is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment also pmts methodstime measurement cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and it effectiveness in the operational processes for example juning ker and yichuan wang analyze two prescribing technologies namely no carbon required ncr and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering transcribing and dispensing process in a multihospital health system with comparison between these two technologiesthe statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology the results indicated a reduction of  in queue time  in order entry time  in outgoing delay time and  in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology implementation dilemmaedit one criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean consequently adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel as a result lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation in addition many of the popular lean initiatives coming from the tps are solutions to specific problems that toyota was facing toyota having an undesired current condition determined what the end state would look like through much study the gap was closed which resulted in many of the tools in place today often when a tool is implemented outside of tps a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives the tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed thus the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs the actual root cause the lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance value stream mapping vsm and s are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes or cover the entire supply chain for example you might start from analysis of skus using several days to identify and draw each skus path evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer conducting a gap analysis determines the companys must take steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective based on that evaluation the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis fmea in order to identify and prevent risk factors it is crucial for frontline workers to be involved in vsm activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity after adopting the lean approach both managers and employees experience change therefore decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey there are several requirements to control the lean journey first and most importantly experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan developed by the lean leadership in other words the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement second coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey they will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient third the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important it will enable collection of the data required for informed decisionmaking by a leader one cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs to control and improve results going forward one must see and measure ie map what is happening now lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises one distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting for standard cost accounting skus are difficult to grasp skus include too much hypothesis and variance ie skus hold too much indeterminacy manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting in using lean accounting one expected gain is activitybased cost visibility ie measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and suppliescitation needed see alsoedit a problem solving

systematic method for waste minimization muda within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity lean also takes into account waste created through overburden muri and waste created through unevenness in work loads mura working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service value is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for lean manufacturing makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which is not adding value this management philosophy is derived mostly from the toyota production system tps and identified as lean only in the s tps is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved the steady growth of toyota from a small company to the worlds largest automaker has focused attention on how it has achieved this success contents  overview  history  preth century  th century  henry

reading  external links overviewedit lean principles are derived from the japanese manufacturing industry the term was first coined by john krafcik in his  article triumph of the lean production system based on his masters thesis at the mit sloan school of management krafcik had been a quality engineer in the toyotagm nummi joint venture in california before joining mit for mba studies krafciks research was continued by the international motor vehicle program imvp at mit which produced the international bestselling book coauthored by jim womack daniel jones and daniel roos called the machine that changed the world a complete historical account of the imvp and how the term lean was coined is given by holweg  for many lean is the set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced a non exhaustive list of such tools would include smed value stream mapping five s kanban pull systems pokayoke errorproofing total productive maintenance elimination of time batching mixed model processing rank order clustering single point scheduling redesigning working cells multiprocess handling and control charts for checking mura there is a second approach to lean manufacturing which is promoted by toyota called the toyota way in which the focus is upon improving the flow or smoothness of work thereby steadily eliminating mura unevenness through the system and not upon waste reduction per se techniques to improve flow include production leveling pull production by means of kanban and the heijunka box this is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools which may partially account for its lack of popularity the difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself but rather the prime approach to achieving it the implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence the advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a systemwide perspective whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective both lean and tps can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste these principles include pull processing perfect firsttime quality waste minimization continuous improvement flexibility building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers autonomation load leveling and production flow and visual control the disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the tps has grown pragmatically since  as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities thus what one sees today is the result of a need driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework toyotas view is that the main method of lean is not the tools but the reduction of three types of waste muda nonvalueadding work muri overburden and mura unevenness to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved from this perspective the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles abovecitation needed also known as the flexible mass production the tps has two pillar concepts justintime jit or flow and autonomation smart automationfull citation needed adherents of the toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as sideeffects if production flows perfectly meaning it is both pull and with no interruptions then there is no inventory if customer valued features are the only ones produced then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values the other of the two tps pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation whereby automation is achieved with a human touchfull citation needed in this instance the human touch means to automate so that the machinessystems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable flexibility is required to allow production leveling heijunka using tools such as smed but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development rd however adaptability is often constrained and therefore may not require significant investment more importantly all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value the cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself there are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand perform and manage the work environment to achieve these three goals simultaneously one of toyotas mentoring methodologies loosely called senpai and kohai which is japanese for senior and junior can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up the closest equivalent to toyotas mentoring process is the concept of lean sensei which encourages companies organizations and teams to seek thirdparty experts that can provide advice and coaching in  spear and bowen identified four rules which characterizes the toyota dna all work shall be highly specified as to content sequence timing and outcome every customersupplier connection must be direct and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses the pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct any improvement must be made in accordance with the

by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the printer benjamin franklin contributed greatly to waste reduction thinking most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from benjamin franklin through documented examples poor richards almanack says of wasted time he that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently throw s into the river he added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales a penny saved is two pence clear a pin aday is a groat ayear save and have again franklins the way to wealth says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths henry ford cited franklin as a major influence on his own business practices which included justintime manufacturing the accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert frank gilbreth who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground the introduction of a nonstooping scaffold which delivered the bricks at waist level allowed masons to work about three times as quickly and with the least amount of effort th centuryedit frederick winslow taylor frederick winslow taylor the father of scientific management introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment in principles of scientific management  taylor said and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates or by implication cutting wages or discharging workers when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it shigeo shingo the bestknown exponent of single minute exchange of die and errorproofing or pokayoke cites principles of scientific management as his inspirationneed quotation to verify american industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to american workers during the s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure henry towne past president of the american society of mechanical engineers wrote in the foreword to frederick winslow taylors shop management  we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processescitation needed henry fordedit henry ford henry ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system charles buxton going wrote in  fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer ford in my life and work  provided a singleparagraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about  of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste a former employee harry bennett wrote one day when mr ford and i were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the d t  i railroad this slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces you know mr ford said to me theres iron in that slag you make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over and take it back to the plant in other words ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron fords early success however was not sustainable as james p womack and daniel jones pointed out in lean thinking what ford accomplished represented the special case rather than a robust lean solutionpage needed the major challenge that ford faced was that his methods were built for a steadystate environment rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today although his rigid topdown controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels his approach did not respond well to uncertain dynamic business conditions they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation this was made clear by fords precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a followon to the model t design for manufacture dfm is a concept derived from ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in my life and workcitation needed this standardization was central to fords concept of mass production and the manufacturing tolerances or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing decades later the renowned japanese quality guru genichi taguchi demonstrated that this goal post method of measuring was inadequate he showed that loss in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances but increased as described by the taguchi loss function at any condition exceeding the nominal condition this became an important part of w edwards demings quality movement of the s later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as cycle time variation in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries while ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters work to make the production line possible until ford a cars components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use so that they would connect properly by enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture he eliminated this work almost entirely reducing manufacturing effort by between  however fords mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of pull production and thus often suffered from overproduction toyota develops tpsedit sakichi toyoda toyotas development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the th century with sakichi toyoda in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke this became the seed of autonomation and jidoka toyotas journey with justintime jit may have started back in  when it moved from textiles to produce its first car kiichiro toyoda founder of toyota motor corporation directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing he decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process in  when toyota won its first truck contract with the japanese government his processes hit new problems and he developed the kaizen improvement teams levels of demand in the post war economy of japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application having visited and seen supermarkets in the usa taiichi ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales given the financial situation during this period overproduction had to be avoided and thus the notion of pull build to order rather than target driven push came to underpin production scheduling it was with taiichi ohno at toyota that these themes came together he built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the toyota production system tps it is principally from the tps which was widely referred to in the s as justintime manufacturing but now including many other sources that lean production is developing norman bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of fords today and tomorrowcitation needed i was first introduced to the concepts of justintime jit and the toyota production system in  subsequently i had the opportunity to witness its actual application at toyota on one of our numerous japanese study missions there i met mr taiichi ohno the systems creator when bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking he just laughed and said he learned it all from henry fords book the scale rigor and continuous learning aspects of tps have made it a core concept of lean types of wasteedit although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified this then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim the elimination of waste is the goal of lean and toyota defined three broad types of waste muda muri and mura it should be noted that for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits to illustrate the state of this thinking shigeo shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement this ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between valueadding activity waste and nonvalueadding workneed quotation to verify nonvalue adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions one key is to measure or estimate the size of these wastes to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal the flow or smoothness based approach aims to achieve jit by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver rationale or target and priorities for implementation using a variety of techniques the effort to achieve jit exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks by forcing smooth flow of only valueadding steps these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization such as carrying heavy weights moving things around dangerous tasks even working significantly faster than usual it is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits this may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations to link these three concepts is simple in tps and thus lean firstly muri focuses on the preparation and planning of the process or what work can be avoided proactively by design next mura then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level such as quality and volume muda is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively it is seen through variation in output it is the role of management to examine the muda in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the muri and mura of the system the muda and mura inconsistencies must be fed back to the muri or planning stage for the next project a typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of making the numbers as the end of a reporting period approaches demand is raised to make plan increasing mura when the numbers are low which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched this stretch and improvisation leads to muristyle waste which leads to downtime mistakes and back flows and waiting thus the muda of waiting correction and movement the original seven mudas tim wood are transport moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing inventory all components work in process and finished product not being processed motion people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing waiting waiting for the next production step interruptions of production during shift change overproduction production ahead of demand over processing resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity defects the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects eventually an eighth muda was defined by womack et al  it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications many others have added the waste of unused human talent to the original seven wastes for example six sigma includes the waste of skills referred to as underutilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training other additional wastes added were for example space these wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by taiichi ohno in tps but were found to be useful additions in practice in  geoffrey mika in his book kaizen event implementation manual added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted the waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of participative management and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers not having the proper software training on use and time spent surfing playing games or just wasting time for a complete listing of the old and new wastes see bicheno and holweg  the identification of nonvalueadding work as distinct from wasted work is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course breakthroughs in smed and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challengedcitation needed lean implementation develops from tpsedit lean leadershipedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking experienced kaizen members at toyota for example often bring up the concepts of senpai kohai and sensei because they strongly feel that transferring of toyota culture down and across toyota can only happen when more experienced toyota sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions one of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators kpi the kpis by which a plantfacility are judged will often be driving behaviour because the kpis themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done this can be an issue where for example a truly lean fixed repeating schedule frs and jit approach is adopted because these kpis will no longer reflect performance as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid it is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this kpi chaos within the organization similarly commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean lean accounting provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting after formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the toyota production system tps toyota formalized in  the basis of its lean management the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run these core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of continuous improvement relentless elimination of waste and respect for people engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust this formalization stems from problem solving as toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past  years it hit the same problems in getting tps properly applied that other western companies have had in copying tps like any other problem it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern these countermeasures have focused on culture how people behave which is the most difficult challenge of all without the proper behavioral principles and values tps can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results as with tps the values had originally been passed down in a masterdisciple manner from boss to subordinate without any written statement on the way just as with tps it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding however as toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of tps toyota set to put the toyota way into writing to educate new joiners continuous improvement breaks down into three basic principles challenge having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize ones ambition what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge to do so we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals kaizen good enough never is no process can ever be thought perfect so operations must be improved continuously striving for innovation and evolution genchi genbutsu going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions create consensus and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed respect for people is less known outside of toyota and essentially involves two defining principles respect taking every stakeholders problems seriously and making every effort to build mutual trust taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives teamwork this is about developing individuals through team problemsolving the idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance shop floor teams the whole site as team and team toyota at the outset differences from tpsedit while lean is seen by many as a generalization of the toyota production system into other industries and contexts there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementationcitation needed seeking profit is a relentless focus for toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle price – cost  profit and the need therefore to practice systematic cost reduction through tps or otherwise to realize benefit lean implementations can tend to deemphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of flow or pull however the emergence of the value curve analysis promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottomline performance measurements tool orientation is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools standardized work value stream mapping visual control etc to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent the tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems the tools employed at toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with as each tools limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood so for example value stream mapping focuses upon material and information flow problems a title built into the toyota title for this activity but is not strong on metrics man or method internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality downtime personnel development cross training related issues capacity bottlenecks or anything to do with profits safety metrics or morale etc no one tool can do all of that for surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used management technique rather than change agents has been a principle in toyota from the early s when they started emphasizing the development of the production managers and supervisors skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon stafflevel change agents to drive improvements this can manifest itself as a push implementation of lean rather than pull by the team itself this area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist but that of the natural operations work team leader although less prestigious than the tps specialists development of work team supervisors in toyota is considered an equally if not more important topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals specifically it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in toyota since they lead the daily work areas and they directly and dramatically affect quality cost productivity safety and morale of the team environment in many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true emphasis is put on developing the specialist while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own lack of understanding is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the west fail to bring any benefit in factory physics hopp and spearman describe this as romantic jit where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results in this aspect lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science others have compared it to cargo cult science lean servicesedit main article lean services lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services for example call center services use these principles to improve live agent call handling by combining agentassisted automation and leans waste reduction practices a company reduced handle time reduced between agent variability reduced accent barriers and attained near perfect process adherence lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology it more generally the use of lean in information technology has become known as lean itcitation needed lean methods are also applicable to the public sector but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean providespage needed the challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have this makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation however some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean despite this it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of techniques or tools need to be better translated into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors the upshot of this is that each implementation often feels its way along as must the early industrial engineering practices of toyota this places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developmentscitation needed lean management is nowadays implemented also in nonmanufacturing processes and administrative processes in nonmanufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase goals and strategyedit the espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors while some maintain an internal focus eg to increase profit for the organization others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer some commonly mentioned goals arecitation needed improve quality to stay competitive in todays marketplace a company must understand its customers wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements eliminate waste waste is any activity that consumes time resources or space but does not add any value to the product or service reduce time reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs reduce total costs to minimize cost a company must produce only to customer demand overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs the strategic elements of lean can be quite complex and comprise multiple elements four different notions of lean have been identified lean as a fixed state or goal being lean

supply chain and outsource scale information technology is necessary and can deal with most of hard lean practices to synchronise pull system in supply chains and value system the manufacturing

system of stocks directly to the suppliers companiesneed quotation to verify with the improvement of global scale supply chains firms apply lean practices jit supplier partnership and customer involvement built between global firms and suppliers intensively to connect with consumers markets efficiently crisisedit after years of success of toyota’s lean production the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought toyota to the position of being the worlds biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion in  the crisis of safetyrelated problems in toyota made other carmakers that duplicated toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them james womack had warned toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems indeed the crisis cost a great fortune and left toyota thinking whether the jit practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of japan that is proven as the economy of scale becomes global the softlearn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers if they could keep good sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection otherwise toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component it might bring more safety on riskcontrol and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future the appliance of jit in supply chain system is the key issue of lean implementation in global scale how do the supply partners avoid causing production flow global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of production flow at the same timecitation needed steps to achieve lean systemsedit the following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system design a simple manufacturing system recognize that there is always room for improvement continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design design a simple manufacturing systemedit a fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demandbased flow manufacturing in this type of production setting inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customers order the benefits of this goal include decreased cycle time less inventory increased productivity increased capital equipment utilization continuous improvementedit a continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the companys goals the term continuous improvement means incremental improvement of products processes or services over time with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality customer service or product performance lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities the value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for everything else is waste and should be eliminated simplified reduced or integrated rizzardo full citation needed improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customers required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventoryneed quotation to verify measureedit overall equipment effectiveness oee is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment also pmts methodstime measurement cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and it effectiveness in the operational processes for example juning ker and yichuan wang analyze two prescribing technologies namely no carbon required ncr and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering transcribing and dispensing process in a multihospital health system with comparison between these two technologiesthe statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology the results indicated a reduction of  in queue time  in order entry time  in outgoing delay time and  in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology implementation dilemmaedit one criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean consequently adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel as a result lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation in addition many of the popular lean initiatives coming from the tps are solutions to specific problems that toyota was facing toyota having an undesired current condition determined what the end state would look like through much study the gap was closed which resulted in many of the tools in place today often when a tool is implemented outside of tps a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives the tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed thus the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs the actual root cause the lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance value stream mapping vsm and s are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes or cover the entire supply chain for example you might start from analysis of skus using several days to identify and draw each skus path evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer conducting a gap analysis determines the companys must take steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective based on that evaluation the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis fmea in order to identify and prevent risk factors it is crucial for frontline workers to be involved in vsm activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity after adopting the lean approach both managers and employees experience change therefore decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey there are several requirements to control the lean journey first and most importantly experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan developed by the lean leadership in other words the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement second coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey they will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient third the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important it will enable collection of the data required for informed decisionmaking by a leader one cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs to control and improve results going forward one must see and measure ie map what is happening now lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises one distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting for standard cost accounting skus are difficult to grasp skus include too much hypothesis and variance ie skus hold too much indeterminacy manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting in using lean accounting one expected gain is activitybased cost visibility ie measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and suppliescitation needed see alsoedit a problem solving

systematic method for waste minimization muda within a manufacturing system without sacrificing productivity lean also takes into account waste created through overburden muri and waste created through unevenness in work loads mura working from the perspective of the client who consumes a product or service value is any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for lean manufacturing makes obvious what adds value by reducing everything else which is not adding value this management philosophy is derived mostly from the toyota production system tps and identified as lean only in the s tps is renowned for its focus on reduction of the original toyota seven wastes to improve overall customer value but there are varying perspectives on how this is best achieved the steady growth of toyota from a small company to the worlds largest automaker has focused attention on how it has achieved this success contents  overview  history  preth century  th century  henry

reading  external links overviewedit lean principles are derived from the japanese manufacturing industry the term was first coined by john krafcik in his  article triumph of the lean production system based on his masters thesis at the mit sloan school of management krafcik had been a quality engineer in the toyotagm nummi joint venture in california before joining mit for mba studies krafciks research was continued by the international motor vehicle program imvp at mit which produced the international bestselling book coauthored by jim womack daniel jones and daniel roos called the machine that changed the world a complete historical account of the imvp and how the term lean was coined is given by holweg  for many lean is the set of tools that assist in the identification and steady elimination of waste as waste is eliminated quality improves while production time and cost are reduced a non exhaustive list of such tools would include smed value stream mapping five s kanban pull systems pokayoke errorproofing total productive maintenance elimination of time batching mixed model processing rank order clustering single point scheduling redesigning working cells multiprocess handling and control charts for checking mura there is a second approach to lean manufacturing which is promoted by toyota called the toyota way in which the focus is upon improving the flow or smoothness of work thereby steadily eliminating mura unevenness through the system and not upon waste reduction per se techniques to improve flow include production leveling pull production by means of kanban and the heijunka box this is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies and requires considerably more persistence than basic application of the tools which may partially account for its lack of popularity the difference between these two approaches is not the goal itself but rather the prime approach to achieving it the implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already existed and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence the advantage claimed for this approach is that it naturally takes a systemwide perspective whereas a waste focus sometimes wrongly assumes this perspective both lean and tps can be seen as a loosely connected set of potentially competing principles whose goal is cost reduction by the elimination of waste these principles include pull processing perfect firsttime quality waste minimization continuous improvement flexibility building and maintaining a long term relationship with suppliers autonomation load leveling and production flow and visual control the disconnected nature of some of these principles perhaps springs from the fact that the tps has grown pragmatically since  as it responded to the problems it saw within its own production facilities thus what one sees today is the result of a need driven learning to improve where each step has built on previous ideas and not something based upon a theoretical framework toyotas view is that the main method of lean is not the tools but the reduction of three types of waste muda nonvalueadding work muri overburden and mura unevenness to expose problems systematically and to use the tools where the ideal cannot be achieved from this perspective the tools are workarounds adapted to different situations which explains any apparent incoherence of the principles abovecitation needed also known as the flexible mass production the tps has two pillar concepts justintime jit or flow and autonomation smart automationfull citation needed adherents of the toyota approach would say that the smooth flowing delivery of value achieves all the other improvements as sideeffects if production flows perfectly meaning it is both pull and with no interruptions then there is no inventory if customer valued features are the only ones produced then product design is simplified and effort is only expended on features the customer values the other of the two tps pillars is the very human aspect of autonomation whereby automation is achieved with a human touchfull citation needed in this instance the human touch means to automate so that the machinessystems are designed to aid humans in focusing on what the humans do best lean implementation emphasizes the importance of optimizing work flow through strategic operational procedures while minimizing waste and being adaptable flexibility is required to allow production leveling heijunka using tools such as smed but have their analogues in other processes such as research and development rd however adaptability is often constrained and therefore may not require significant investment more importantly all of these concepts have to be acknowledged by employees who develop the products and initiate processes that deliver value the cultural and managerial aspects of lean are arguably more important than the actual tools or methodologies of production itself there are many examples of lean tool implementation without sustained benefit and these are often blamed on weak understanding of lean throughout the whole organization lean aims to enhance productivity by simplifying the operational structure enough to understand perform and manage the work environment to achieve these three goals simultaneously one of toyotas mentoring methodologies loosely called senpai and kohai which is japanese for senior and junior can be used to foster lean thinking throughout the organizational structure from the ground up the closest equivalent to toyotas mentoring process is the concept of lean sensei which encourages companies organizations and teams to seek thirdparty experts that can provide advice and coaching in  spear and bowen identified four rules which characterizes the toyota dna all work shall be highly specified as to content sequence timing and outcome every customersupplier connection must be direct and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses the pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct any improvement must be made in accordance with the

waste reduction thinking most of the basic goals of lean manufacturing and waste reduction were derived from benjamin franklin through documented examples poor richards almanack says of wasted time he that idly loses s worth of time loses s and might as prudently throw s into the river he added that avoiding unnecessary costs could be more profitable than increasing sales a penny saved is two pence clear a pin aday is a groat ayear save and have again franklins the way to wealth says the following about carrying unnecessary inventory you call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you you expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may be bought for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you remember what poor richard says buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries in another place he says many have been ruined by buying good penny worths henry ford cited franklin as a major influence on his own business practices which included justintime manufacturing the accumulation of waste and energy within the work environment was noticed by motion efficiency expert frank gilbreth who witnessed the inefficient practices of masons who often bend over to gather bricks from the ground the introduction of a nonstooping scaffold which delivered the bricks at waist level allowed masons to work about three times as quickly and with the least amount of effort th centuryedit frederick winslow taylor frederick winslow taylor the father of scientific management introduced what are now called standardization and best practice deployment in principles of scientific management  taylor said and whenever a workman proposes an improvement it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard and whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment taylor also warned explicitly against cutting piece rates or by implication cutting wages or discharging workers when efficiency improvements reduce the need for raw labor after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employers side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering marking time just doing what he is told can prevent it shigeo shingo the bestknown exponent of single minute exchange of die and errorproofing or pokayoke cites principles of scientific management as his inspirationneed quotation to verify american industrialists recognized the threat of cheap offshore labor to american workers during the s and explicitly stated the goal of what is now called lean manufacturing as a countermeasure henry towne past president of the american society of mechanical engineers wrote in the foreword to frederick winslow taylors shop management  we are justly proud of the high wage rates which prevail throughout our country and jealous of any interference with them by the products of the cheaper labor of other countries to maintain this condition to strengthen our control of home markets and above all to broaden our opportunities in foreign markets where we must compete with the products of other industrial nations we should welcome and encourage every influence tending to increase the efficiency of our productive processescitation needed henry fordedit henry ford henry ford initially ignored the impact of waste accumulation while developing his mass assembly manufacturing system charles buxton going wrote in  fords success has startled the country almost the world financially industrially mechanically it exhibits in higher degree than most persons would have thought possible the seemingly contradictory requirements of true efficiency which are constant increase of quality great increase of pay to the workers repeated reduction in cost to the consumer and with these appears as at once cause and effect an absolutely incredible enlargement of output reaching something like one hundredfold in less than ten years and an enormous profit to the manufacturer ford in my life and work  provided a singleparagraph description that encompasses the entire concept of waste i believe that the average farmer puts to a really useful purpose only about  of the energy he expends not only is everything done by hand but seldom is a thought given to a logical arrangement a farmer doing his chores will walk up and down a rickety ladder a dozen times he will carry water for years instead of putting in a few lengths of pipe his whole idea when there is extra work to do is to hire extra men he thinks of putting money into improvements as an expense it is waste motion— waste effort— that makes farm prices high and profits low poor arrangement of the workplace—a major focus of the modern kaizen—and doing a job inefficiently out of habit—are major forms of waste even in modern workplaces ford also pointed out how easy it was to overlook material waste a former employee harry bennett wrote one day when mr ford and i were together he spotted some rust in the slag that ballasted the right of way of the d t  i railroad this slag had been dumped there from our own furnaces you know mr ford said to me theres iron in that slag you make the crane crews who put it out there sort it over and take it back to the plant in other words ford saw the rust and realized that the steel plant was not recovering all of the iron fords early success however was not sustainable as james p womack and daniel jones pointed out in lean thinking what ford accomplished represented the special case rather than a robust lean solutionpage needed the major challenge that ford faced was that his methods were built for a steadystate environment rather than for the dynamic conditions firms increasingly face today although his rigid topdown controls made it possible to hold variation in work activities down to very low levels his approach did not respond well to uncertain dynamic business conditions they responded particularly badly to the need for new product innovation this was made clear by fords precipitous decline when the company was forced to finally introduce a followon to the model t design for manufacture dfm is a concept derived from ford which emphasizes the importance of standardizing individual parts as well as eliminating redundant components in my life and workcitation needed this standardization was central to fords concept of mass production and the manufacturing tolerances or upper and lower dimensional limits that ensured interchangeability of parts became widely applied across manufacturing decades later the renowned japanese quality guru genichi taguchi demonstrated that this goal post method of measuring was inadequate he showed that loss in capabilities did not begin only after exceeding these tolerances but increased as described by the taguchi loss function at any condition exceeding the nominal condition this became an important part of w edwards demings quality movement of the s later helping to develop improved understanding of key areas of focus such as cycle time variation in improving manufacturing quality and efficiencies in aerospace and other industries while ford is renowned for his production line it is often not recognized how much effort he put into removing the fitters work to make the production line possible until ford a cars components always had to be fitted or reshaped by a skilled engineer at the point of use so that they would connect properly by enforcing very strict specification and quality criteria on component manufacture he eliminated this work almost entirely reducing manufacturing effort by between  however fords mass production system failed to incorporate the notion of pull production and thus often suffered from overproduction toyota develops tpsedit sakichi toyoda toyotas development of ideas that later became lean may have started at the turn of the th century with sakichi toyoda in a textile factory with looms that stopped themselves when a thread broke this became the seed of autonomation and jidoka toyotas journey with justintime jit may have started back in  when it moved from textiles to produce its first car kiichiro toyoda founder of toyota motor corporation directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing he decided he must stop the repairing of poor quality by intense study of each stage of the process in  when toyota won its first truck contract with the japanese government his processes hit new problems and he developed the kaizen improvement teams levels of demand in the post war economy of japan were low and the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale therefore had little application having visited and seen supermarkets in the usa taiichi ohno recognised the scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales given the financial situation during this period overproduction had to be avoided and thus the notion of pull build to order rather than target driven push came to underpin production scheduling it was with taiichi ohno at toyota that these themes came together he built on the already existing internal schools of thought and spread their breadth and use into what has now become the toyota production system tps it is principally from the tps which was widely referred to in the s as justintime manufacturing but now including many other sources that lean production is developing norman bodek wrote the following in his foreword to a reprint of fords today and tomorrowcitation needed i was first introduced to the concepts of justintime jit and the toyota production system in  subsequently i had the opportunity to witness its actual application at toyota on one of our numerous japanese study missions there i met mr taiichi ohno the systems creator when bombarded with questions from our group on what inspired his thinking he just laughed and said he learned it all from henry fords book the scale rigor and continuous learning aspects of tps have made it a core concept of lean types of wasteedit although the elimination of waste may seem like a simple and clear subject it is noticeable that waste is often very conservatively identified this then hugely reduces the potential of such an aim the elimination of waste is the goal of lean and toyota defined three broad types of waste muda muri and mura it should be noted that for many lean implementations this list shrinks to the first waste type only with reduced corresponding benefits to illustrate the state of this thinking shigeo shingo observed that only the last turn of a bolt tightens it—the rest is just movement this ever finer clarification of waste is key to establishing distinctions between valueadding activity waste and nonvalueadding workneed quotation to verify nonvalue adding work is waste that must be done under the present work conditions one key is to measure or estimate the size of these wastes to demonstrate the effect of the changes achieved and therefore the movement toward the goal the flow or smoothness based approach aims to achieve jit by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver rationale or target and priorities for implementation using a variety of techniques the effort to achieve jit exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks by forcing smooth flow of only valueadding steps these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly muri is all the unreasonable work that management imposes on workers and machines because of poor organization such as carrying heavy weights moving things around dangerous tasks even working significantly faster than usual it is pushing a person or a machine beyond its natural limits this may simply be asking a greater level of performance from a process than it can handle without taking shortcuts and informally modifying decision criteria unreasonable work is almost always a cause of multiple variations to link these three concepts is simple in tps and thus lean firstly muri focuses on the preparation and planning of the process or what work can be avoided proactively by design next mura then focuses on how the work design is implemented and the elimination of fluctuation at the scheduling or operations level such as quality and volume muda is then discovered after the process is in place and is dealt with reactively it is seen through variation in output it is the role of management to examine the muda in the processes and eliminate the deeper causes by considering the connections to the muri and mura of the system the muda and mura inconsistencies must be fed back to the muri or planning stage for the next project a typical example of the interplay of these wastes is the corporate behaviour of making the numbers as the end of a reporting period approaches demand is raised to make plan increasing mura when the numbers are low which causes production to try to squeeze extra capacity from the process which causes routines and standards to be modified or stretched this stretch and improvisation leads to muristyle waste which leads to downtime mistakes and back flows and waiting thus the muda of waiting correction and movement the original seven mudas tim wood are transport moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing inventory all components work in process and finished product not being processed motion people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing waiting waiting for the next production step interruptions of production during shift change overproduction production ahead of demand over processing resulting from poor tool or product design creating activity defects the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects eventually an eighth muda was defined by womack et al  it was described as manufacturing goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications many others have added the waste of unused human talent to the original seven wastes for example six sigma includes the waste of skills referred to as underutilizing capabilities and delegating tasks with inadequate training other additional wastes added were for example space these wastes were not originally a part of the seven deadly wastes defined by taiichi ohno in tps but were found to be useful additions in practice in  geoffrey mika in his book kaizen event implementation manual added three more forms of waste that are now universally accepted the waste associated with working to the wrong metrics or no metrics the waste associated with not utilizing a complete worker by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of participative management and lastly the waste attributable to improper use of computers not having the proper software training on use and time spent surfing playing games or just wasting time for a complete listing of the old and new wastes see bicheno and holweg  the identification of nonvalueadding work as distinct from wasted work is critical to identifying the assumptions behind the current work process and to challenging them in due course breakthroughs in smed and other process changing techniques rely upon clear identification of where untapped opportunities may lie if the processing assumptions are challengedcitation needed lean implementation develops from tpsedit lean leadershipedit this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed june  learn how and when to remove this template message the role of the leaders within the organization is the fundamental element of sustaining the progress of lean thinking experienced kaizen members at toyota for example often bring up the concepts of senpai kohai and sensei because they strongly feel that transferring of toyota culture down and across toyota can only happen when more experienced toyota sensei continuously coach and guide the less experienced lean champions one of the dislocative effects of lean is in the area of key performance indicators kpi the kpis by which a plantfacility are judged will often be driving behaviour because the kpis themselves assume a particular approach to the work being done this can be an issue where for example a truly lean fixed repeating schedule frs and jit approach is adopted because these kpis will no longer reflect performance as the assumptions on which they are based become invalid it is a key leadership challenge to manage the impact of this kpi chaos within the organization similarly commonly used accounting systems developed to support mass production are no longer appropriate for companies pursuing lean lean accounting provides truly lean approaches to business management and financial reporting after formulating the guiding principles of its lean manufacturing approach in the toyota production system tps toyota formalized in  the basis of its lean management the key managerial values and attitudes needed to sustain continuous improvement in the long run these core management principles are articulated around the twin pillars of continuous improvement relentless elimination of waste and respect for people engagement in long term relationships based on continuous improvement and mutual trust this formalization stems from problem solving as toyota expanded beyond its home base for the past  years it hit the same problems in getting tps properly applied that other western companies have had in copying tps like any other problem it has been working on trying a series of countermeasures to solve this particular concern these countermeasures have focused on culture how people behave which is the most difficult challenge of all without the proper behavioral principles and values tps can be totally misapplied and fail to deliver results as with tps the values had originally been passed down in a masterdisciple manner from boss to subordinate without any written statement on the way just as with tps it was internally argued that formalizing the values would stifle them and lead to further misunderstanding however as toyota veterans eventually wrote down the basic principles of tps toyota set to put the toyota way into writing to educate new joiners continuous improvement breaks down into three basic principles challenge having a long term vision of the challenges one needs to face to realize ones ambition what we need to learn rather than what we want to do and then having the spirit to face that challenge to do so we have to challenge ourselves every day to see if we are achieving our goals kaizen good enough never is no process can ever be thought perfect so operations must be improved continuously striving for innovation and evolution genchi genbutsu going to the source to see the facts for oneself and make the right decisions create consensus and make sure goals are attained at the best possible speed respect for people is less known outside of toyota and essentially involves two defining principles respect taking every stakeholders problems seriously and making every effort to build mutual trust taking responsibility for other people reaching their objectives teamwork this is about developing individuals through team problemsolving the idea is to develop and engage people through their contribution to team performance shop floor teams the whole site as team and team toyota at the outset differences from tpsedit while lean is seen by many as a generalization of the toyota production system into other industries and contexts there are some acknowledged differences that seem to have developed in implementationcitation needed seeking profit is a relentless focus for toyota exemplified by the profit maximization principle price – cost  profit and the need therefore to practice systematic cost reduction through tps or otherwise to realize benefit lean implementations can tend to deemphasise this key measure and thus become fixated with the implementation of improvement concepts of flow or pull however the emergence of the value curve analysis promises to directly tie lean improvements to bottomline performance measurements tool orientation is a tendency in many programs to elevate mere tools standardized work value stream mapping visual control etc to an unhealthy status beyond their pragmatic intent the tools are just different ways to work around certain types of problems but they do not solve them for you or always highlight the underlying cause of many types of problems the tools employed at toyota are often used to expose particular problems that are then dealt with as each tools limitations or blindspots are perhaps better understood so for example value stream mapping focuses upon material and information flow problems a title built into the toyota title for this activity but is not strong on metrics man or method internally they well know the limits of the tool and understood that it was never intended as the best way to see and analyze every waste or every problem related to quality downtime personnel development cross training related issues capacity bottlenecks or anything to do with profits safety metrics or morale etc no one tool can do all of that for surfacing these issues other tools are much more widely and effectively used management technique rather than change agents has been a principle in toyota from the early s when they started emphasizing the development of the production managers and supervisors skills set in guiding natural work teams and did not rely upon stafflevel change agents to drive improvements this can manifest itself as a push implementation of lean rather than pull by the team itself this area of skills development is not that of the change agent specialist but that of the natural operations work team leader although less prestigious than the tps specialists development of work team supervisors in toyota is considered an equally if not more important topic merely because there are tens of thousands of these individuals specifically it is these manufacturing leaders that are the main focus of training efforts in toyota since they lead the daily work areas and they directly and dramatically affect quality cost productivity safety and morale of the team environment in many companies implementing lean the reverse set of priorities is true emphasis is put on developing the specialist while the supervisor skill level is expected to somehow develop over time on its own lack of understanding is one of the key reasons that a large share of lean manufacturing projects in the west fail to bring any benefit in factory physics hopp and spearman describe this as romantic jit where the belief in the methods is more important than the actual understanding and results in this aspect lean manufacturing is more of a religion than a science others have compared it to cargo cult science lean servicesedit main article lean services lean principles have been successfully applied to various sectors and services for example call center services use these principles to improve live agent call handling by combining agentassisted automation and leans waste reduction practices a company reduced handle time reduced between agent variability reduced accent barriers and attained near perfect process adherence lean principles also have applications to software development and maintenance as well as other sectors of information technology it more generally the use of lean in information technology has become known as lean itcitation needed lean methods are also applicable to the public sector but most results have been achieved using a much more restricted range of techniques than lean providespage needed the challenge in moving lean to services is the lack of widely available reference implementations to allow people to see how directly applying lean manufacturing tools and practices can work and the impact it does have this makes it more difficult to build the level of belief seen as necessary for strong implementation however some research does relate widely recognized examples of success in retail and even airlines to the underlying principles of lean despite this it remains the case that the direct manufacturing examples of techniques or tools need to be better translated into a service context to support the more prominent approaches of implementation which has not yet received the level of work or publicity that would give starting points for implementors the upshot of this is that each implementation often feels its way along as must the early industrial engineering practices of toyota this places huge importance upon sponsorship to encourage and protect these experimental developmentscitation needed lean management is nowadays implemented also in nonmanufacturing processes and administrative processes in nonmanufacturing processes is still huge potential for optimization and efficiency increase goals and strategyedit the espoused goals of lean manufacturing systems differ between various authors while some maintain an internal focus eg to increase profit for the organization others claim that improvements should be done for the sake of the customer some commonly mentioned goals arecitation needed improve quality to stay competitive in todays marketplace a company must understand its customers wants and needs and design processes to meet their expectations and requirements eliminate waste waste is any activity that consumes time resources or space but does not add any value to the product or service reduce time reducing the time it takes to finish an activity from start to finish is one of the most effective ways to eliminate waste and lower costs reduce total costs to minimize cost a company must produce only to customer demand overproduction increases a company’s inventory costs because of storage needs the strategic elements of lean can be quite complex and comprise multiple elements four different notions of lean have been identified lean as a fixed state or goal being lean

supply chain and outsource scale information technology is necessary and can deal with most of hard lean practices to synchronise pull system in supply chains and value system the manufacturing

system of stocks directly to the suppliers companiesneed quotation to verify with the improvement of global scale supply chains firms apply lean practices jit supplier partnership and customer involvement built between global firms and suppliers intensively to connect with consumers markets efficiently crisisedit after years of success of toyota’s lean production the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought toyota to the position of being the worlds biggest carmaker in the rapid expansion in  the crisis of safetyrelated problems in toyota made other carmakers that duplicated toyota’s supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them james womack had warned toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems indeed the crisis cost a great fortune and left toyota thinking whether the jit practice has problems about outsourced suppliers without enough experience and senior engineers could not achieve the monitoring job close to their suppliers out of japan that is proven as the economy of scale becomes global the softlearn practices become more important in their outsourced suppliers if they could keep good sensei relationship with their partners and constantly modify production process to perfection otherwise toyota begins to consider whether to have more choices of suppliers of producing the same component it might bring more safety on riskcontrol and reduce the huge cost that might happen in the future the appliance of jit in supply chain system is the key issue of lean implementation in global scale how do the supply partners avoid causing production flow global firms should make more suppliers who can compete with each other in order to get the best quality and lower the risk of production flow at the same timecitation needed steps to achieve lean systemsedit the following steps should be implemented to create the ideal lean manufacturing system design a simple manufacturing system recognize that there is always room for improvement continuously improve the lean manufacturing system design design a simple manufacturing systemedit a fundamental principle of lean manufacturing is demandbased flow manufacturing in this type of production setting inventory is only pulled through each production center when it is needed to meet a customers order the benefits of this goal include decreased cycle time less inventory increased productivity increased capital equipment utilization continuous improvementedit a continuous improvement mindset is essential to reach the companys goals the term continuous improvement means incremental improvement of products processes or services over time with the goal of reducing waste to improve workplace functionality customer service or product performance lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities the value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for everything else is waste and should be eliminated simplified reduced or integrated rizzardo full citation needed improving the flow of material through new ideal system layouts at the customers required rate would reduce waste in material movement and inventoryneed quotation to verify measureedit overall equipment effectiveness oee is a set of performance metrics that fit well in a lean environment also pmts methodstime measurement cost analysis and perhaps time study can be used to evaluate the wastes and it effectiveness in the operational processes for example juning ker and yichuan wang analyze two prescribing technologies namely no carbon required ncr and digital scanning technologies to quantify the advantages of the medication ordering transcribing and dispensing process in a multihospital health system with comparison between these two technologiesthe statistical analysis results show a significant reduction on process times by adopting digital scanning technology the results indicated a reduction of  in queue time  in order entry time  in outgoing delay time and  in outgoing transit time with the use of digital scanning technology implementation dilemmaedit one criticism of lean is that its practitioners may focus on tools and methodologies rather than on the philosophy and culture of lean consequently adequate management is needed in order to avoid failed implementation of lean methodologies another pitfall is that management decides what solution to use without understanding the true problem and without consulting shop floor personnel as a result lean implementations often look good to the manager but fail to improve the situation in addition many of the popular lean initiatives coming from the tps are solutions to specific problems that toyota was facing toyota having an undesired current condition determined what the end state would look like through much study the gap was closed which resulted in many of the tools in place today often when a tool is implemented outside of tps a company believes that the solution lay specifically within one of the popular lean initiatives the tools which were the solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not be able to be applied in exactly the same manner as designed thus the solution does not fit the problem and a temporary solution is created vs the actual root cause the lean philosophy aims to reduce costs while optimizing and improving performance value stream mapping vsm and s are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps towards making their organisation leaner lean actions can be focused on the specific logistics processes or cover the entire supply chain for example you might start from analysis of skus using several days to identify and draw each skus path evaluating all the participants from material suppliers to the consumer conducting a gap analysis determines the companys must take steps to improve the value stream and achieve the objective based on that evaluation the improvement group conducts the failure mode effects analysis fmea in order to identify and prevent risk factors it is crucial for frontline workers to be involved in vsm activities since they understood the process and can directly increase the efficiency although the impact may be small and limited for each lean activity implementing a series small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity after adopting the lean approach both managers and employees experience change therefore decisive leaders are needed when starting on a lean journey there are several requirements to control the lean journey first and most importantly experts recommend that the organization have its own lean plan developed by the lean leadership in other words the lean team provides suggestions for the leader who then makes the actual decisions about what to implement second coaching is recommended when the organization starts off on its lean journey they will impart their knowledge and skills to shopfloor staff and the lean implementation will be much more efficient third the metrics or measurements used for measuring lean and improvements are extremely important it will enable collection of the data required for informed decisionmaking by a leader one cannot successfully implement lean without sufficient aptitude at measuring the process and outputs to control and improve results going forward one must see and measure ie map what is happening now lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises one distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting for standard cost accounting skus are difficult to grasp skus include too much hypothesis and variance ie skus hold too much indeterminacy manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting in using lean accounting one expected gain is activitybased cost visibility ie measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and suppliescitation needed see alsoedit a problem solving
