efforts outside of north america  in  it opened a london office and since  the firm and its portfolio companies have acquired or invested in over eight technology companies in europe  accelkkr has also expanded its investor base outside the united states such that in fund v over one third of the committed capital is from international investors  international investments continue to be an
