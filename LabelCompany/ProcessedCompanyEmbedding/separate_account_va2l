what is a managed separate account  nasdaqcom hot topics etfs  smart portfolio  currencies  online broker center search what is a managed separate account july    am edt by mike rowan erollover shutterstock photo managed separate accounts a managed separate account is a type of investment similar to a mutual fund  that is under the management of a professional investment firm a portfolio manager is responsible for all of the investment decisions and rely on various analysts to assist them in making strategic investment decisions managed separate accounts are different than mutual funds due to the fact that each investment portfolio is unique to you personal account for example if you had a separate account the money manager has complete discretion to make decisions that may differ from decisions made for other related accounts managed separate accounts vs mutual funds in this example lets say that the portfolio manager invests your money in an equity strategy where your portfolio is made up of  individual stocks concurrently they launch an identical mutual fund strategy made up of these exact stock holdings in the beginning both portfolios with the same percentage of ownership in the securities  from your point of view while the holdings in either fund are identical in the beginning the statements will look different for the mutual fund client their holding will show on their statement as a single holding and does not break down the individual holdings within the account the mutual funds net asset value will be calculated at the end of each day and a value will be assigned the managed separate account  however will have a listing of the individual stock positions and values separately and the value of the account will be treated on an individual basis throughout the day as the stocks in your portfolio rise and fall as time goes on the mutual fund and separate account portfolios evolve in a different way the decisions that the mutual fund portfolio manager makes will affect all of the mutual fund holders in the exact same way on the other hand the separate account decisions are actually made for each individual holder and will vary from account holder to account holder individual portfolio customization when it comes to individual taxable accounts especially managed separate account holders have a unique advantage mutual funds act as a single bucket with no regard to the individual situations of each investor however with managed accounts investors are treated differently dependent on their individual situation and they have the ability to do things that you cannot do in a mutual fund like harvesting losses at the end of the year avoiding particular industries and avoiding many of the operating expenses that are built into mutual funds account minimums to participate in a separate account as previously mentioned managed separate accounts have an advantage over mutual funds in that you are not lumped into a pool of investors that are sharing expenses however these accounts are not available to any investor like mutual funds as you do have to have a minimum amount of money in order to have access to these types of accounts as a general rule of thumb you have to have at least  to invest in order to participate in a separate account fee structure differences between mutual funds and separate managed accounts mutual fund fees are simple and relatively uncomplicated their charge is known as a net expense ratio that includes the management fee trading costs and a charge called a b fee for most types of funds many funds also have different types of sales charges and the differences can be found by reading this article about the different types of mutual fund sales expenses  managed separate accounts are much more cut and dry when it comes to expenses usually the fund manager and your advisor agree on a fee that is charged as a percentage of your assets under management most separate account fees range between  and are charged on a quarterly basis there are no other built in fees so separate accounts usually provide more of a value since they are a bit cheaper than most mutual funds the views

separately from the insurers general assets separate accounts were originally established in response to federal securities laws for investmentlinked variable annuities although it took many years the application of separate accounts has dramatically expanded beyond this simple product design product development has resulted with an array of “hybrid” products—products that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees eg mortality morbidity etc being allocated to the separate account investment portfolio the use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly over the past  years in response to recommendations to clarify information pertaining to separate account products and related separate account assets detailed information is available in the statutory financial statements distinct filings for separate products that are “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general account creditors when completing the insulated separate account filing the reporting entity

features such as different death benefits or annuity payments and different charges these differences are noted in appendix c an annuity is a contract between you the owner and an insurance company in this case transamerica where the insurance company promises to pay you an income in the form of annuity payments these payments begin on a designated date referred to as the annuity date until the annuity date your annuity is in the accumulation phase and the earnings if any are tax deferred tax deferral means you generally are not taxed until you take money out of your annuity after the annuity date your annuity switches to the income phase the contract is a flexible premium variable annuity you can use the contract to accumulate funds for retirement or other longterm financial planning purposes your individual investment and your rights are determined primarily by your own contract the contract is a flexible premium contract because after you purchase it you can generally make additional investments of any amount of  or more until the annuity date but you are not required to make any additional investments the contract is a variable annuity because the value of your investments can go up or down based on the performance of your investment choices if you invest in the variable account the amount of money you are able to accumulate in your contract during the accumulation phase depends upon the performance of your investment choices you could lose the amount you allocate to the variable portion the amount of annuity payments you receive during the income

regarding taxes in the sai annuity contracts in general deferred annuity contracts are a way of setting aside money for future needs like retirement congress recognized how important saving for retirement is and provided special rules in the internal revenue code for annuities simply stated these rules generally provide that generally you will not be taxed on the earnings if any on the money held in your annuity contract until you take the money out this is referred to as tax deferral there are different rules as to how you will be taxed depending on how you take the money out and the type of contractqualified or nonqualified discussed below you will generally not be taxed on increases in the value of your contract until a distribution occurseither as a surrender or as annuity payments and tax deferral will not apply when a nonnatural person eg corporation or certain other entities other than taxqualified trusts owns a nonqualified contract the contract will generally not be treated as an annuity for tax purposes qualified and nonqualified contracts if you purchase the contract under an individual retirement annuity a pension plan or specially sponsored program your contract is referred to as a qualified contract qualified contracts are issued in connection with the following plans  individual retirement annuity ira a traditional ira allows individuals to make contributions which may be deductible to the contract a roth ira also allows individuals to make contributions to the contract but it does not allow a deduction for contributions and distributions may be taxfree if the owner meets certain rules  taxsheltered annuity b plan a b plan may be made available to employees of certain public school systems and taxexempt organizations and permits contributions to the contract on a pretax basis  corporate pension and profitsharing and hr  plan employers and self employed individuals can establish pension or profitsharing plans for their employees or themselves and make contributions to the contract on a pretax basis  deferred compensation plan  plan certain governmental and taxexempt organizations can establish a plan to defer compensation on behalf of their employees through contributions to the contract the contract contains death benefit features that in some cases may exceed the greater of the purchase payments or the account value the death benefit could be characterized as an incidental benefit the amount of which is limited in any pension or profitsharing plan or b plan because the death benefit may exceed this limitation anyone using the contract in connection with such plans should consult their tax adviser the internal revenue service has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an ira and has not addressed in a ruling of general applicability whether the death benefit provision such as the provisions in the contract comports with ira qualification requirements if you purchase the contract as an individual and not under an individual retirement annuity b plan  plan or pension or profit sharing plan your contract is referred to as a nonqualified contract surrendersqualified contracts the information herein describing the taxation of nonqualified contracts does not apply to qualified contracts there are special rules that govern with respect to qualified contracts generally these rules restrict  the amount that can be contributed to the contract during any year  the time when amounts can be paid from the contract and  the amount of any death benefit that may be allowed in addition a

in the internal revenue code or  declares hardship however in the case of hardship the owner can only surrender the purchase payments and not any earnings diversification and distribution requirements the internal revenue code provides that the underlying investments for a variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification requirements in order to be treated as an annuity the contract must also meet certain distribution requirements at the death of an owner in order to be treated as an annuity these diversification and distribution requirements are discussed in the sai transamerica may modify the contract to attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment surrendersnonqualified contracts if you make a surrender including systematic payouts from a nonqualified contract before the annuity date the internal revenue code treats that surrender as first coming from earnings and then from your purchase payments when you make a surrender you are taxed on the amount of the surrender that is earnings the excess interest adjustment resulting from the surrender may affect the amount on which you are taxed but the tax treatment of excess interest adjustments is uncertain you should consult a tax advisor if a surrender results in an excess interest adjustment if you make a full surrender you are generally taxed on the amount that your surrender proceeds exceeds the investment in the contract which is generally your purchase payments paid adjusted for any prior surrenders or portions thereof that were not taxable different rules apply for annuity payments see annuity payments

contemplating any such transfer assignment selection or change should contact a competent tax adviser with respect to the potential tax effects of such a transaction possible tax law changes although the likelihood of legislative changes is uncertain there is always the possibility that the tax treatment of the contract could change by legislation or otherwise you should consult a tax adviser with respect to legal developments and their effect on the contract variable account charges it is possible that the internal revenue service may take a position that fees for certain optional benefits eg death benefits other than the return of premium death benefit are deemed to be taxable distributions to you in particular the internal revenue service may treat fees associated with the tax relief rider as a taxable surrender which might also be subject to a tax penalty if the surrender occurs prior to age   although we do not believe that the fees associated with the tax relief rider or any

period certain and  the annuitants dies before the due date of the second third fourth etc annuity payment then  we will make only one two three etc annuity payments the minimum annuitization value is used solely to calculate the guaranteed minimum income benefit annuity payments and does not establish or guarantee a account value or guarantee performance of any investment option because this benefit is based on conservative actuarial factors such as the use of a  assumed investment return to calculate the first annuity payment which results in a lower dollar amount for that payment than would result from using the  assumed investment return that is used with the regular annuity payments described in section  above the level of lifetime income that it guarantees may be less than the level that would be provided by application of the adjusted account value at otherwise applicable annuity factors therefore the guaranteed minimum income benefit should be regarded as a safety net the costs of annuitizing under the guaranteed minimum income benefit include the guaranteed payment fee and also the lower payout levels inherent in the annuity tables used for those minimum payouts which may include an annuity age factor adjustment these costs should be balanced against the benefits of a minimum payout level moreover the initial payment guarantee option described below also provides for a minimum payout level and it uses actuarial factors such as a  assumed investment return that provide for higher payment levels for a given account value than the guaranteed minimum income benefit which uses a  assumed investment return to calculate the first annuity payment and a  rate to calculate all subsequent payments you should carefully consider these factors since electing annuity payments under the guaranteed minimum income benefit will generally be advantageous only when the minimum annuitization value is sufficiently in excess of the adjusted account value to overcome these disadvantages in addition to the annual growth rate other benefits and fees under the rider the rider fee the fee waiver threshold the guaranteed payment fee and the waiting period

credited to the contract then remains fixed assuming no transfers to or from that subaccount occur the dollar value of variable annuity units in the chosen subaccount will increase or decrease

proposed and final treasury regulations thereunder judicial authority and current  paposnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd administrative rulings and practice this summary discusses only certain federal income tax consequences to united states persons and does not discuss state local or foreign tax consequences united states persons means citizens or residents of the united states domestic corporations domestic partnerships and trusts or estates that are subject to united states federal income tax regardless of the source of their income tax status of the policy the following discussion is based on the assumption that the contract qualifies as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes distribution requirements the code requires that nonqualified contracts  contain specific provisions for distribution of contract proceeds upon the death of any owner in order to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes the code requires that such contracts provide that if any owner dies on or after the annuity date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed the remaining portion must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method in effect on such owners death if any owner dies before the annuity date the entire interest in the contract must generally be distributed within  years after such owners date of death or be used to purchase an immediate annuity under which payments will begin within one year of such owners death and will be made for the life of the beneficiary or for a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary as defined in section s of the code however if upon such owners death prior to the annuity date such owners surviving spouse becomes the sole new owner under the contract then the contract may be continued with the surviving spouse as the new owner under the contract the beneficiary is the designated beneficiary of an ownerannuitant and the successor owner is the designated beneficiary of an owner who is not the annuitant if any owner is not a natural person then for purposes of these distribution requirements the primary annuitant shall be treated as an owner and any death or change of such primary annuitant shall be treated as the death of an owner the nonqualified contracts contain provisions intended to comply with these requirements of the code no regulations interpreting these requirements of the code have yet been issued and thus no assurance can be given that the provisions contained in the contracts satisfy all such code requirements the provisions contained in the contracts will be reviewed and modified if necessary to assure that they comply with the code requirements when clarified by regulation or otherwise diversification requirements section h of the code provides that in order  for a variable contract which is based on a segregated asset account to qualify as an annuity contract under the code the investments made by such account must be adequately diversified in accordance with treasury regulations the treasury regulations issued under section h treas reg s apply a diversification requirement to each of the subaccounts the variable account through its underlying funds and their portfolios intends to comply with the diversification requirements of the treasury transamerica has entered into agreements with each underlying fund company which requires the portfolios to be operated in compliance with the treasury regulations owner control in certain circumstances owners of variable annuity contracts  may be considered the owners for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the variable account used to support their contracts in those circumstances income and gains from the variable account assets would be includable in the variable annuity contract owners gross income several years ago the irs stated in published rulings that a variable annuity contract owner will be considered the owner of variable account assets if the contract owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets more recently the treasury department announced in connection with the issuance of regulations concerning investment diversification that those regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor ie you rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account this announcement also stated that guidance would be issued by way of regulations or rulings on the extent to which contractholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as owners of the underlying assets the ownership rights under the contract are similar to but different in certain respects from those described by the irs in rulings in which it was determined that contract owners were not owners of variable account assets for example you have the choice of more subaccounts in which to allocate premiums and account values and may be able to transfer among these accounts more frequently than in such rulings these differences could result in you  paposrd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust rd being treated as the owner of the assets of the variable account in addition transamerica does not know what standards will be set forth if any in the regulations or rulings that the treasury department has stated it expects to issue transamerica therefore reserves the right to modify the contracts as necessary to attempt to prevent you from being considered the owner of a pro rata share of the assets of the variable account withholding the portion of any distribution under a contract that is  includable in gross income will be subject to federal income tax withholding unless the recipient of such distribution elects not to have federal income tax withheld election forms will be provided at the time distributions are requested or made the withholding rate varies according to the type of distribution and the owners tax status for qualified contracts eligible rollover distributions from section a plans section a annuities and section b taxsheltered annuities are subject to a mandatory federal income tax withholding of  an eligible rollover distribution is the taxable portion of any distribution from such a plan except certain distributions such as distributions required by the code distributions in a specified annuity form or hardship distributions the  withholding does not apply however if the owner chooses a direct rollover from the plan to another taxqualified plan or ira different withholding requirements may apply in the case of nonunited states persons qualified contracts the qualified contract is designed for use with several  types of taxqualified retirement plans the tax rules applicable to participants and beneficiaries in taxqualified retirement plans vary according to the type of plan and the terms and conditions of the plan special favorable tax treatment may be available for certain types of contributions and distributions adverse tax consequences may result from contributions in excess of specified limits distributions prior to age   subject to certain exceptions distributions that do not conform to specified commencement and minimum distribution rules and in other specified circumstances some retirement plans are subject to distribution and other requirements that are not incorporated into the contracts or our contract administration procedures owners participants and beneficiaries are responsible for determining that contributions distributions and other transactions with respect to the contracts comply with applicable law for qualified plans under section a a b and  the code requires that distributions generally must commence no later than the later of april  of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the owner or plan participant i reaches age   or ii retires and must be made in a specified form or manner if the plan participant is a  percent owner as defined in the code distributions generally must begin no later than april  of the calendar year in which the owner or plan participant reaches age   each owner is responsible for requesting distributions under the contract that satisfy applicable tax rules transamerica makes no attempt to provide more than general information about use of the contract with the various types of retirement plans purchasers of contracts for use with any retirement plan should consult their legal counsel and tax adviser regarding the suitability of the contract individual retirement annuities in order to qualify as a traditional  individual retirement annuity under section b of the code a contract must contain certain provisions i the owner must be

permissible death benefit but it is unclear to what extent such an enhanced death benefit could disqualify the contract as an ira the internal revenue service has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an ira and has not addressed in a ruling of general applicability whether an enhanced death benefit provision such as the provision in the contract comports with ira qualification requirements roth individual retirement annuities roth ira the roth ira under section  a of the code contains many of the same provisions as a traditional ira however there are some differences first the contributions are not deductible and must be made in cash or as a rollover or transfer from another roth ira or other ira a rollover from or conversion of an ira to a roth ira may be subject to

investing financial planning and other investments  stable value « stable value what are general accounts and separate accounts guaranteed insurance accounts can be structured in two ways general accounts or separate accounts in the general account structure the assets are invested in and owned by the insurance company’s general account which means the entire general account of the insurance company and effectively the ultimate claims paying ability of the insurer supports the stable value guarantees the assets in a general account are not attributable to any single policyholder or liability and the employee retirement income security act erisa excludes the assets supporting these guaranteed insurance accounts from the definition of plan assets and treatment as plan assets separate accounts differ from general accounts in that the assets are segregated from the general account of the insurer this separate account serves as the first line of collateral to meet the guarantees for the specific plan and only if the separate account assets are insufficient would the general account step in to make up any potential shortage   apart from the structural differences both the general account and separate account are remarkably similar in how each delivers stable value’s benefit responsiveness which is the ability of plan participants to transact at contract value ie at principal plus accumulated interest because there are different types of stable value investments and differences in how they are structured there are also differences in their disclosure requirements stable value investments such as synthetic gics and separate account wraps are very similar to other fee based k investments in terms of disclosure because the rates of return for these products are tied directly and contractually to the performance of the underlying portfolio these products have crediting rates which are reset using contractual formulas to pass through the investment performance of the underlying assets of the portfolio and as such they are required to provide detailed listings of the underlying portfolio holdings to plan sponsors as well as meet the department of labor’s fee disclosure requirements guaranteed insurance accounts on the other hand differ because they declare and guarantee a rate for up to a year or longer in advance and also provide a minimum guaranteed rate of return regardless of the performance of the assets which are held in the insurer’s general account the rate is not tied directly to the investment performance of a specific underlying portfolio but based on the entire general account of the insurer and because assets in the general account support guarantees made to all policyholders under multiple lines of business they are not attributable or dedicated to any specific contract for interested parties general account investment holdings are available through annual filings with the state insurance department   notes erisa advisory opinion a us department of labor      why are guaranteed insurance accounts treated differently in dol fee disclosure requirements guaranteed insurance accounts are fully compliant with the disclosure requirements under b how does an insurer take on these risks transferring risk from policyholders to the insurance company is at the very heart of what insurance
