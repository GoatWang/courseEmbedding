groups within a society had a strong impact on human behavior in this lesson we will discuss primary groups the theory of the lookingglass self and the concept that ones self and society are distinctly one unit not two why cooley studied groups and social behaviorcharles horton cooley was a sociologist who wanted to better understand why human beings behave the way they do one of cooleys most important contributions to sociology was his idea that by studying everyday social interactions between people one could begin to better understand why people behave as they do this is the basis of the interactionist perspective of sociology cooley stated that to understand behavior we must first understand the meanings humans attach to certain situations and thus the behavior that is taught to go along with that situation he believed that societies shape the lives of the people who live within them cooley focused much of his work on primary groups cooleys major contribution to sociology was the study of primary groups cooley coined the term primary group meaning that this is the first group one is introduced to and is the most influential on our learning of ideas beliefs and ideals when observing society cooley noticed that the more a society became industrialized the more individualistic the members became he saw that the people became more distant from each other more competitive and were losing the connection to traditional family values and that of community it was through his study of primary groups that cooley hoped to instill more social unity and cohesiveness while society has continued to evolve and change even at a more rapid pace many of the social problems cooley was concerned with still exist today however with cooleys research we better understand the importance of social unity and societys influence upon individuals cooleys careerborn in  in ann arbor michigan as a son of a michigan supreme court judge charles horton cooley grew up in a household where education was highly valued and with high expectations placed upon him by his ambitious father in  cooley earned his phd from the university of michigan in  he founded the american sociological association and in  became a full professor of sociology at the university of michigan he remained teaching at the university for his entire career primary groupslike many sociologists cooley wanted to understand society better as mentioned earlier cooley found that the more advanced a society became the more individualistic people became he witnessed the breakdown of social cohesion and traditional family he was convinced that it was the small intimate groups which influenced behavior the most and with a breakdown of these primary groups we also had a breakdown of human behavior families are examples of primary groups cooley coined the term primary groups which is defined as groups characterized by intimate facetoface association and cooperation primary groups come together for expressive reasons  to provide emotional support love companionship and security it is through these groups that one begins to develop the sense of self the looking glass selfcooley is one of the founders of the interactionist perspective which seeks to explain society by looking at the everyday forms of interaction between individuals cooleys theory of self is one in which we learn who we are through our interactions with others this is known as the looking glass self this basically means that our selfimage comes from our own selfreflection and from what others think of us cooley believed that it is through these interactions that one begins to develop an idea of who they are therefore the self is a product of our social interactions there are three phases to the development of self according to the looking glass self theory we imagine how we present ourselves to others we imagine how others evaluate us we develop some sort of feeling about ourselves based upon our perception of what we think others have of us the self then emerges from ones individual imagination of what we think others think of us one critical element to this is that we may perceive someones impression of us incorrectly for example a parent criticizes something their child does the child then feels that the parent thinks they are stupid and thus the child then begins to believe i am stupid using the social mirror as a measurement of ourselves a positive reaction from someone creates a positive selfconcept a negative reaction a negative selfconcept cooley states that this is a neverending process for we are always meeting new people and reevaluating ourselves based upon our impression of what they think of us × unlock content over  lessons in all major subjects get free

psychology ap cooleys view of self and societycooleys sociology is decidedly holistic he speaks of society as being an organism he states this by emphasizing the systematic interrelations between all parts of society and social processes to quote cooley if…we say that society is an organism we mean    that it is a complex of forms of processes each of which is living and growing by interaction with the others the whole being so unified that what takes place in one part affects all the rest it is a vast tissue of reciprocal activity cooley therefore believed that self and society could be equated as the same entity he once said self and society are twinborn he believed that one could not exist let alone develop and thrive without the other cooley stated that an individual could not develop a sense of who they are without something to compare it to thus states cooley individuals in the same group and society are dependent upon one another for the development of their selfidentity cooley argued that a persons self grows out of a persons commerce with others cooley stated the social origin of his life comes by the pathway of intercourse with other persons the self to cooley is not first individual and then social it arises side by side through communication ones consciousness of himself is a reflection of the ideas about himself that he attributes to other minds thus there can be no isolated selves cooley stated there is no sense of i without its correlative sense of you or he or they lesson summarycooley is known in sociology for his contribution to the development of the interactionist perspective and for his development of the looking glass self he was one of the first to define the importance of society in forming the individual or self and the importance of primary groups his organic link between society and self remains one of cooleys crucial contributions to the area of modernday psychology and sociology learning outcomesafter completing the lesson you

nothing less to our credit than our neglect of the foreigner and his children unless it be the arrogance most of us betray when we set out to americanize him –charles horton cooley charles horton cooley was born on august   in ann arbor michigan the fourth of six children he was the son of mary elizabeth horton and the renowned law school professor and state supreme court justice thomas mcintyre cooley young cooley was somewhat of a withdrawn passive child he felt intimidated and alienated by his successful father a characteristic that haunted him for the rest of his life cooley attended the public schools of ann arbor and graduated high school in  cooley attended college at the university of michiganann arbor where his father once taught after seven years interrupted by bouts of illness some apparently psychosomatic he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering after a period of travel to europe cooley began work as a draftsman and statistician while in school he took several courses in history philosophy and economics these subjects peaked cooley’s interest and he began independent readings of darwin spencer and the german sociologist albert schaeffle cooley returned to the university of michigan in  for graduate work in political economy and sociology because there was yet no formal instruction in sociology at the university of michigan he was forwarded test questions by franklin giddings cooley’s dissertation “the theory of transportation” was most notable for its conclusion that towns and cities tend to be situated at the convergence of transportation routes cooley received his phd in philosophy in  soon thereafter cooley moved to washington dc to work for the interstate commerce commission and later the bureau of the census he read his dissertation paper as well as a second work “social significance of street railways” at a meeting of the american economic association in  cooley married elsie jones daughter of first dean of the homeopathic medical college at the university of michigan in  she was very outgoing and energetic and effectively balanced out cooley’s shy retiring side they lived in ann arbor within close proximity to the university and had three children a boy and two girls cooley was said to have enjoyed long walks with companions camping trips to canada and cooking picnic suppers for his wife he built a cabin at crystal lake in northern michigan where he and his family went swimming and boating cooley was also fond of amateur botany and bird watching in  cooley accepted an appointment as an instructor of political economy at the university of michigan he soon became an assistant professor of sociology and taught the university’s first sociology course in  cooley swiftly progressed to associate professor status in  and became a full professor  he was noted to have been invited to positions in other institutions around the country on one occasion called to columbia by giddings but he never wanted to leave ann arbor where his father and wife’s father both taught cooley was fortunate to have had no financial worries in his life he lived through an age in which the “publish or perish” philosophy had not yet developed and he was able to enjoy a life of leisurely reflection and study cooley spent a great deal of time speculating and contemplating the subject of the self he observed the development of his own children which he used to construct his theories cooley was greatly inspired by the writings of johann wolfgang von goethe henry david thoreau ralph waldo emerson and charles darwin in his own works cooley sought to highlight the connection between society and the individual and felt that the two could only be understood in relationship to each other one’s personality comes from one’s influences he coined the concept of the “lookingglass self” the social determination of the self which later influenced george herbert mead’s theory of self and symbolic interactionism cooley ultimately wanted to show that the facts of social life are mental and the conduct of persons groups and institutions are the result of fundamental mental phenomena cooley produced his next work “personal competition”  in which he noted an alarming trend as the united states was expanding and becoming more industrialized people seemed to become more individualistic and competitive exhibiting less concern for traditional family and neighborhood cooley asserted that primary groups a term he described as the foundation of one’s morals sentiments and ideals are ethically good because they provoke a sense of safety belonging fairness and consideration he hoped that by calling attention to the significance of primary groups individuals might revive traditional values and maintain social cohesion in human nature and the social order  cooley foreshadowed mead’s discussion of the symbolism of the self delving into the effects of social responses and social participation in social organization  cooley expanded his ideas further accentuating the importance of primary groups he believed that the impact of one’s primary group was so great that one would cling to primary ideals in more complex associations and even generate new primary groupings within formal organizations in  cooley wrote social process this work emphasized the nonrational provisional nature of social organization and the impact of social competition cooley declared that present troubles were caused by the conflict between primary group values and institutional values he also produced life and the student  a collection of writings accumulated throughout his life and sociological theory and social research  pieces on social ecology cooley participated in the founding of the american sociological society in  as a member he presented a paper at a  meeting social consciousness and in  social control in international relations he served as its eighth president in  his presidential address delivered at the  annual meeting was entitled a primary culture for democracy cooley later published various articles in the society’s journals including “reflections upon the sociology of herbert spencer” american journal of sociology    and now and then originally read at a dinner of the  annual meeting journal of applied sociology    in  cooley’s health began to fail and in march of  he was diagnosed with cancer he died on may   our individual lives cannot generally be works of art unless the social order is also –charles horton cooley for
