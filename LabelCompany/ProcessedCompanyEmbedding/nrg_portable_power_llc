example ravpower claims that one battery cycle of its power bank model can charge an iphone  times over intocircuit claims that its portable power bank can recharge an iphone four or five times what is a portable charger at this point you may be wondering what a portable charger is how it works and why you might want one a portable charger is an accessory that quickly charges your devices without being plugged into a wall you fill it up with power which you can then use anywhere to charge your device there are portable chargers that use your car’s battery and solar power but this guide focuses primarily on the kind you charge in an outlet overnight and then take with you to power a mobile device people buy portable chargers for a number of reasons you may appreciate having one if you are constantly on the go and need a backup to help you stay connected often drain your devices due to frequent use are at an event like a convention and need to charge throughout are planning an overnight camping trip like to have a backup power source in case of an emergency expert tip if you spend a lot of time outdoors a product with a flashlight like the introcircuit could be perfect for you esther   technology product review researcher what can it charge the vast majority of chargers are designed for smartphone and tablet charging however some portable chargers are equipped to charge laptops as well before buying a portable charger ask yourself what it is you need it to do otherwise you may end up buying a charger that doesn’t suit your needs… or one that sits in a drawer most of the time for example a person who needs a charger for an overnight camping trip would probably do better with the introcircuit on our shortlist — which can charge two devices at once and includes an led flashlight — than the miniature anker the ravpower in our product matrix can be used to charge a laptop while this is a much longer process it works the same way as charging a phone or tablet — with the slight adjustment of having an extra device connected to one of your ports size and aesthetics with the exception of the anker which is about the size of a lipstick tube the average charger looks like a small brick dimensions vary between brands but most conform to a ”x” size with a thickness of ½” to ¾” they’re designed to easily fit in a pocket or suitcase bulk is generally not an issue with a portable charger each charger has its own aesthetic appeal which you can judge for yourself some are shiny and metallic some are plastic some have a rubber housing the ravpower and intocircuit models exude a sleek metallic finish the yellow and gray mycharge amp is shelled in a rubber casing that helps protect it against wear and tear the lenmar helix and anker have plastic casings the lenmar differs from many others on the market in that it is small and cylindrical like a lipstick tube in general it takes less time to charge a device with a portable charger than it does with a standard plug accessory weight while most chargers may look about the same they definitely don’t share the same weight as different chargers use different components the lightest of the bunch is the rubberencased mycharge weighing in at a surprising  ounces the plastic anker weighs more although it is still fairly light at  ounces the heaviest of the bunch is the ounce ravpower this one weighs more because it carries some extra tech as you’ll read below did you know you can have the charger plugged in while it’s recharging something ie charge both devices — charger and phonetablet — together just keep an eye on any overheating charging times charging times charging your charger’s battery every portable charger has a battery that must be charged if you don’t charge your charger’s battery it’s of little use to you because every battery is designed differently they all require a different amount of time to reach  all of the models on our shortlist require a period of about six hours to get from empty to full except the anker which only needs about four hours charging times charging your device regardless of which product you buy a portable charger will juice up your smartphone or tablet much faster than a standard usb cord plugged into an outlet or computer why do portable chargers work so fast simply put a charger’s goal is to send as much power as possible to whatever device it’s connected to as a result you end up getting about twice the amount of power from a portable charger as you would from an outlet this is a smart and effective way to cut down on charging times for phones and tablets that seem to take forever to refill would you like your phone fully charged in a matter of  minutes or so yes please one of the benefits of portable chargers is that you can mix and match tech with multiple companies and brands without suffering compatibility issues for example you could plug a samsung phone and an lg tablet into the same charger at the same time — as long as it has two ports usb ports the average heavyduty charger includes at least two usb ports so you can charge two devices at the same time for example the ravpower intocircuit and mycharge all boast a standard twoport design for those who need to charge multiple items at once the lenmar comes with three usb ports the only device on our list with a single port is the anker but in exchange for that it has a slim “pocket” design that’s great for people on the move the affordable anker comes in five cool colors black blue pink silver and gold accessories portable chargers aren’t usually big on accessories only one of the five chargers in our matrix includes an accessory you may find useful the introcircuit comes with a builtin led flashlight with a range up to  feet if you’re a camper this could prove to be handy some other brands also include this accessory with varying degrees of light range and brightness but if you’re considering a portable charger with a flashlight bear in mind that the flashlight draws from the same power as your device the longer you use the flashlight the less reserve power you have expert tip things charge at different speeds so if charging two devices expect one to finish quicker rafe   technologist product review professional lifespan will your portable charger last forever in a word no while chargers do an incredible job of keeping your personal tech at full battery keep in mind that you’re essentially buying a large battery when you buy a portable charger and all batteries have an expiration date the difference between a portable charger and a standard battery is that the battery’s “lifespan”  and subsequent expiration is more or less set in stone based on size and usage a charger’s lifespan has no set time and date used moderately a charger could last you two to five years used daily it’s more likely to last one or two years the ravpower is one of the pricier portable chargers on our list but according to the manufacturer it will provide  charges over the course of its battery life price now is a great time to snag a portable charger as prices have reduced significantly a year or two ago you’d be paying  for one the best models today you can buy a highend model like the ravpower for about  on a budget the anker sits under  this one could be the best bet for your cash if you’re a person who attends a lot of conventions or takes frequent work trips it’s a simple inexpensive device that can go with you anywhere if you plug multiple devices phone tablet into your charger that are close to  be aware that you may drain the charger completely faq q can i use a charger underwater a no unless you specifically look for an underwater charger none of these are meant to be submerged q how do i know it’s fully charged a every device comes with an external meter that informs you of its power level that way you can visually see when the battery is at  and when it’s time for a recharge q how long does it take to charge a every device is different but the average amount of time it takes to go from  to  is about six hours q what kind of battery is inside a every manufacturer has a different design and model but the most common design is the lipolymer battery these batteries have thousands of power cells which store energy for a period of time but eventually dissipate when not being used q how long will it stay charged if i don’t use it a this is usually determined by the size of the battery and the amount of cells within it generally speaking a portable charger will lose all power

buying a charger that doesn’t suit your needs… or one that sits in a drawer most of the time for example a person who needs a charger for an overnight camping trip would probably do better with the introcircuit on our shortlist — which can charge two devices at once and includes an led flashlight — than the miniature anker the ravpower in our product matrix can be used to charge a laptop while this is a much longer process it works the same way as charging a phone or tablet — with the slight adjustment of having an extra device connected to one of your ports size and aesthetics with the exception of the anker which is about the size of a lipstick tube the average charger looks like a small brick dimensions vary between brands but most conform to a ”x” size with a thickness of ½” to ¾” they’re designed to easily fit in a pocket or suitcase bulk is generally not an issue with a portable charger each charger has its own aesthetic appeal which you can judge for yourself some are shiny and metallic some are plastic some have a rubber housing the ravpower and intocircuit models exude a sleek metallic finish the yellow and gray mycharge amp is shelled in a rubber casing that helps protect it against wear and tear the lenmar helix and anker have plastic casings the lenmar differs from many others on the market in that it is small and cylindrical like a lipstick tube in general it takes less time to charge a device with a portable charger than it does with a standard plug accessory weight while most chargers may look about the same they definitely don’t share the same weight as different chargers use different components the lightest of the bunch is the rubberencased mycharge weighing in at a surprising  ounces the plastic anker weighs more although it is still fairly light at  ounces the heaviest of the bunch is the ounce ravpower this one weighs more because it carries some extra tech as you’ll read below did you know you can have the charger plugged in while it’s recharging something ie charge both devices — charger and phonetablet — together just keep an eye on any overheating charging times charging times charging your charger’s battery every portable charger has a battery that must be charged if you don’t charge your charger’s battery it’s of little use to you because every battery is designed differently they all require a different amount of time to reach  all of the models on our shortlist require a period of about six hours to get from empty to full except the anker which only needs about four hours charging times charging your device regardless of which product you buy a portable charger will juice up your smartphone or tablet much faster than a standard usb cord plugged into an outlet or computer why do portable chargers work so fast simply put a charger’s goal is to send as much power as possible to whatever device it’s connected to as a result you end up getting about twice the amount of power from a portable charger as you would from an outlet this is a smart and effective way to cut down on charging times for phones and tablets that seem to take forever to refill would you like your phone fully charged in a matter of  minutes or so yes please one of the benefits of portable chargers is that you can mix and match tech with multiple companies and brands without suffering compatibility issues for example you could plug a samsung phone and an lg tablet into the same charger at the same time — as long as it has two ports usb ports the average heavyduty charger includes at least two usb ports so you can charge two devices at the same time for example the ravpower intocircuit and mycharge all boast a standard twoport design for those who need to charge multiple items at once the lenmar comes with three usb ports the only device on our list with a single port is the anker but in exchange for that it has a slim “pocket” design that’s great for people on the move the affordable anker comes in five cool colors black blue pink silver and gold accessories portable chargers aren’t usually big on accessories only one of the five chargers in our matrix includes an accessory you may find useful the introcircuit comes with a builtin led flashlight with a range up to  feet if you’re a camper this could prove to be handy some other brands also include this accessory with varying degrees of light range and brightness but if you’re considering a portable charger with a flashlight bear in mind that the flashlight draws from the same power as your device the longer you use the flashlight the less reserve power you have expert tip things charge at different speeds so if charging two devices expect one to finish quicker rafe   technologist product review professional lifespan will your portable charger last forever in a word no while chargers do an incredible job of keeping your personal tech at full battery keep in mind that you’re essentially buying a large battery when you buy a portable charger and all batteries have an expiration date the difference between a portable charger and a standard battery is that the battery’s “lifespan”  and subsequent expiration is more or less set in stone based on size and usage a charger’s lifespan has no set time and date used moderately a charger could last you two to five years used daily it’s more likely to last one or two years the ravpower is one of the pricier portable chargers on our list but according to the manufacturer it will provide  charges over the course of its battery life price now is a great time to snag a portable charger as prices have reduced significantly a year or two ago you’d be paying  for one the best models today you can buy a highend model like the ravpower for about  on a budget the anker sits under  this one could be the best bet for your cash if you’re a person who attends a lot of conventions or takes frequent work trips it’s a simple inexpensive device that can go with you anywhere if you plug multiple devices phone tablet into your charger that are close to  be aware that you may drain the charger completely faq q can i use a charger underwater a no unless you specifically look for an underwater charger none of these are meant to be submerged q how do i know it’s fully charged a every device comes with an external meter that informs you of its power level that way you can visually see when the battery is at  and when it’s time for a recharge q how long does it take to charge a every device is different but the average amount of time it takes to go from  to  is about six hours q what kind of battery is inside a every manufacturer has a different design and model but the most common design is the lipolymer battery these batteries have thousands of power cells which store energy for a period of time but eventually dissipate when not being used q how long will it stay charged if i don’t use it a this is usually determined by the size of the battery and the amount of cells within it generally speaking a portable charger will lose all power within a year of not being used devangana web producer heather vp of content gavin writer melissa senior editor × support us
