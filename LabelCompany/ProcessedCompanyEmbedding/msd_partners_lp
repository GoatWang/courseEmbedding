september   special committee of the board of directors northstar asset management group inc park avenue th floornew york new york  gentlemen msd partners lp msd capital lp and their respective affiliates collectively own  shares of the common stock of northstar asset management group inc nsam which represents approximately  of nsams outstanding common stock  as the largest stockholder of nsam we have been considering the proposed combination of nsam colony capital inc colony and northstar realty finance corp that was announced on june    as you are aware we have been a longterm investor in nsam we agree that the proposed combination has the potential to create significant value though scale cost synergies strategic focus and enhanced valuation  the combination could be a positive transformational transaction for all three companies  however we also believe that as currently structured the proposed combination does not provide sufficient value to nsams stockholders   in addition the currently proposed governance structure for the combined company falls short of good governance norms in many key respects  we believe these shortcomings will hinder the interest of all three companies stockholders in achieving the type of full valuation for the combined company that is rightfully accorded to public companies with the highest governance standards and with the best possible management alignment with shareholders  we have communicated to both the special committees advisors and the management of colony that we do not intend to vote for the transaction as currently proposed  we are available to engage in discussions at your convenience and to consider any modifications to the transaction that may be proposed and presented to nsam stockholders notwithstanding these efforts and particularly given that other nsam stockholders have stated publicly that they intend to vote against the proposed transaction it remains possible that nsam stockholders will not approve the pending combination  we trust that you will be exercising all of your duties as directors of nsam in good faith to ensure that nsam is best positioned to maximize value for its stockholders in such a scenario  as the companys largest stockholder we expect you to provide the oversight necessary to ensure that nsams management is focused solely on value maximization for all stockholders and that you will not allow any conflicts of interest especially those that might arise from the potential triggering of severance and change of control payments to impair what is in the best interests of nsam and all of its stockholders we look forward to discussing these important matters very truly yours msd partners lp and msd capital lp about msd capital lp
