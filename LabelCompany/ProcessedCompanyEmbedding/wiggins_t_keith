jayquan                                            when we hear people talk about hip hop greats that have passed  we often hear of tupac  biggie  jam master jay and maybe even scott la rock but very seldom is the name keith cowboy wiggins mentioned keith cowboy laid the foundation for the call  response tactics that we have seen almost every emcee use since the s everytime you hear throw your hands in the air  say hoooo etc etc you are listening to the creations of cowboy  unfortunately cowboy did not get the chance to see his contributions reach every corner of the globe its only right that cowboys story be told by those closest to him  his family members  fellow furious  brothers     grandmaster mele mel     mele mel  he was definitely the backbone of the group  and the most popular on stage with the crowd response even with working out  he would get down on the floor  do his push ups  then scorp started working out with him i didnt want to be the weakest link  so it was me cowboy  scorp working out cowboy had big arms  he didnt have big shoulders or anything  but he definitely had some big guns so we got into the whole fintness thing through working out with cowboy   jayquan  im told basically that cowboy was the first emcee   mel  yeah  it wasnt even called emceeing back then  but he was the first to get on flashes mic and do the crowd response  without a doubt   jq  how did the  emcees cowboy  mele mel  kid creole form i know cowboy was first  how did you  cre join    mel  we used to dance for flash we were called the d squad  before we started rocking the mic flash would just put the mic down  cowboy was the main one on the mic me  creole would be in the house writing routines  and we just started to grab the mic our routine was a lot more polished than the average person when we first started doing our indoor parties in the fall of  we would put on our flyers flash  the  emcees the whole hit was from summer to winter you did the parties in the summer to get the rep to do the fall  winter you couldnt do indoor parties in the summer unless you were kool herc  cus no one would come inside   jq i have been told that the whole intro that wonder mike does on rappers delight is actually part of cowboys routine   mel  without a doubt this kid named  kokomo was going to the army  cowboy was messin with him teasing him with the marching hip hop rythm hiphophiphop  and he just took it on from there and kept goin with it it just took on a life of its own       scorpio   he was the strength of the furious   and he really kept us together  not just on the mic but his strength kept us in check with each other if anyone went far left  he was the one to make sure that we got back we didnt only respect him for who he was  but he was stronger than all of us  and he would knock you out  dont get me wrong  its not like we had a violent relationship in the furious  but if you got him to a certain level its like if he said its goin down like this  you had to respect it he never got irrate like that unless something was happening that affected the five of us  and he would step in he also kept just the average street people off of us too its not like we were a bunch of punks  but he was just the one the rest of us were way more diplomatic  where if somethin happened we would try to talk it out before it got to that if someone said somethin negative about the furious he would just knockem out it sounds negative  but comin up the way that we did  you needed people like that around you thats just the street level  as far as his character besides being the first emcee people perceive mel as being the top guy in our group  and he was the top lyricist  but nobody could rock the crowd like cowboy he could rock any crowd with no script   nothing written down he would step on stage  ask did yall see the knicks game tonight  just stuff that nobody else was sayin on stage  in addition to the say ho  he had the ability to really personalize the whole crowd like he knew everybody in there that was his gift  his trademark even back then he said stuff  like all the single moms and all the sexy ladies say  owwww it was different hearing it back then because no one had said it before it even took mel some time to gain his power  like a couple of records  but when we first went out on the road with superrappin  freedom  birthday party  its nasty it was all about cowboy after the concert we would all be tryin to get girls and we would have no girls cowboy would have  or  in his room  it wasnt like they would settle for just anyone in the group  they specifically wanted cowboy i didnt get the rep as a ladies man until the stage shows really developed   the era of rick james  super freak  thats how i came into my own but before me it was all about him  till the point that it almost wasnt fair we came out  posed and sweated and all he had to do was walk out with his bow legs we had to settle for straight cookie monsters in the early days  cus all the fly ones wanted cowboy he was the personable one in the group   and i know for a fact that if he was still alive we would still be together the stuff that flash is doin now  only performing by himself  no way that would happen if cowboy was still alive cowboy would physically walk up to him  break everything down to him  give him an option  just that simple either you get yo ass back together with this group that we all built  or im gon knock you out  thats who he was and we all understood it  respected and knew that if he said it he meant it one time we was on the road overseas and he missed the plane i just so happened to call his house because i have a child with his sister i heard him yellin in the background watch when they come back  thats aight watch we left him  cus mel was tryin to teach him a lesson about being late we had about  shows left  and i was countin the days and literally walkin on air i knew it was comin mel aint even know  and i was so shook that i aint even tell him but i knew that he loved money  so when we got off the plane i was like yo i got a couple of dollars for you he aint even say nothin that might sound weird but it really wasnt one of those torturous relationships  or on the level of him bullying us   in fact it was really that he had so much love for us that he was protectin us   but with the des moines iowa show i knew that as soon as i heard the crowd yellin and cussin  that cowboy was gonna react and he did he started rumblin with all of em  throwing chairs and everything he even got stabbed     i remember he had just gotten out of jail  and the latin quarters had just opened and it was mad brooklyn nigas   stick up kids and all that we knew em all  but they would flip at any given time we brought cowboy down there to party on his first night out he got on the  mic and tore the crowd to pieces we went down stairs and people were fightin i had been there so much that i knew all the back rooms and stuff  so i tried to tell cowboy lets go over here he was like i aint movin  i aint goin nowhere he was standin there almost like he was daring one of those brooklyn cats to run up on him this is who he was he stood there with so much pride like a warrior its not like he was a knuckle head or anything like that  he just felt like the fighting had nothin to do with him  so he wasnt movin   how did the dynamics of the group change for the period that it was just you  mel  cowboy    well at first it was just me  mel  then i saw that some money might be comin in  so i said to cowboy lets do what we have to for now but for a point i wasnt even down i had a deal with def jam  but sugarhill records interfered with it me  ll were the first ones to get contracts from def jam i only went back to sugarhill because they were blockin everything that i was tryin to do at first even mel left for a brief time the whole group walked i guess sylvia got in mels ear  and he was the first to go back flash took me to elektra to talk to them when he was puttin his new group together  but somethin didnt feel right so i didnt mess with either one for a minute     did cowboy ever try to get the group back together initially   no because we stayed busy soon after we decided that it would be me  him  mel  so it never got time to really sink in we were touring big when step off came out i do remember that he didnt like the direction that we were goin in musically he felt the records were almost like rock  roll  and i wish we had listened cus he said we need to make records with just beats and right after run  dmc came out with just beats cowboy really knew what the streets wanted to hear  and neither me or mel listened     at the time of the on the strength lp i t seems cowboy was deep in that life  do you think that there is anything that any of you could have done to prevent what happened     no not really he was stayin with his stepdad in queensbridge and we thought that he was being looked after me  mel just basically up  left and went to cali we didnt really have our ear to the streets when i heard that he died i was shocked  i didnt know he was sick or nothin and to be honest at that point we became so consumed with our own stuff that we became almost selfish and was just tryin to make it the group was all over the place  and everybody was tryin to do somethin but it was all amounting to nothin     rahiem     i can concur with what everyone else says as far as him being the enforcer of the group when anyone tried to take advantage of  us especially by force he would always be one to say its not goin down like that in fact i nicknamed him  and  because whenever he had a fight with someone he knocked em out with one punch   i remember one time when we were at the peak of our succsess we would have contests to see who could get the most ass in one night  and mel  scorp were always roommates  and me  cowboy were roommates  and i remember specifically that cowboy came in first  and i came in second this was when we were touring with rick james  teena marie  cameo  the barkays  confunkshun  switch  the commodores  when lionel ritchie was still with them   not to get too far off subject  but how were you received by those groups   well at first with some reluctance a group like cameo  we were in awe of the their stage show  their presence like they had a walk  where they would walk in formation and everyone in the group  looked in the direction they walked in  not deviating from that direction we were in awe of it  and trying to befriend them to get some kind of professional take on what they think that we needed to do to enhance our stage performance they were on some real military type shit and wouldnt talk to us after awhile larry blackmon started talking to flash  but until we studied their stage show we werent on their level  we sat in the audience every night and studied them we were on a six month tour  and about two months into the tour we started bustin they ass  when we started we were the opening act  but by the end of the tour we had to close the shows unless maybe rick james was on that date we had to close even when he was there sometimes he would be too physically exhausted to take the show over the top  and he would have us close it   cowboys signature was the crowd motivation cowboy was actually the first emcee i was the last member to join the group and when cowboy joined i was probably too young  to go to parties  or i may have been at my first kool herc party when cowboy started emceeing nobody was rhyming on beat and doing crowd response before cowboy not hollywood   nobody   but that concert where cowboy got stabbed in des moines  iowa we were doing a show with midnight star  some more acts someone announced to the crowd that we were there and refused to go on  but they failed to tell them that the reason why was because the promoter didnt have our money the whole crowd seemed incited to come to our dressing room and confront us by one seemingly drunk individual this guy along with about  other people came to our dressing room  we were working out and cowboy had a dumbbell in his hand that was maybe  lbs or so we were in the conference center of this hotel  and people were picking up ceramic ashtrays and flower pots and launching them with all their might at our dressing room door if we werent so angry about it  it could have been a very intimidating and life threatening situation cowboy set it off by throwing the dumbbell at the door  and it burst open i think that the crowd thought that we were shooting at them so they dispursed we went out to confront the people still talking trash including the drunk guy cowboy  ez mike  someone else picked up a conference table  and kind of like on the old batman  robin when they picked up a table and ran with it and pinned the guy to the wall with the table the drunken guy pulls out a knife and cowboy  the guy begin wrestling and thats where the stitches came from   i listened to the message lp the other day and i heard dreamin and you are in their entirety for the first time  and they are very well written and produced  did you write them both   i wrote dreamin and a guy named gary henry wrote you are christopher williams and i wrote dreamin together i told the robinsons that someone else wrote the song with me  but they left him out   after the split did both factions get along   for awhile we were arch enemies in fact i think step off was directed towards me in some ways when i first got in the group  and for awhile after i was seen as the best next to mel i guess that was mels way of lettin me know that he is gonna be who he is without me   when if ever did drug use begin to affect the performance of the group   strangely enough i think our performance was never affected  but more so our judgement  and how we conducted our business we are in the music business and a lot of people in that era took the business part for granted  because we were having fun  and traveling to places where most people our age  or people in general wouldnt see in their lifetime  and we got paid for it ultimately i think that played a part in the demise of the group  and it became visible around  we had been dabbling from  till about  it came to a head in about   especially for me  and i have no problem talking about it because i am  years clean drug free   you look younger today than you did  years ago in the s   thank you i think that i am still supposed to be here doin this  and thats the reason   how did you improvise live for mels solo joints   well i did duke bootees parts even in the message video i lipsync his parts originally i did his parts on the song  but sylvia got mad at me because my mom got us a lawyer right before we recorded the message i was  and my mom was supposed to sign the contract for me and never did when i turned  she got us a lawyer who advised us against signing it at all she was mad at my mom  so she didnt allow my voice on the song   where is the reluctance to perform with flash coming from   from flash when we started to make records  and when we became recording artists his role signifigantly changed  and he is uncomfortable with the role that he plays he didnt have much of a voice in where we went creatively  even though we listened to his suggestions a great deal  but when it came time to record sylvia made the final call  and took all credit for production                                          neicy cowboys sister     jayquan  to your knowledge how did cowboy get into music    neicy cowboys sister  he used to be in the house bangin on furniture and just rhymin he used to get all the guys from the block   and they would form a circle  do their thing this was before he met any of the furious    jq did he know any of the members of the furious   before they formed the group   n he knew of them they were basically just doin the same thing that my brother was doin they didnt go to the same schools or anything like that   jq when they first started making records what was it like in your household   n well  flash was by himself  doin block parties or whatever  and my brother would just get on the mic he was the only one that would get up there  and he was a crowd pleaser by himself then the rest of the guys came along one by one when they started making records it was real exciting i got a chance to do some traveling with them  mostly when they were in new york scorpio  i have a child together also   jq  was that awkward dating scorpio  being that he was in a group with your brother were there any problems between the  as a result   n no  not at all   jq i have heard that cowboy was nice with his hands   n i didnt wanna go there with you cus thats my brother and i didnt want it to sound like i was braggin about that  but anytime the group had any static my brother was there  and took up for the whole group thats how he got  stitches in a stabbing incedent   jq i heard his rhyme where he says been rockin that party  years of my life  been shot wit a gunstabbed wit a knife    n yep if there was ever a time when promoters didnt wanna pay  cowboy would handle that  and get everybody paid   jq when you traveled with them  did you get a chance to meet any other celebrities n oh yeah  rick james  eddie murphy lots of people   jq im told by more than one person that cowboy started the term hip hop   n yeah  you know how he started it   j yes   n what did you hear   j i heard that someone was going to the army  and he was teasin em goin  hiphophiphop   n yep  yep thats itand then he started goin further into the hip hip hop bop bop ya dont stop he even had us goin along with him we didnt know what he was sayin  but we went right along   j did you ever go to the studio while they were recording   n yes we met joey  sylvia robinson   j it always sounded like a party in the background of those records  and i wondered if that was family members or what   n yeah  my mother and i   j whats your favorite record by them   n the message     kid creole       creoleon that term hip hop a friend of ours named billy was about to go to the army   i think this was  we had a party at the black door over on boston rd  th st that was one of the first places that my brother  my self  cowboy played as the  emcees  along with flash this was billys last weekend before shipping out  and cowboy was on the mic playin around doing that army cadence  hip  hophip hop  but he was doin it to music and people was diggin on it so we never thought much of it disco was king at the time  and the disco crowd referred to us as those hip hoppers  but they used it as a  derogatory term but cowboy was the first one i heard do that to music  as part of his crowd response   jayquan so he did something similar to what wonder mike is doin at the beginning of rappers delight   cre except for all that ole bang bang boogie shit   the intro to rappers delight is what cowboy used to say word for word except that up jump the boogie shit up jump the boogie was some disco shit   jq when i ask some of the first emcees who the first person was that they saw emcee they usually say either you  mel or cowboy but many times they say just cowboy where as far as you know did he get it from   cre well cowboy never really wrote rhymes he would say like lil nursery rhymes like everybody else the first person that i heard say a rhymeand not just a phrase  like at hercs parties where clark kent  timmy tim would say givin  ya more than what you paid at the door  on down to the am the first person that i heard say a rhyme that wasnt a nursery rhyme was my brother mel he was the very first person that i saw say a rhyme about themselves not a poem  a bonafide rhyme thats what motivated me to rhyme  cus mel was on the mic and he was getting girls i couldnt just stand on the sidelines cowboy was a guy who had no fear of just getting in front of a crowd  and asking them to do what he wanted it was a time when people in hip hop werent doing that the only other person who did it to any degree  on purpose was  djhollywood let me tell you a story about cowboy   we had just made freedom cowboy got into a beef with his girl and  it escalated into a misunderstanding well her brother got involved i was at my sisters house and it was like  in the morning  and we all had these mini  motorcycles nias called me at  in the mornin i got my lil brother on the back we all met over at cowboys house in the bronx  crotona park north off of prospect ave her brother had his people were out there  cowboys stepfather  duke had his hardware  i had mine so we werent worried about somebody doin something stupid plus this was like  so we didnt have a mentality like we were gonna go hurt nobody  but cowboy didnt appreciate them comin up into his crib  and he had to leave out of the fire escape window to get away from them so it comes down to cowboy is about to fight this girls brother so we go in the park right across the street  and cowboy and this dude square off cowboy hit him with about  good shots to his headboom boom boom the kid bent over  fights over thats my word  if you got him mad  cowboy would ball his fist up and be ready to fight right then  there  no question if you got him riled up you couldnt talk to him   another time in about  or so we were on a tiger flowers promotion company tour in des moines iowa we were doin a show on a tuesday cus during the week the tour wasnt rolling and we did a show at the holiday inn in the ballroom we were getting like  dollars for the show  but at that time we were usually getting like  dollars so it didnt  mean that much to us  just something to keep us goin when we got there it was a nice crowd  and we  would have gone on in front of  people just so the promoter paid us the promoter was like the town pimp from all accounts   and to make a long story short he didnt come up with the money we werent gonna go on  because we dont make it a habit of doing shows without getting paid first we were in the dressing room and here comes the bootleg promoter with a couple other guys saying that he is gonna make us go on the promoter stuck his foot in the door so that we couldnt close it  and one of our security guys  joe was closing the door on the guys foot when the crowd found out what was goin on  they started throwing everything that wasnt nailed down they turned on us along with the promoter and his boys it sounded like  people knocking at the door we were in the dressing room  and our bus is outside they were tearing up the holiday inn  the police werent comin mel was into weights even back then and we had a bunch in the dressing room  so we took them apart   anything that we could use for a weapon mel used to bring a baseball bat onstage   and we had that i had a weight bar we decided that we had to make it to the bus we counted to   there was maybe  or  of us we busted out the door and started wailing on people they were throwing stuff at us  and we were trying to protect ourselves the promoter tries to make his way to us with a knife cowboy grabs him  starts to tussle  and the guy is bigger than cowboy the guy stabs cowboy twice reggie  joe  two of our security men take a table and run the guy up against the wall with it cowboy had like  stitches in his arm and  in his side the next day we did a showthats the kind of trooper he was the next day we were performing      jq im gonna ask you about some furious  recordings  and i want you to tell me the first thought  memory or story associated with that song   freedom  ahhh the very first time that we went on a real concert tour it was so foreign to have a big crowd  and fans come afterwards also to have people recognize you we were known in the bronx to some degree cus we did our thing  but not in this way it would be even different today because you have mtv  the media involved in hip hop for instance when i went with flash  rahiem and our new line up we went on the fresh fest tour and got arrested in providence rhode island for beatin up a bootleg t shirt seller there was no media coverage except right there in providence if that was today it would be on mtv news  the internet and everywhere but our lives just changed we went from being a regional act that played in gymnasiums  and if we were lucky gymnasiums that had a stage  to going on tours in different cities and playing arenas that basketball teams played in real teams that we knew of  and eventually some of the players attended our shows it was incredibly exciting   its nasty  thats when we started goin to the south a lot and doing more shows also going overseas the first time we went to london we fit right in with all the wild dressing  the leather pants  studs  spikes   jq  is it true that when you opened up for the clash the crowd booed you   cre yeah that was right here in the states  that was in manhattan at bonds international it used to be a clothing store  but when they went out of business it was turned into a club when we first started doin shows the second set of uniforms that we bought were black velvet with rhinestones  but this was a rock crowd  and people had stayed  or  days outside of bonds international waitin for tickets we had just done freedom and we had to do  shows the crowd had the wild hair dos and black lipstick  you know a punk rock crowd well hip hop wasnt like that back then  they didnt wanna hear it at all they started throwing stuff at us flash got so nervous that his ear started bleeding  sht  the second show we wore our dungarees  and we threw stuff back    birthday party we released that right after freedom we did a lot of commercials for radio stations off of birthday party that song was basically mels idea   the message  none of us really wanted to do it especially the rest of us  because we didnt really have a part in it before the message anything that we wanted to say creatively we said it now someone was telling us that we couldnt say anything after awhile sylvia made up her mind that we were the right type of group to do that song  coming from the inner city and everything we would be believable doing it  and none of her other groups would but she was gonna have her way on that one  as far as mel being the only one to do that song it worked out for the best  but i wish that i had gotten the chance to say somethin on it though the rest of us came up with the idea for the arrest skit at the end so that we would have a chance to say something   showdown  was sugarhill gang in the studio with younah we recorded that at different times them fake emcees didnt wanna be in the same room with us   jq why was cowboy not pictured on the on the strength photo sessions     cre he had just gotten out of jail  which made it possible for elektra to sign us as a group i was ok with the group getting back together  but i wish that we could have still kept our faction together   jq  what was the most memorable time that you had on the road with either the original line up  or the group after the split   cre the tiger flower tours with the original group because they were professional tours and we would go on the radio  in different cities  it was a lot of fun   another thing about cowboy was that he was a huge dallas cowboy fan thats not why we called him cowboy it was because of his bow legs  and he walked like the cowboys on the old westerns he was very athletic also him and mel were always doing push ups together  stuff like that he was always playing basketball  football it really surprised me when he started messin with crack i can also say that he loved his kids  cowboy really loved his kids the people that represent us as far as people using our stuff  they make sure that he gets his  th percentage   jq not to get too personal  but is that  a good source of income for you i know that will smith  ll cool j have used some of your stuff   cre it aint enough to get that benz that i want  but it helps every now  again   but lastly about cowboy  when he was alive and we started to do parties together he  i used to smoke dust together  we lived in the same neighborhood and we were best friends we were mad mad close before we started making records together we hung out everyday its not fair to say that we were like brothers  but we were mad close the fact that the industry does not recognize or try to remember cowboy is bad for me we didnt do all that much in the industry where they might give a tribute to him  but he did a lot for the seed that grew  and the terms that he used are still used till this day its sad that the group couldnt stay together long enough to make sure that cowboys memory was firmly entrenched in hip hop history its disappointing that hip hop turned its back on cowboy  not that someone purposely tried to make sure that his name is not recognized in the industry  but im just disappointed that its not      jq what are your  favorite breakbeats to rhyme over  and give me  honorable mentions   cre  a joint by passport called ju ju man  sing sing sing  way way back before we started rhyming rhythmically i liked to rhyme to the bra two honorable mentions are i cant stop  apache     jq  what is your favorite song that you made after the split   cre  larrys dance theme   jq lastly when you guys performed the song scorpio on stage  how was it done being that the song had the vocorder in it   cre we just let it play  kinda talked over it we wanted to bring a vocorder on stage  but sylvia would have to pay for it  and make an instrumental copy  and she never wanted to do anything to enhance the group in that sense                                                                        š   mic media  no part may be copied
