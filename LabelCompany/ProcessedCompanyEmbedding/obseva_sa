combined with different doses of addback therapy obe is a novel oral gnrh receptor antagonist that is currently in a phase b clinical trial for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis em and in phase  clinical trials for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding hmb associated with uterine fibroids uf in premenopausal women although estrogen e suppression is a wellvalidated strategy for alleviating symptoms of uf and em therapeutic benefit can be compromised by hypoestrogenic effects principally bone mineral density bmd loss this often necessitates administration of addback therapy abt to patients which delivers estrogenprogestogens to counteract the deleterious effects of bmd the ongoing obe development program is investigating two complementary approaches to achieving what obseva believes is the optimal estrogen level to find a balance between efficacy and side effects the first approach is to use a low dose of obe that targets an e range of  to  pgml without the addition of addback therapy the second approach targets maximal e suppression with a high dose of obe combined with addback therapy to bring exogenous e back to the desired level that is intended to aid bmd safety the present phase  clinical trial reported herein aimed to evaluate the pharmacodynamics safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of the oral gnrh receptor antagonist obe alone or

million based on the initial public offering price of  per common share after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering together with our existing cash and cash equivalents as follows • approximately  million to advance the development of obe • approximately  million to advance the development of obe • approximately  million to advance the development of obe and • the remainder to fund other research and development activities as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes including to pursue our strategy to inlicense or acquire additional product candidates although we have no agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or inlicenses as of the date of this prospectus this expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors including the progress of our development the status of and results from clinical trials as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs as a result our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of those net proceeds pending these uses we plan to invest these net proceeds in shortterm interest bearing deposits based on the planned use of proceeds described above we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for more than  months we anticipate these funds will be sufficient for the completion of our phase b clinical trial of obe in patients with endometriosis the initiation of our two phase  clinical trials of obe in patients with uterine fibroids the initiation and completion of our european phase  clinical trial of obe in women undergoing ivf and the completion of our phase  and ddi clinical trials and the subsequent initiation and completion of a phase  clinical trial of obe for the treatment of preterm labor we anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete our two phase  clinical trials of obe in patients with uterine fibroids we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect biopharmaceutical product development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements our success is highly dependent upon our ability to inlicense acquire develop and obtain regulatory approval for new and innovative products on a costeffective basis and to market them successfully in doing so we face and will continue to face intense competition from a variety of businesses including large fully integrated wellestablished pharmaceutical companies who already possess a large share of the market specialty pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies academic institutions government agencies and other private and public research institutions in the european union united states and other jurisdictions with respect to obe there are no gnrh antagonists currently approved for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis or heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids however we are aware that abbvie inc myovant sciences inc and astellas pharma inc are developing gnrh antagonist product candidates for treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids we also anticipate competing with gnrh agonists including lupron leuprolide acetate marketed by abbvie inc and takeda pharmaceuticals visanne which is approved for the treatment of endometriosis outside the united states and marketed by bayer ulipristal acetate which is approved for the treatment of moderatetosevere symptoms of uterine fibroids outside the united states and marketed by gedeon richter in europe and other regions and by actavis allergan in canada actavis allergan has stated that it expects to submit an nda for ulipristal acetate with the fda in  in addition oral contraceptives and nsaids are routinely used as a firstline therapy for treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids and have a meaningful success rate at mitigating the symptoms associated with these conditions with respect to obe there are no oxytocin receptor antagonists approved for use in connection with ivf however we are aware that ferring pharmaceuticals inc has been developing barusiban an oxytocin receptor antagonist to be administered subcutaneously for use in connection with ivf ferring pharmaceuticals’ atosiban an oxytocin receptor antagonist has been used in investigator initiated trials in connection with ivf outside the united states with respect to obe we anticipate competing with atosiban which has been approved to delay preterm birth outside of the united states as well as currently available prostaglandin inhibitors such as nsaids we are also aware that glaxosmithkline is developing retosiban an oxytocin receptor antagonist to delay preterm birth we may also compete with other companies acquiring and developing or marketing drug therapies or products for women’s reproductive health diseases many of the companies against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development manufacturing preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved drugs than we do mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical industry could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors smaller or earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than obe obe or obe or any other product candidate that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy convenience tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful in addition established biopharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to inlicense novel compounds that could make obe obe obe or any of our future product candidates less competitive company description we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman’s reproductive health and pregnancy our goal is to build the leading women’s reproductive health and pregnancy company focused on conditions where current treatment options are limited and significant unmet needs exist we are focused on providing therapeutic solutions for women between the ages of  and  who suffer from reproductive health conditions that affect their quality of life ability to conceive or that complicate pregnancy and the health of newborns there are millions of women of reproductive age affected by conditions such as endometriosis uterine fibroids and preterm labor or that require in vitro fertilization or ivf to conceive our most advanced product candidates are designed to address the symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids and to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing ivf endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus called the endometrium grows outside of the uterus causing monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory reactions inside the abdomen that may result in ovarian cyst formation scar tissue and adhesions uterine fibroids also known as leiomyomata or myoma are common noncancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and have disabling symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding we are also developing a product candidate to treat preterm labor we are advancing a pipeline of orallyadministered innovative new chemical entities or nces for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids improvement of clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing ivf and treatment of preterm labor  we were founded in november  by former executives of preglem sa or preglem a swissbased specialty biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative drugs for women’s reproductive health while at preglem our senior management team collaborated in the clinical development and commercialization of several women’s reproductive health therapeutics including esmya ulipristal acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroids preglem was subsequently acquired by gedeon richter in  we believe we will be able to leverage our senior management team’s longstanding experience working together and with key opinion leaders patient groups payors reproductive health networks fertility clinics obstetricians and gynecologists or obgyns nurses and pharmacists to identify inlicense or acquire develop and commercialize product candidates our portfolio currently consists of three inlicensed nces in clinical development for four indications intended to address areas that we believe present significant unmet medical needs obe for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids we are developing obe as a novel oral gonadotropinreleasing hormone or gnrh receptor antagonist which is a type of drug that binds to the receptor and thus inhibits gnrh from eliciting a response from the same receptor for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women as of  we believe that approximately  million women in the united states were diagnosed and being treated for endometriosis and the majority of those women experience significant pain during menstrual periods according to a study published in the american journal of obstetrics  gynecology in  uterine fibroids affect an estimated  to  of women over the age of  in the united states based on clinical cases and women who undergo treatment in  we inlicensed obe from kissei pharmaceutical co ltd or kissei a japanese pharmaceutical company prior to inlicensing obe kissei completed a preclinical program a phase  clinical trial in healthy female volunteers of japanese and european descent and three phase a clinical trials in patients of japanese descent with endometriosis including one trial that included a subgroup of patients with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids in these trials obe was observed to have a linear pharmacokinetic or pk profile a predictable dosedependent suppression of estradiol which is a form of the hormone estrogen and a dose range that was welltolerated and provided symptom relief a drug’s pk profile refers to the specific way in which a given drug is handled by the body over time including the particular patterns of the specified drug’s absorption distribution and elimination from the body while a drug’s pharmacodynamic or pd profile refers to the biochemical and physiological effects of a drug on the body we expect obe to potentially reduce pain symptoms associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids while mitigating bone mineral density loss and other adverse effects associated with excessive estradiol suppression we are currently conducting a multipledose placebocontrolled phase b clinical trial of obe in patients with endometriosis across  sites in the united states and  sites in central and eastern europe with a target enrollment of  patients which we refer to as the edelweiss clinical trial we expect to report the primary efficacy results from the week evaluation period of the edelweiss clinical trial in the first half of  for the uterine fibroids indication we intend to commence a phase  clinical program with two phase  clinical trials which we refer to as the primrose clinical trials in the first half of  we expect to report data from these phase  primrose clinical trials in the first half of  there are currently no gnrh receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids however we are aware that abbvie inc myovant sciences inc and astellas pharma inc are developing gnrh receptor antagonists for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids based on publicly available information for these other products in development we believe obe has the following potential advantages • favorable and consistent pk profile obe has been observed to have a consistent pk profile and low variability due to high bioavailability and low volume of distribution we believe some of the competitive product candidates have low bioavailability and high volume of distribution due to drug accumulation in fat which we believe may translate into variable efficacy and safety in addition obe’s halflife allows for once daily dosing across indications while one of the competitive product candidates is being developed for twice daily dosing • personalized dosing based on obe’s consistent pk and pd profiles observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials we are currently evaluating personalized dosing that can be tailored to a patient’s individual response we believe this may allow us to pursue a label for varied dosing based on a patient’s estradiol levels and symptoms we believe other products in clinical development are currently only being evaluated for one or two dosing options which do not appear to account for individual patient characteristics individual response or patient preference • no systematic need for addback therapy for symptoms associated with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids we are developing obe as a standalone treatment without need for addback therapy and in association with addback therapy fixeddose combination therapy to fulfill the needs of a broad patient population with endometriosis or uterine fibroids addback therapy refers to the administration of additional estrogen during treatment to counteract the side effects of excessive suppression of estradiol we believe at least one other product in clinical development is only being evaluated as a fixeddose combination therapy that includes addback therapy which we believe may not be suitable for treatment of women with poor tolerance or contraindications to addback therapy we also believe that at least one of the other products in clinical development has demonstrated at the dose being developed in the clinical trials a bone mineral density loss at  weeks of treatment comparable to lupron a gnrh agonist used for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids • compliance benefit obe may have an advantage in patient compliance due to the lack of observed food effect and the ability to be taken once anytime throughout the day as compared to certain of the competitive product candidates which we believe need to be taken on an empty stomach obe nolasiban to improve ivf outcomes we are developing obe nolasiban an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing ivf in europe approximately  ivf treatments were performed in  and in the united states approximately  ivf treatments were performed in  the ivf process has an overall live birth rate of approximately  in the united states and  in europe we inlicensed obe from merck serono which previously completed preclinical studies and phase  clinical trials in  healthy female volunteers that evaluated the safety and pk profile of obe in  we completed our patient phase  clinical trial of obe in women undergoing ivf in this phase  clinical trial obe did not reach the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rate at six weeks after embryo transfer in our posthoc analysis which excluded patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool we identified a statistically significant doseproportional increase in pregnancy rate at  weeks as well as live birth rates we believe that high progesterone levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window based on these results we intend to initiate a european phase  clinical trial in women undergoing ivf in the first half of  and expect to report data for the primary endpoint in the second quarter of  obe for the treatment of preterm labor we are developing obe an oral and selective prostaglandin f or pgf receptor antagonist as a once daily treatment for preterm labor in weeks  to  of pregnancy preterm labor defined as the body commencing the birthing process prior to  weeks is characterized by uterine contractions cervical dilation and rupture of the fetal membranes that surround and protect the fetus during pregnancy preterm labor can lead to preterm birth which is currently the leading worldwide cause of death of newborn babies according to the national center for health statistics approximately  of babies in the united states were born preterm in  we inlicensed obe from merck serono in  based on its pk profile and efficacy observed in animal models we believe obe has the potential to become a firstinclass therapy to suppress preterm labor and delay or avoid preterm birth without significant safety concerns for the fetus we are currently conducting a phase  clinical trial assessing the safety tolerability and pk profile of obe in healthy postmenopausal female volunteers after single doses of  mg to  mg and multiple doses between  mg per day and  mg per day over  consecutive days based on preliminary data obe was observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be welltolerated at doses up to  mg after single dose administration and up to  mg per day after multiple dose administration over  days each of which are above the estimated clinical effective dose  we are a swiss stock corporation société anonyme organized under the laws of switzerland we were formed in

earlystage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer more effective have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient or are less expensive than obe obe or obe or any other product candidate that we may develop our competitors also may obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market any new product that competes with an approved product must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy convenience tolerability and safety in order to overcome price competition and to be commercially successful in addition established biopharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to inlicense novel compounds that could make obe obe obe or any of our future product candidates less competitive company description we are a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman’s reproductive health and pregnancy our goal is to build the leading women’s reproductive health and pregnancy company focused on conditions where current treatment options are limited and significant unmet needs exist we are focused on providing therapeutic solutions for women between the ages of  and  who suffer from reproductive health conditions that affect their quality of life ability to conceive or that complicate pregnancy and the health of newborns there are millions of women of reproductive age affected by conditions such as endometriosis uterine fibroids and preterm labor or that require in vitro fertilization or ivf to conceive our most advanced product candidates are designed to address the symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids and to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing ivf endometriosis is an often painful disorder in which tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus called the endometrium grows outside of the uterus causing monthly bleeding and chronic inflammatory reactions inside the abdomen that may result in ovarian cyst formation scar tissue and adhesions uterine fibroids also known as leiomyomata or myoma are common noncancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and have disabling symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding we are also developing a product candidate to treat preterm labor we are advancing a pipeline of orallyadministered innovative new chemical entities or nces for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis and uterine fibroids improvement of clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing ivf and treatment of preterm labor  we were founded in november  by former executives of preglem sa or preglem a swissbased specialty biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative drugs for women’s reproductive health while at preglem our senior management team collaborated in the clinical development and commercialization of several women’s reproductive health therapeutics including esmya ulipristal acetate for the treatment of uterine fibroids preglem was subsequently acquired by gedeon richter in  we believe we will be able to leverage our senior management team’s longstanding experience working together and with key opinion leaders patient groups payors reproductive health networks fertility clinics obstetricians and gynecologists or obgyns nurses and pharmacists to identify inlicense or acquire develop and commercialize product candidates our portfolio currently consists of three inlicensed nces in clinical development for four indications intended to address areas that we believe present significant unmet medical needs obe for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids we are developing obe as a novel oral gonadotropinreleasing hormone or gnrh receptor antagonist which is a type of drug that binds to the receptor and thus inhibits gnrh from eliciting a response from the same receptor for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women as of  we believe that approximately  million women in the united states were diagnosed and being treated for endometriosis and the majority of those women experience significant pain during menstrual periods according to a study published in the american journal of obstetrics  gynecology in  uterine fibroids affect an estimated  to  of women over the age of  in the united states based on clinical cases and women who undergo treatment in  we inlicensed obe from kissei pharmaceutical co ltd or kissei a japanese pharmaceutical company prior to inlicensing obe kissei completed a preclinical program a phase  clinical trial in healthy female volunteers of japanese and european descent and three phase a clinical trials in patients of japanese descent with endometriosis including one trial that included a subgroup of patients with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids in these trials obe was observed to have a linear pharmacokinetic or pk profile a predictable dosedependent suppression of estradiol which is a form of the hormone estrogen and a dose range that was welltolerated and provided symptom relief a drug’s pk profile refers to the specific way in which a given drug is handled by the body over time including the particular patterns of the specified drug’s absorption distribution and elimination from the body while a drug’s pharmacodynamic or pd profile refers to the biochemical and physiological effects of a drug on the body we expect obe to potentially reduce pain symptoms associated with endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids while mitigating bone mineral density loss and other adverse effects associated with excessive estradiol suppression we are currently conducting a multipledose placebocontrolled phase b clinical trial of obe in patients with endometriosis across  sites in the united states and  sites in central and eastern europe with a target enrollment of  patients which we refer to as the edelweiss clinical trial we expect to report the primary efficacy results from the week evaluation period of the edelweiss clinical trial in the first half of  for the uterine fibroids indication we intend to commence a phase  clinical program with two phase  clinical trials which we refer to as the primrose clinical trials in the first half of  we expect to report data from these phase  primrose clinical trials in the first half of  there are currently no gnrh receptor antagonists approved for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids however we are aware that abbvie inc myovant sciences inc and astellas pharma inc are developing gnrh receptor antagonists for the treatment of symptoms associated with endometriosis or uterine fibroids based on publicly available information for these other products in development we believe obe has the following potential advantages • favorable and consistent pk profile obe has been observed to have a consistent pk profile and low variability due to high bioavailability and low volume of distribution we believe some of the competitive product candidates have low bioavailability and high volume of distribution due to drug accumulation in fat which we believe may translate into variable efficacy and safety in addition obe’s halflife allows for once daily dosing across indications while one of the competitive product candidates is being developed for twice daily dosing • personalized dosing based on obe’s consistent pk and pd profiles observed in preclinical studies and clinical trials we are currently evaluating personalized dosing that can be tailored to a patient’s individual response we believe this may allow us to pursue a label for varied dosing based on a patient’s estradiol levels and symptoms we believe other products in clinical development are currently only being evaluated for one or two dosing options which do not appear to account for individual patient characteristics individual response or patient preference • no systematic need for addback therapy for symptoms associated with both endometriosis and uterine fibroids we are developing obe as a standalone treatment without need for addback therapy and in association with addback therapy fixeddose combination therapy to fulfill the needs of a broad patient population with endometriosis or uterine fibroids addback therapy refers to the administration of additional estrogen during treatment to counteract the side effects of excessive suppression of estradiol we believe at least one other product in clinical development is only being evaluated as a fixeddose combination therapy that includes addback therapy which we believe may not be suitable for treatment of women with poor tolerance or contraindications to addback therapy we also believe that at least one of the other products in clinical development has demonstrated at the dose being developed in the clinical trials a bone mineral density loss at  weeks of treatment comparable to lupron a gnrh agonist used for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids • compliance benefit obe may have an advantage in patient compliance due to the lack of observed food effect and the ability to be taken once anytime throughout the day as compared to certain of the competitive product candidates which we believe need to be taken on an empty stomach obe nolasiban to improve ivf outcomes we are developing obe nolasiban an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing ivf in europe approximately  ivf treatments were performed in  and in the united states approximately  ivf treatments were performed in  the ivf process has an overall live birth rate of approximately  in the united states and  in europe we inlicensed obe from merck serono which previously completed preclinical studies and phase  clinical trials in  healthy female volunteers that evaluated the safety and pk profile of obe in  we completed our patient phase  clinical trial of obe in women undergoing ivf in this phase  clinical trial obe did not reach the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant increase in pregnancy rate at six weeks after embryo transfer in our posthoc analysis which excluded patients with progesterone levels in the top quartile of the patient pool we identified a statistically significant doseproportional increase in pregnancy rate at  weeks as well as live birth rates we believe that high progesterone levels can lead to a premature closing of the embryo implantation window based on these results we intend to initiate a european phase  clinical trial in women undergoing ivf in the first half of  and expect to report data for the primary endpoint in the second quarter of  obe for the treatment of preterm labor we are developing obe an oral and selective prostaglandin f or pgf receptor antagonist as a once daily treatment for preterm labor in weeks  to  of pregnancy preterm labor defined as the body commencing the birthing process prior to  weeks is characterized by uterine contractions cervical dilation and rupture of the fetal membranes that surround and protect the fetus during pregnancy preterm labor can lead to preterm birth which is currently the leading worldwide cause of death of newborn babies according to the national center for health statistics approximately  of babies in the united states were born preterm in  we inlicensed obe from merck serono in  based on its pk profile and efficacy observed in animal models we believe obe has the potential to become a firstinclass therapy to suppress preterm labor and delay or avoid preterm birth without significant safety concerns for the fetus we are currently conducting a phase  clinical trial assessing the safety tolerability and pk profile of obe in healthy postmenopausal female volunteers after single doses of  mg to  mg and multiple doses between  mg per day and  mg per day over  consecutive days based on preliminary data obe was observed to have a favorable safety profile and to be welltolerated at doses up to  mg after single dose administration and up to  mg per day after multiple dose administration over  days each of which are above the estimated clinical effective dose  we are a swiss stock corporation société anonyme organized under the laws of switzerland we were formed in
