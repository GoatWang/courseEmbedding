delivered lower returns with more volatility q  do you ever have a large cash position in the portfolio a  we will never invest  in one asset class therefore if our model only shows one asset class as a buy then we will hold  in cash for that month q  how many months during the year will the portfolio change a  on average we expect four times a year q  does the portfolio make money every month a  no portfolio can make money every month we anticipate but cannot guarantee that we will make money approximately  months per calendar year q  what stocks do you buy a  we buy the sp  not individual stocks q  why do you buy long term bonds a  we are not holding the bonds until maturity so the length of the bonds is not an issue we are purchasing bonds when we think the price will go up giving us a capital gain along with the interest income q  am i diversified when you buy the sp  a  yes it is a common misconception that holding a lot of mutual funds or stocks gives you diversity in reality all stock mutual funds and stocks behave relatively the same q  why would i want to own gold a  because there are times that gold is the only asset class rising     american asset mgmt   american

be in at any one time at any one time the economy will be in one of the four economic cycles listed above the secret of the strategy is to know when to be invested in a particular asset class and when to avoid a particular asset class using proprietary indicators that we have developed we change our portfolios on the first or last day of every month so that we are invested in the two best asset classes for that month the four asset classes listed above are the only ones you need to own in order to have the opportunity to prosper in all types of markets no matter what economic cycle the country is experiencing one or more of these asset classes may provide a positive return for the year in  while the stock market lost over  percent the bond commodity and cash asset classes all had positive returns we believe the strategy we began using in  would have given you the opportunity to make money in  when the stock market lost over  percent our strategy is based on backtesting of past market data not actual client returns the limitations of backtesting are fully explained in our disclosures this allocation endeavors to provide growth and income while controlling volatility we attempt to prevent you from being subjected to the wild crazy swings in the stock market that cause people to lose their life savings these assets are always present in the portfolio in a balanced way no matter what is going on in the economy they are designed to offset each other so that a majority of the assets in the portfolio might rise no matter which economic cycle the economy is experiencing
