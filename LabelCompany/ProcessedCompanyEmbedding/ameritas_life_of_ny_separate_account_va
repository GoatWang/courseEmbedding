historical fund and portfolio names adding deleting or substituting variable investment options we do not control the subaccounts underlying portfolios so we cannot guarantee that any of the portfolios will always be available we retain the right to change the investments of the separate account and to eliminate the shares of any subaccounts underlying portfolio and substitute shares of another series fund portfolio if the shares of an underlying portfolio are no longer available for investment or if in our judgment investment in the portfolio would be inappropriate in view of the purposes of the separate account we may add new separate account underlying portfolios or eliminate existing underlying portfolios when in our sole discretion conditions warrant a change in all of these situations we will receive any necessary sec and state approval before making any such change our separate account may be i operated as an investment management company or any other form permitted by law ii deregistered with the sec if registration is no longer required or iii combined with one or more other separate accounts to the extent permitted by law we also may transfer assets of the separate account to other accounts where permitted by applicable law we reserve the right to remove combine or add subaccounts subaccounts may be closed to new or subsequent premium payments transfers or premium allocations we will receive any necessary sec and state approval before making any of these changes we will notify you of any changes to the variable investment options resolving material conflicts underlying investment interests in addition to serving as underlying portfolios to the subaccounts the portfolios are available to registered separate accounts of other insurance companies offering variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts we do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the fund companies selling portfolio shares to fund other products however there is a possibility that a material conflict of interest may arise between policy owners and the owners of variable contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one of the portfolios shares of some of the portfolios may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans qualifying under section  of the internal revenue code as a result there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of owners or owners of other contracts including contracts issued by other companies and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans in the event of a material conflict we will take any necessary steps to resolve the matter including removing that portfolio as an underlying investment option of the separate account the board of directors of each fund company will monitor events in order to identify any material conflicts that may arise and determine what action if any should be taken in response to those events or conflicts see the accompanying prospectuses of the portfolios for more information also see the transfers section omnibus orders fixed account investment option there is one fixed interest rate option fixed account where we bear the investment risk we guarantee that you will earn a minimum interest rate that will yield at least  per year compounded annually we may declare a higher current interest rate however you bear the risk that we will not credit more interest than will yield the minimum guaranteed rate per year for the life of the policy we have sole discretion over how assets allocated to the fixed account are invested and we bear the risk that those assets will perform better or worse than the amount of interest we have declared net premiums allocated to and transfers to the fixed account under the policy become part of our general account assets which support annuity and insurance obligations interest in the general account has not been registered with the sec and is not subject to sec regulation nor is the general account registered as an investment company with the sec the general account includes all of our assets except those assets segregated in separate accounts we have sole discretion to invest the assets of the general account subject to applicable law assets in the fixed account are subject to claims by creditors of the company the focus of this prospectus is to disclose the separate account aspects of the policy therefore sec staff have not reviewed the fixed account disclosures in this prospectus transfers the policy is designed for longterm investment not for use with professional market timing services or use with programmed large or frequent transfers excessive transfers could harm other policy owners by having a detrimental effect on investment portfolio management in addition to the right of the portfolios to impose redemption fees on shortterm trading we reserve the right to reject any specific premium allocation or transfer request if in the judgment of a subaccount portfolio fund advisor a subaccount portfolio would be unable to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies or if policy owners would otherwise potentially be adversely affected transferring money out of a subaccount within  days of a purchase may be considered market timing however any portfolio fund adviser may establish its own standards and each transaction may be evaluated on its own ultimately the portfolio fund adviser has the authority to make this determination prior to the annuity date you may transfer policy value from one subaccount to another from the separate account to the fixed account or from the fixed account to any subaccount subject to these rules transfer rules a transfer is considered any single request to move assets from one or more subaccounts or the fixed account to one or more of the other subaccounts or the fixed account we must receive notice of the transfer  either by written notice an authorized telephone transaction or by internet when available transfer requests by facsimile telephone or internet must be sent to us by  pm eastern time for sameday processing requests received later are processed on the next trading day fax requests must be sent to us at if requests are faxed elsewhere we will process them as of the day they are received by our trading unit the transferred amount must be at least  or the entire subaccount or fixed account value if it is less if the value remaining after a transfer will be less than  in a subaccount or  in the fixed account we will include that amount as part of the transfer  if the dollar cost averaging systematic transfer program is used then the minimum transfer amount out of a subaccount or the fixed account is the lesser of  or the balance in the subaccount or fixed account under this program the maximum amount that may be transferred from the fixed account each month is  th of the value of the fixed account at the time the dollar cost averaging program is established while a dollar cost averaging program is in effect elective transfers out of the fixed account are prohibited  the portfolio rebalancing and earnings sweep systematic transfer programs have no minimum transfer limits the first  transfers each policy year are free thereafter transfers may result in a  charge for each transfer this fee is deducted on a prorata basis from balances in all subaccounts and the fixed account it is not subtracted from the amount of the transfer transfers under any systematic transfer program do count toward the  free transfer limit a transfer from the fixed account except made pursuant to a systematic transfer program  may be made only once each policy year  may be delayed up to six months  is limited during any policy year to the greatest of   of the fixed account value on the date of the initial transfer during that year  the greatest amount of any similar transfer out of the fixed account during the previous  months or   we reserve the right to limit transfers or to modify transfer privileges and we reserve the right to change the transfer rules at any time if the policy value in any subaccount falls below  we may transfer the remaining balance without charge proportionately to the remaining investment options you selected in your latest allocation instructions we will notify you when such a transfer occurs you may within  days of the date of our notice reallocate the amount transferred without charge to another investment option in the event you authorize telephone or internet transfers we are not liable for telephone or internet instructions that we in good faith believe you authorized we will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine omnibus orders purchase and redemption orders received by the portfolios generally are omnibus orders from intermediaries such as retirement plans and separate accounts funding variable insurance products the omnibus orders reflect the aggregation and netting of multiple orders from individual retirement plan participants and individual owners of variable insurance products the omnibus nature of these orders may limit the ability of the portfolios to apply their respective disruptive trading policies and procedures we cannot guarantee that the portfolios will not be harmed by transfer activity relating to the retirement plans or other insurance companies that may invest in the portfolios these other insurance companies are responsible for their own policies and procedures regarding frequent transfer activity if their policies and procedures fail to successfully discourage harmful transfer activity it will affect other owners of portfolio shares as well as the owners of all variable life insurance or variable annuity contracts including ours whose variable investment options correspond to the affected portfolios in addition if a portfolio believes that an omnibus order that we submit may reflect one or more transfer requests from owners engaged in disruptive trading the portfolio may reject the entire omnibus order and thereby delay or prevent us from implementing your request disruptive trading procedures the policy is not designed to serve as a vehicle for frequent trading in response to shortterm fluctuations in the market such frequent trading programmed transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of a subaccounts underlying portfolio can disrupt management of a subaccounts underlying portfolio and raise expenses this in turn can hurt performance of an affected subaccount and therefore hurt your policys performance organizations or individuals that use market timing investment strategies and make frequent or other disruptive transfers should not purchase the policy policy owners should be aware that we are contractually obligated to provide policy owner transaction data relating to trading activities to the underlying funds on written request and on receipt of written instructions from a fund to restrict or prohibit further purchases or transfers by policy owners identified by an underlying fund as having engaged in transactions that violate the trading policies of the fund we reserve the right to reject or restrict in our sole discretion transfers initiated by a market timing organization or individual or other party authorized to give transfer instructions we further reserve the right to impose restrictions on transfers that we determine in our sole discretion will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other policy owners restrictions may include changing suspending or terminating telephone online and facsimile transfer privileges we will enforce any subaccount underlying portfolio managers restrictions imposed upon transfers considered by the manager to be disruptive our disruptive trading procedures may vary from subaccount to subaccount and may also vary due to differences in operational systems and contract provisions any subaccount restrictions will be uniformly applied there is no assurance that the measures we take will be effective in preventing market timing or other excessive transfer activity our ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply our disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations the discretionary nature of our disruptive trading procedures may result in some policy owners being able to market time while other policy owners bear the harm associated with timing also because other insurance companies and retirement plans may invest in subaccount underlying portfolios we cannot guarantee that subaccount underlying portfolios will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within contracts issued by them excessive transfers we reserve the right to restrict transfers if we determine you are engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage policy owners in making this determination we will consider among other things the total dollar amount being transferred the number of transfers you make over a period of time whether your transfers follow a pattern designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations particularly within certain subaccount underlying portfolios whether your transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of individual policy owners in the group and the investment objectives andor size of the subaccount underlying portfolio third party traders we reserve the right to restrict transfers by any firm or any other third party authorized to initiate transfers on behalf of multiple policy owners if we determine such third party trader is engaging in a pattern of transfers that may disadvantage policy owners in making this determination we may among other things reject the transfer instructions of any agent acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one policy owner or reject the transfer or exchange instructions of individual policy owners who have executed transfer forms which are submitted by market timing firms or other third parties on behalf of more than one policy owner we will notify affected policy owners before we limit transfers modify transfer procedures or refuse to complete a transfer transfers made pursuant to participation in a dollar cost averaging portfolio rebalancing or earnings sweep program are not subject to these disruptive trading procedures see the section of this prospectus describing those programs for the rules of each program systematic transfer programs we offer several systematic transfer programs we reserve the right to alter or terminate these programs upon thirty days written notice dollar cost averaging the dollar cost averaging program allows you to automatically transfer on a periodic basis a set dollar amount or percentage from the money market subaccount or the fixed account to any other subaccounts or the fixed account requested percentages are converted to a dollar amount you can begin dollar cost averaging when you purchase the policy or later you can increase or decrease the amount or percentage of transfers or discontinue the program at any time dollar cost averaging programs are intended to limit loss and result in the purchase of more accumulation units when a portfolios value is low and fewer units when its value is high however there is no guarantee that such a program will result in a higher policy value protect against a loss

applicants state that replacement portfolios and current portfolios respective investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same a comparison of the investment objectives strategies and risks of the replacement portfolio and the current portfolio is included in the application  the following table compares the fees and expenses of the current portfolio and the

investment advisor cim has contractually agreed to limit direct net annual portfolio operating expenses through april   to  under the terms of the contractual expense limitation operating expenses do not include interest expense brokerage commissions taxes and extraordinary expenses only the board of directors of cvsi may terminate a portfolios expense cap before the contractual period expires the advisor further voluntarily reimbursed expenses of  or  for net operating expenses of  to maintain a positive yield during the year ended december    the applicants state that the proposed substitution is in response to a decision by the board of directors for cvsi at a meeting held on june   to approve the dissolution of the current portfolio on or about november   the “liquidation date” the boards decision to liquidate the current portfolio requires the life insurance companies to transfer accumulated contract value invested in the current portfolio to an alternative investment option available under the contracts on or before the liquidation date currently the only money market portfolio investment option offered under the contracts is the current portfolio accordingly the proposed substitution is necessary in order to provide the contract owners with continued access to a money market portfolio investment option consequently the life insurance companies have determined to replace the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio via the substitution  the life insurance companies submit that the replacement portfolio is an appropriate alternative for contract owners for several reasons first its investment objectives strategies and risks are substantially the same as those of the current portfolio second it is substantially larger than the current portfolio has had lower overall expense levels than the portfolio in recent years and has had higher yields in recent years than the current portfolio third the contracts and other variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the life insurance companies currently offer one or more vipfv portfolios other than the replacement portfolio  the applicants believe that contract owners would benefit from the significantly larger size of the replacement portfolio and the somewhat higher yields of the replacement portfolio as contrasted start printed page with the size and recent yields of the current portfolio the yield for the current portfolio for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the current portfolio was  as of december   the yield for the replacement portfolio initial class shares for the seven days ending december   was  the net asset value of the replacement portfolio supporting initial class shares was  as of december    the applicants believe that contract owners will benefit from the reduction in overall expenses of the replacement portfolio as compared to the current portfolio specifically the management fee other expenses and total operating expenses are less than those of the current portfolio both portfolios have no charge for rule b distribution and services fees the total annual operating expense of the replacement portfolio is less than that of the current portfolio given this decrease the applicants believe that the substitution would benefit contract owners by reducing the overall level of portfolio expenses legal analysis and conditions  the applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitution section c of the  act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is not the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent section c was intended to provide for commission scrutiny of a proposed substitution which could in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the substitute security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring a loss of the sales load deducted from initial premium an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the proceeds of redemption or both as well as possibly suffering adverse tax consequences upon redemption consequently the section was designed to forestall the ability of a depositor to present holders of interest in a unit investment trust with situations in which a holders only choice would be to continue an investment in an unsuitable underlying security or to elect a costly and in effect forced redemption  applicants submit that the proposed substitution will provide contract owners with substantially the same investment vehicle and would not raise any of the aforementioned concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include section c  applicants represent that redemptions and purchases will occur simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times all redemptions of shares of the current portfolio and purchases of shares of the replacement portfolio will be effected in accordance with section c of the act and rule c thereunder the substitution will take place at relative net asset value as of the effective date of the substitution “effective date” with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investments in the money market subaccount of the applicable account  contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio will be transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge contract owners will not incur any additional fees or charges as a result of the substitution nor will their rights or the life insurance companies respective obligations under the contracts be altered in any way and the substitution will not change contract owners insurance benefits under the contracts all expenses incurred in connection with the substitution including legal accounting transactional and other fees and expenses including brokerage commissions will be paid by the life insurance companies in addition the substitution will not impose any tax liability on contract owners  the applicants also represent that the substitution will not cause the contract fees and charges currently paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the substitution than before the substitution the life insurance companies will not exercise any right they may have under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers under the contracts for the period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice defined below through at least thirty  days following the effective date  existing contract owners will be notified of the proposed substitution by means of a prospectus or prospectus supplement for each of the contracts “presubstitution notice” at least thirty  days before the effective date new purchasers of the contracts will be provided the presubstitution notice the contract prospectus and the prospectus for the replacement portfolio in accordance with all applicable legal requirements  the presubstitution notice will i state that the applicants filed the application seeking approval of the substitution ii set forth the anticipated effective date iii explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio would be attributable to the replacement portfolio as of the effective date iv state that from the date of the presubstitution notice until the effective date contract owners are permitted

limitations and fees that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the contract v advise contract owners that any contract value remaining in the current portfolio subaccount on the effective date will be transferred to a subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio and that the substitution will take place at relative net asset value vi inform contract owners that for at least thirty  days following the effective date the applicable life insurance company will permit contract owners to make transfers of contract value out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio to any other available subaccounts offered under their contracts without the transfer being counted as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees if any that would otherwise be applicable under the terms of the contracts and vii inform contract owners that except as described in the market timing limitations section of the relevant prospectus the applicable life insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of the subaccount investing in the replacement portfolio for at least thirty  days after the effective date  all contract owners will have received a copy of the most recent prospectus for the replacement portfolio prior to the substitution in addition within five  days following the substitution contract owners affected by the substitution will be notified in writing that the substitution was carried out this notice will restate the relevant information set forth in the presubstitution notice and will also explain that the contract values attributable to investments in the current portfolio were transferred to the replacement portfolio without charge start printed page including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge  the applicants represent that the life insurance companies will not receive for three  years after the effective date any direct or indirect benefits from the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates in connection with assets attributable to the contracts affected by the substitution at a higher rate than the life insurance companies had received from the current portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates including without limitation b fees revenue sharing or other arrangements the applicants further represent that the substitution and the selection of the replacement portfolio were not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to a life insurance company or its affiliates by the replacement portfolio its advisor or underwriter or their affiliates  applicants submit that the replacement of the current portfolio with the replacement portfolio is consistent with the protection of contract owners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and thus meets the standards necessary to support an order pursuant to section c of the  act in addition the applicants submit that the proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission and its staff have applied to substitutions that have been approved in the past conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above in the application the applicants believe that the requested order meets the standards set forth in section c of the  act and should therefore be granted start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority

should consult a competent tax advisor no attempt is made to consider any applicable state tax or other tax laws or to address any federal estate or state and local estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of distributions under a policy this discussion of federal income tax consideration relating to the policy is based upon our understanding of laws as they now exist and are currently interpreted by the internal revenue service irs when you invest in an annuity contract you usually do not pay taxes on your investment gains until you withdraw the money  generally for retirement purposes if you invest money generally on a pretax basis in an annuity as part of a pension or retirement plan that is subject to requirements and may have additional benefits under the internal revenue code beyond those generally applicable to annuities eg qualified plan such as iras tsas and the like your contract is called a qualified policy other annuities in which already taxed money is invested other than as part of a qualified plan which can accept aftertax deposits are referred to as a nonqualified policy the tax rules applicable to qualified policies vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan  taxation of nonqualified policies if a nonnatural person eg a corporation or a trust owns a nonqualified policy the taxpayer generally must include in income any increase in the excess of the policy value over the investment in the policy generally the premiums paid for the policy during the taxable year there are some exceptions to this rule and a prospective owner that is not a natural person should discuss these with a tax adviser the following discussion generally applies to policies owned by natural persons o withdrawals when a withdrawal from a nonqualified policy occurs the amount received will be treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to an amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the owners investment in the policy generally the premiums paid for the policy reduced by any amount previously distributed from the policy that was not subject to tax at that time in the case of a surrender under a nonqualified policy the amount received generally will be taxable only to the extent it exceeds the owners investment in the policy o penalty tax on certain withdrawals in the case of a distribution from a nonqualified policy there may be imposed a federal tax penalty equal to  of the amount treated as income in general however there is no penalty on distributions  made on or after the taxpayer reaches age    made on or after an owners death  attributable to the taxpayers becoming disabled or  made as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer other exceptions may be applicable under certain circumstances and special rules may be applicable in connection with the exceptions enumerated above you should consult a tax adviser with regard to exceptions from the penalty tax o annuity payments although tax consequences may vary depending on the payout option elected under an annuity contract a portion of each annuity payment is generally not taxed and the remainder is taxed as ordinary income the nontaxable portion of an annuity payment is generally determined in a manner that is designed to allow you to recover your investment in the policy ratably on a taxfree basis over the expected stream of annuity payments as determined when annuity payments start once your investment in the policy has been fully recovered however the full amount of each annuity payment is subject to tax as ordinary income o taxation of death benefit proceeds amounts may be distributed from the policy because of your death or the death of the annuitant generally such amounts are includible in the income of the recipient as follows i if distributed

transfer assignment or exchange should consult a tax advisor as to the tax consequences o withholding annuity distributions are generally subject to withholding for the recipients federal income tax liability recipients can generally elect however not to have tax withheld from distributions o withholding for nonresident alien owners generally the amount of any payment of interest to a nonresident alien of the united states shall be subject to withholding of a tax equal to  of such amount or if applicable a lower treaty rate a payment may not be subject to withholding where the recipient sufficiently establishes that such payment is effectively connected to the recipients conduct of a trade or business in the united states and such payment is included in the recipients gross income o multiple policies all nonqualified deferred annuity contracts that are issued by us or our affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the amount of gain includable in such owners income when a taxable distribution occurs o further information we believe that the policy qualifies as an annuity contract for federal income

qualified policies the tax rules applicable to qualified policies vary according to the type of retirement plan and the terms and conditions of the plan your rights under a qualified policy may be

transactions with respect to the policy comply with the law also you may wish to consult a tax andor financial adviser regarding the use of the policy within a qualified or other retirement plan since

in each of the next three tax years however an individual who makes a conversion prior to january   can elect to include the full taxable conversion amount in income for  this election is made on irs form  by the individual and cannot be made or changed after the due date including extensions for filing the  federal income tax return if a taxpayer dies before the end of the year spread the taxable portion of the conversion amount which has not been included in income will generally be taxable in the year of the taxpayers death however if the sole beneficiary of the roth ira is the surviving spouse he or she can elect to continue the year spread in addition if the year spread rule is utilized for  conversions any distributions of amounts subject to the year spread occurring before  will require acceleration of income inclusion as explained in the section which follows on taxability of roth ira distributions see part iii j amounts properly converted from a nonroth ira to a roth ira are generally not subject to the  early withdrawal penalty however if you make a conversion to a roth ira but keep part of the money for any reason that amount will be taxable in the year distributed from the nonroth ira and the taxable portion may be subject to the  early withdrawal penalty in addition under  technical corrections if an amount allocable to a conversion contribution is distributed from the roth ira during the year period beginning with the first day of the individuals taxable year in which the conversion contribution was made it will be subject to a percent premature distribution penalty tax but only to the extent the conversion amount distributed was includable in gross income as a result of the conversion you should consult with your tax advisor to ensure that you receive the tax benefits you desire before you contribute to a roth ira convert to a roth ira or take distributions from a roth ira it will also be important for you to keep track of and report

recharacterization a trusteetotrustee transfer from the first ira to the second ira must be made on or before the due date including extensions for filing the individuals federal income tax return for the taxable year for which the contribution was made to the first ira however in announcement  the irs has indicated that a calendar year taxpayer that has timely filed his  federal income tax return can elect to recharacterize a  ira contribution including a roth ira conversion provided appropriate corrective action is taken by december   for the  tax year the deadline is currently october   see form  instructions appropriate corrective action may include notifying the trustee or issuer having the trustee or issuer actually making the transfer or account redesignation and filing an amended  or  as appropriate federal income tax return to reflect the recharacterization for  the corrected return must be filed by april   any net income attributable to the recharacterized contribution must also be transferred to the second ira once the transfer is made the election is irrevocable the effect of recharacterizing a contribution is that it is treated as having been originally contributed to the second ira on the same date and in the case of a regular contribution for the same taxable year that the contribution was made to the first ira if you elect to recharacterize a contribution you must report the recharacterization and treat the contribution as having been made to the second ira instead of the first on your federal income tax return examples of where a recharacterization election might be useful or desired include where an individual discovers he was ineligible to convert a regular ira to a roth ira because his adjusted gross income exceeded  amounts were erroneously rolled over from a traditional ira to a simple ira or an individual decides after he has made a contribution to a regular ira for a tax year that he is eligible for and prefers to contribute to a roth ira or vice versa recharacterizations are not permitted where a deduction has been taken for the contribution to the first ira the contribution to the first ira was the result of a taxfree transfer or the original contribution was an employer contribution to a simple or sep ira reconversion rules for taxable years after  if you convert a nonroth ira to a roth ira and then recharacterize it back to a nonroth ira you are not permitted by irs rules to reconvert the amount from the nonroth ira back to a roth ira before the beginning of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the amount was converted to a roth ira or if later the end of the day period beginning on the day on which you recharacterized the roth ira to a nonroth ira this rule will apply even if you were not eligible to make the original conversion because of your agi or tax filing status if you attempt a reconversion prior to the time permitted it will be treated as a failed conversion the remedy for a failed conversion is recharacterization to a nonroth ira if the failed conversion is not corrected it will be treated as a regular contribution to a roth ira and thus may be an excess contribution subject to a  excise tax for each tax year it remains in the roth ira to the extent it exceeds the maximum regular roth ira contribution permitted for the tax year see part iii g excess contributions below also the failed conversion will be subject to the  premature distribution penalty tax unless corrected or an exception to that tax applies consult with your tax advisor before attempting a reconversion g excess contributions there is a  irs penalty tax on ira contributions made in excess of permissible contribution limits however excess contributions made in one year may be applied against the contribution limits in a later year if the contributions in the later year are less than the limit this penalty tax can be avoided if the excess amount together with any earnings on it is returned to you before the due date of your tax return for the year for which the excess amount was contributed any earnings so distributed will be taxable in the year for which the contribution was made and may be subject to the  premature distribution penalty tax see part iii premature ira distributions the  excess contribution penalty tax will apply to each year the excess amount remains in the ira plan until it is removed either by having it returned to you or by making a reduced contribution in a subsequent year to the extent an excess contribution is absorbed in a subsequent year by contributing less than the maximum deduction allowable for that year the amount absorbed will be deductible in the year applied provided you are eligible to take a deduction if a taxpayer transfers amounts contributed for a tax year to a regular ira and any earnings allocated to such amounts to a roth ira by the due date for filing the return for such tax year including extensions the amounts are not included in the taxpayers gross income to the extent that no deduction was allowed for the contribution see part iii f recharacterization of ira and roth ira contributions above excess contributions to a roth ira if you are ineligible and convert a regular ira to a roth ira all or a part of the amount you convert may be an excess contribution examples may include conversions made when your roth agi exceeds  or because you fail to timely make the rollover contribution from the regular ira to the roth ira in tax years after  you may also have an excess contribution if your conversion is a failed conversion that is not timely corrected falic overture acclaim   b   pnath�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th you will have an excess contribution if the ineligible amounts you convert and the contributions you make to all your iras for the tax year exceed your ira contribution limits for the year to avoid the  excise tax on excess contributions you must withdraw the excess contributions plus earnings before the due date of your tax return plus extensions or recharacterize the contribution if permitted see part iii f recharacterization of ira and roth ira contributions above h loans and prohibited transactions you may not borrow from your ira plan including roth iras or pledge it as security for a loan a loan would disqualify your entire ira plan and its full value or taxable portions of your roth ira or nondeductible regular ira would be includable in your taxable income in the year of violation this amount would also be subject to the  penalty tax on premature distributions your ira plan will similarly be disqualified if you or your beneficiary engage in any transaction prohibited by section  of the internal revenue code a pledge of your ira as security for a loan will cause a constructive distribution of the portion pledged and also be subject to the  penalty tax i taxability of regular ira distributions any cash distribution from your ira plan other than a roth ira is normally taxable as ordinary income all iras of an individual are treated as one contract all distributions during a taxable year are treated as one distribution and the value of the contract income on the contract and investment in the contract is computed as of the close of the calendar year with or within which the taxable year ends if an individual withdraws an amount from an ira during a taxable year and the individual has previously made both deductible and nondeductible ira contributions the amount excludable from income for the taxable year is the portion of the amount withdrawn which bears the same ratio to the amount withdrawn for the taxable year as the individuals aggregate nondeductible ira contributions bear to the balance of all iras of the individual j taxability of roth ira distributions qualified distributions from a roth ira are not included in the taxpayers gross income and are not subject to the additional ten percent  early withdrawal penalty tax to be a qualified distribution the distribution must satisfy a fiveyear holding period and meet one of the following four requirements  be made on or after the date on which the individual attains age   be made to a beneficiary or the individuals estate on or after the individuals death  be attributable to the individual being disabled or  be a distribution to pay for a qualified firsttime home purchase up to a lifetime limit of  the fiveyear holding period for escaping inclusion in income begins with the first day of the tax year in which any contribution including a conversion from a regular ira is made to a roth ira of the taxpayer if the roth ira owner dies this taxableyear period is not redetermined for the roth ira while it is held in the name of a beneficiary or a surviving spouse who treats the decedents roth ira as his or her own however a surviving spouse who treats the roth ira as his or her own must receive any distributions as coming from the surviving spouses own roth ira thus it cannot be treated as being received by a beneficiary on or after the owners death for purposes of determining whether the distribution is a qualified distribution if a distribution from a roth ira is not a qualified distribution and it includes amounts allocable to earnings the earnings distributed are includable in taxable income and may be subject to the  premature distribution penalty if the taxpayer is under age   also the  premature distribution penalty tax may apply to conversion amounts distributed even though they are not includable in income if the distribution is made within the taxableyear period beginning on the first day of the individuals taxable year in which the conversion contribution was made only the portion of the conversion includable in income as a result of the conversion would be subject to the penalty tax under this rule the taxableyear period for this purpose is determined separately for each conversion contribution and may not be the same as the taxableyear period used to determine whether a distribution from a roth ira is a qualified distribution or not for this reason it is important that you keep track of when your conversion contributions are made to your roth ira see part iii l premature ira distributions unlike regular iras distributions from roth iras come first from regular contributions then converted amounts on a firstin firstout basis and last from earnings any distributions made before  which are attributable to  conversion contributions for which the year incometax spread is being utilized will result in an acceleration of taxable income in the year of distribution up to the amount of the distribution allocable to the  conversion this amount is in addition to the amount otherwise includable in gross income for that taxable year as a result of the conversion but not in excess of the amount required to be included over the year period this tax treatment would likewise apply in the case of distributions made by a surviving spouse who elects to continue the year spread on death of the original owner of the roth ira generally all roth iras both regular roth iras and roth conversion iras must be treated as one for purposes of determining the taxation of distributions however if a roth ira is held by an individual as beneficiary of a deceased roth ira owner the taxableyear period used to determine whether distributions are qualified or not is determined independently of the yeartaxable period for the beneficiarys own roth iras however if a surviving spouse elects to treat the roth ira as his or her own the yeartaxable period for all of the surviving spouses roth iras is the earlier of the end of either the taxableyear period for the decedent or that applicable to the surviving spouses own roth iras the rules for taxing nonqualified distributions and premature distributions of conversion amounts from a roth ira are complex to

current annualized yield for a day period for a subaccount the annualized yield of a subaccount refers to the income generated by the ssubaccount over a specified day period because this yield is annualized the yield generated by a subaccount during the day period is assumed to be generated each day period the yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day of the period according to the following formula yielda  b     cd where anet investment income earned during the period by the portfolio company attributable to shares owned by the subaccount bexpenses accrued for the period net of reimbursements cthe average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during the period and dthe maximum

for long term investment so does not reflect any withdrawal charge the yield does not include charges for any optional feature because of the charges and deductions imposed by the separate account the yield for a subaccount will be lower than the yield for the corresponding series fund portfolio the yield on amounts held in the subaccount normally will fluctuate over time therefore the disclosed

preexisting policy having a balance of one accumulation unit at the beginning of the base period subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting those policy deductions stated above and dividing the net change in policy value by the value of the policy at the beginning of the period to obtain a base period return and multiplying the base period return by  the ameritas money market subaccounts

generally determined on a lastin firstout basis meaning taxable income is withdrawn before the policys cost basis is withdrawn for policies issued in connection with nonqualified plans the cost basis is generally the premiums while for contracts issued in connection with qualified plans there may be no cost basis the taxable portion of a withdrawal is taxed at ordinary income tax rates tax penalties may also apply for annuity payments a portion of each payment in excess of an exclusion amount is includable in taxable income the exclusion amount for payments based on a fixed annuity income option is determined by multiplying the payment by the ratio that the cost basis of the policy adjusted for any period certain or refund feature bears to the expected return under the policy payments received after the investment in the policy has been recovered ie when the total of the excludable amounts equals the investment in the policy are fully taxable the taxable portion is taxed

from a contract for eligible rollover distributions from policies issued under certain types of qualified plans  of the distribution must be withheld unless the payee elects to have the distribution rolled over to another eligible plan in a direct transfer this requirement is mandatory and cannot be waived by the owner an eligible rollover distribution is the estimated taxable portion of any amount received by a covered employee from a plan qualified under section a or a of the code or from a tax sheltered annuity qualified under section b of the code other than  a series of substantially equal annuity payments for the life or life expectancy of the employee or joint lives or joint life expectancies of the employee and his or her designated beneficiary or for a specified period of ten years or more  minimum distributions required to be made under the code and  hardship withdrawals failure to rollover the entire amount of an eligible rollover distribution including an amount equal to the  portion of the distribution that was withheld could have adverse tax consequences including the imposition of a penalty tax on premature withdrawals described later in this section withdrawals or distributions from a policy other than eligible rollover distributions are also subject to withholding on the estimated taxable portion of the distribution but the owner may elect in such cases to waive the withholding requirement if not waived withholding is imposed  for periodic payments at the rate that would be imposed if the payments were wages or  for other distributions at the rate of

of the code provides that in order for a variable annuity policy based on a segregated asset account to qualify as an annuity contract under the code the investments made by such policy must be adequately diversified the treasury regulations issued under section h treas reg  apply a diversification requirement to each of the subaccounts of the separate account the separate account through

requires the series funds and their portfolios to comply with the treasury regulations owner control the treasury department has indicated that the diversification regulations do not provide guidance regarding the circumstances in which policy owner control of the investments of the separate account will cause the policy owner to be treated as the owner of the assets of the separate account thereby resulting in the loss of favorable tax treatment of the policy at this time it cannot be determined whether additional guidance will be provided and what standards may be contained in such guidance the amount of owner control which may be exercised under the policy is different in some respects from the situations addressed in published rulings issued by the internal revenue service in which it was held that the policy owner was not the owner of the assets of the separate account it is unknown whether these differences such as the owners ability to transfer among investment choices or the number and type of investment choices available would cause the owner to be considered as the owner of the assets of the separate account resulting in the imposition of federal income tax to the owner with respect to earnings allocable to the contract prior to receipt of payments under the policy due to the uncertainty in this area we reserve the right to modify the policy in an attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment multiple contracts the code provides that multiple annuity contracts which are issued within a calendar year to the same contract owner by one company or its affiliates are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the tax consequences of any distribution such treatment may result in adverse tax consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed amounts from such multiple contracts for purposes of this rule contracts received in a section  exchange will be considered issued in the year of the exchange owners should consult a tax adviser prior to purchasing more than one annuity contract in any calendar year partial  exchanges section  of the code provides that an annuity contract may be exchanged in a taxfree transaction for another annuity contract the internal revenue service has stated that it will challenge transactions where taxpayers enter into a series of partial exchanges and annuitizations as part of a design to avoid application of the  premature distribution penalty or other limitations imposed on annuity contracts under the code in the absence of further guidance from the internal revenue service it is unclear what specific types of partial exchange designs and transactions will be challenged by the internal revenue service due to the uncertainty in this area owners should consult their own tax advisers prior to entering into a partial exchange of an annuity contract contracts owned by other than natural persons under section u of the code the investment earnings on policy

decide to combine or eliminate subaccounts or transfer assets to and from subaccounts  the basic contract features may be modified or augmented by a number of “rider options” the rider options permit contract owners to elect certain contract features or benefits that fit their particular needs generally the election of a particular rider option will result in higher explicit expenses for ameritasfirst ameritas or an increased risk that charges associated with the contract will be inadequate in relation to expenses thus most of the rider options once elected result in increased charges over and above the basic charges  for medley contracts and  for accent contracts  rider options must be chosen at the time of application available rider options for medley contracts include a minimum initial premium option a sevenyear or fiveyear cdsc option two “free” withdrawal options a oneyear step up death benefit a  enhanced death benefit and a greater of oneyear stepup or  enhanced death

options oneyear “periodic stepup” “ rollup” and “greater of” features are available at annual rates of   and  respectively  for accent contracts the only rider option available is a oneyear “periodic stepup” minimum death benefit at a current annual rate of  of separate account assets  ameritasfirst ameritas intend to offer an additional rider option under the contracts which if elected at the time of application will result in the crediting of a  bonus the “credit” on all purchase payments made during the first twelve months of the contract the credit on the contract owners remitted purchase payments will be funded from the ameritas or first ameritas general account and will be credited proportionately among the investment options chosen by the contract owner in contract years two through nine ameritasfirst ameritas will credit a lesser bonus amount the amount of the credit in years two through nine will be equal to  multiplied by a linearly decreasing ratio over the nineyear surrender charge period the following schedule illustrates the decreasing bonus amount credited on premiums paid in years two through nine yearformulareduced bonus percent ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×  ×   for the above rider option an annualized fee of  of the daily net assets of the separate account or of the fixed account if elected will be deducted monthly for the first nine contract years the option of either electing the credit or not an election that can only be made prior to issuance of the contract allows prospective purchasers to choose between two different separate account charge structures over the first nine contract years if the credit is elected total separate account charges under the contracts as an annual percentage of the average daily net assets of the respective separate accounts for the first nine contract years and assuming no other rider options are elected will be  for the medley contract and  for the accent contracts if the credit is not elected total separate account charges for medley and accent contracts will be  and  respectively for all contract years assuming no other rider options are elected if the owner expects to surrender the contract in the first seven contract years the credit should not be elected because in that event he or she will receive a benefit from the credit that is smaller than the charges paid for it an owner who holds the contract for start printed page at least seven years will always benefit from having elected the credit  the contract has a “free look” period which will vary according to state law but will be at least ten days depending on the laws of the state in which the contract is issued the amount of the refund will be equal to i the value of the contract ii the purchase payments or iii the greater of the previous two values the credit as augmented by any earnings on the credit or as diminished by any investment losses on the credit will not be part of the amount an owner will receive if the free look provision is exercised unless the law requires that the full amount of the purchase payments be refunded the owner bears the investment risk from the time of purchase until he or she returns the contract the refund amount may be more or less than the purchase payments the owner made except in states requiring return of premiums  the contracts have a contingent deferred sales charge “cdsc” that applies to partial withdrawals within nine years of a premium payment surrender within nine years of a premium payment annuitization within two years of a premium payment or annuitization pursuant to an income option with no life contingency within nine years of a premium payment  the contracts assess a cdsc of  of invested premium payments in the first three years after the premium is paid thereafter the cdsc declines to  in years four and five to    and  for years six through nine respectively and is  for years ten or more  if a credit has been elected a portion of the credit as augmented by earnings or diminished by any investment losses the “credit value” will be subject to recapture upon an exercise of free look rights and all withdrawals and annuitizations from the “account value” the sum of the values in the separate account variable investment options and the fixed account during the first seven years of the contracts the amount of the credit value withdrawn is the total withdrawn from the account value times the ratio of the credit value to the account value during the free look period and before the end of the seventh contract year portions of the credit value withdrawn will be recaptured according to the following formula cvr  cvav  s  y where cvr  credit value recaptured cv credit value immediately before the withdrawal av  account value immediately before the withdrawal s  excess of the amount withdrawn over any amount permitted to be withdrawn with no cdsc pursuant to an optional rider y  −contract year of surrender for withdrawals in contract years one through four  of the accent contracts factor y would be capped at no more than  in order to comply with new york law  the effect of the above formula for the contracts other than accent contracts in their first  contract years is that the portion of the withdrawn credit value to be recaptured during the first seven years will be reduced during each of the first seven contract years in the first contract year one hundred percent  of the credit value will be recaptured in each of years two through seven the portion of the withdrawn credit value that is recaptured will be reduced by oneninth no recapture will take place after the seventh contract year the effect of the formula for the accent contracts is that the portion of the withdrawn credit value to be recaptured will remain level during the first four contract years when y will always be  and then will be reduced by oneninth during each of contract years   applicants state that the total dollar amount of the surrender charge plus recapture of the credit value will not exceed that percentage of premium stated below during the first seven years after a premium payment age in years of premium paymentmaximum percentage of premium  the credit value will not be subject to recapture on the amount contained in a free withdrawal not subject to the cdsc such free withdrawals would only be permitted if the owner had elected an optional free withdrawal rider prior to issuance of the contract for purposes of calculating the cdsc surrenders are considered to first come from the oldest purchase payment made to the contract then the next oldest purchase payment and so forth  the credit value recaptured will be taken proportionately from each investment option as allocated at the time of the withdrawal no recapture of the credit value will take place if the contract is annuitized and applied to a life contingent income option assuming no premiums paid for two years prior to annuitization if a death benefit becomes payable or if distributions are required in order to meet minimum distributions requirements under the code  after the end of the seventh contract year the credit will not be subject to recapture and after the ninth year the  charge associated with the credit will be eliminated  if the contract owner elects the credit option and later makes a full surrender of the contract electing the credit option will be to the contract owners benefit only if the contract is not surrendered during the first seven contract years if the contract is surrendered during the first seven contract years the contract owner will receive less than if the credit option had not been elected after seven contract years and during contract years  for the accent contracts both the account value and the surrender value received upon full surrender of the contract will be greater if the credit option is elected than if it had not been elected  the sevenyear or fiveyear cdsc option is not available if the contract owner elects the credit option  applicants seek exemptions pursuant to section c from sections a and ia of the act and rule  thereunder to the extent deemed necessary to permit ameritasfirst ameritas to recapture part or all of the credits and earnings on the credits as described above in the following instances i when an owner exercises the contracts free look provision and ii when an owner makes a partial withdrawal or a surrender in the first seven contract years applicants legal analysis  section c of the act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the act and the rules promulgated thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act granting the exemptions requested below with respect to the contracts and any future contracts funded by the accounts or other accounts that are issued by ameritasfirst ameritas and underwritten or distributed by the broker or affiliated brokerdealers applicants undertake that future contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts applicants believe that the requested start printed page exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  subsection i of section  of the act provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account funding variable insurance contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of the subsection paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for such a separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a contract funded by the registered separate account unless such contract is a redeemable security section a defines “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of the which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  applicants submit that the recapture of the credit in the circumstances set forth in the application would not deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the issuers current net assets applicants state that an owners interest in the credit allocated to his or her annuity account during the first seven years is not entirely vested until after the seventh year subsequent credits in years eight and nine vest immediately unless and until any credit amount is vested applicants submit that ameritasfirst ameritas retains the right and interest in the credit applicants argue that when ameritasfirst ameritas recaptures any credit it is merely retrieving its own assets and the owner has not been deprived of a proportionate share of the applicable separate accounts assets because his or her interest in the credit amount has not vested  in addition applicants state that permitting an owner to retain a credit under a contract upon the exercise of the free look provision would not only be unfair but would also encourage individuals to purchase a contract with no intention of keeping it and return it for a quick profit furthermore the recapture of the credit within the first seven contract years is designed to provide ameritasfirst ameritas with a measure of protection against a contract owner surrendering or making a partial withdrawal shortly after a credit is made thereby leaving ameritasfirst ameritas insufficient time to recover the cost of the credit the credit value recaptured will be reduced by oneninth over the first seven years of the contract unless the contract at issue is an accent contract where in the first four contract years factor y as explained above will be capped at  to comply with new york law  applicants represent that it is not administratively feasible to track the credit in the separate accounts once it has been declared accordingly the assetbased charges applicable to the separate accounts will be assessed against the entire amount held in the separate account including the credit during the free look period and the recapture periods as a result during such periods the aggregate assetbased charges assessed against an owners contract value will be higher than if no credit had been added ameritasfirst ameritas nonetheless represent that the contracts fees and charges in the aggregate are reasonable within the meaning of section f of the  act  applicants submit that the provisions for recapture of any credit under the contracts do not violate sections a and ia of the act applicants believe that a contrary conclusion would be inconsistent with a stated purpose of the national securities markets improvement act of  “nsmia” which was to amend the act to “provide more effective and less burdensome regulation” sections f and i were added to the act to implement the purposes of nsmia and congressional intent applicants state that the application of credits under the contracts should not raise any questions about ameritasfirst ameritass compliance with the provisions of section i however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants request an exemption from section a and ia to the extent deemed necessary to permit the recapture of any credit under the circumstances described in the application without the loss of the relief from section  provided by section i  section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company to accomplish the same purposes as contemplated by section a rule c under the act prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  it is possible that someone might view ameritasfirst ameritass recapture of the credit as resulting in the redemption of redeemable securities for a price other than one based on the current net asset value of the account applicants believe however that the recapture of the credit does not violate rule c applicants argue that the recapture of all or part of the credit does not involve either of the evils that rule c was intended to eliminate or reduce as far as reasonably practicable namely i the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their sale at a price below net asset value or repurchase at a price above it and ii other unfair results including speculative trading practices these evils were the result of backward pricing the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day backward pricing allowed investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price thereby diluting the values of outstanding mutual fund shares applicants submit that the proposed recapture of the credit does not pose such a threat of dilution to effect a recapture of a credit ameritasfirst ameritas will redeem interests in a contract at a price determined on the basis of the current accumulation unit values of the subaccounts to which the owners contract value is allocated the amount recaptured will approximate the amount of the credits that ameritasfirst ameritas paid out of its general account assets reduced over the seven year surrender period as augmented or reduced by investment results thus no dilution will occur upon the recapture of the credit applicants also submit that the second harm that rule c was designed to address namely speculative trading practices calculated to take advantage of backward pricing will not occur as a result of the recapture of the credit because neither of the harms that rule c was meant to address is found in the recapture of the credit rule c should not apply to any credit however to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants request an exemption from the provisions of rule c to the start printed page extent deemed necessary to permit them to recapture the credit under the contracts conclusion applicants submit that their request for an order is appropriate in the public interest applicants state that such an order would promote competitiveness in the variable annuity market by eliminating the need to file redundant exemptive applications thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of applicants resources applicants argue that investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection by requiring applicants to repeatedly seek exemptive relief that would present no issue under the act that has not already been addressed in the application applicants submit that having them file additional applications would impair their ability to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise further applicants state that if they were required repeatedly to seek exemptive relief with respect to the same issues addressed in the application investors would not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby applicants further submit for the reasons stated herein that their exemptive requests meet the standards set out in section c of the  act namely that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and that therefore the commission should grant the requested order start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority margaret h
