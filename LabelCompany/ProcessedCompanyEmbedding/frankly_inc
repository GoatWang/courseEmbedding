vaccine and leptospira pomona bacterin hereinafter ibrlepto manufactured by franklin laboratories inc franklin a subsidiary of defendant american home products corporation infectious bovine rhinotracheitis is an acute contagious viral infection of cattle characterized by inflammation of the upper respiratory tract it is also known as red nose because a common symptom is a crusted nose the disease was first identified in colorado in the early s a dr mckercer of the university of california succeeded in attenuating a live ibr virus based upon his technique cutter laboratories began manufacturing a vaccine franklin in turn entered into a licensing agreement with cutter laboratories and started manufacturing an ibr vaccine and lepto pomona bacterin in a combination product in  franklin produces approximately two million doses a year of the ibr vaccine the vaccine purchased by plaintiffs and that used by the other farmers and ranchers whose herds suffered post vaccinal reactions came from a unit of production denominated serial  from this unit of production  doses of serial a and  doses of serial b were produced and distributed throughout the united states the only difference between the two subserial numbers was the fact that the subserial a was bottled in dose vials and the subserial b in dose vials three thousand eight hundred seventyfive doses of serial b ibrlepto were distributed by retail stores in bison lemmon and mclaughlin south dakota in april and may of  plaintiff fried lives some nine miles northeast of bison south dakota on may  and may   he purchased  doses of the ibrlepto vaccine from bison grain company on may   he vaccinated his cows with the vaccine prior to being vaccinated the cattle were apparently healthy and in good condition after being vaccinated the cattle were divided into two herds and placed in separate pastures approximately two weeks later plaintiff fried observed that some cattle in both herds were sick the sick animals were gaunt had a yellowish discharge from their eyes were off feed dehydrated and lethargic had a discharge from the nose and suffered from black diarrhea the sick animals appeared to be running a high temperature as was evidenced by their peeling noses plaintiff fried notified bison grain company of the sick animals and then called his veterinarian in all six yearling heifers fourteen cows and one calf became ill one yearling heifer and one calf died the other nineteen head eventually recovered plaintiff pearson lives  miles southeast of lemmon south dakota on june   he bought approximately  doses of the ibrlepto vaccine from smiths drug in lemmon south dakota on june   he vaccinated  cows with the vaccine prior to being vaccinated the cows had been grazing in two separate pastures approximately five miles apart and appeared to be in good condition after being vaccinated the cows were returned to their separate pastures approximately two weeks later plaintiff pearson observed that some of the cows in the home pasture were sick he went immediately to the other pasture and observed the same problem in that herd the sick cattle were suffering from a high fever had red dry cracked noses had yellowish sunken eyes and were suffering badly from diarrhea all  cows became ill thirtyfive of them became much sicker than the rest and of these three died plaintiff van slooten lives  miles south of keldron south dakota on may   he bought  doses of the ibrlepto vaccine from smiths drug in lemmon on may   he vaccinated  cows prior to being vaccinated the cows were in good condition and appeared to be free from disease after being vaccinated the cattle were divided into two herds and placed in pastures a mile and a quarter apart on june   plaintiff van slooten discovered a dead cow near his stock dam and observed that a number of cows were suffering from black diarrhea and had red dry cracked noses and yellow eyes most of the cattle were sick fortysix head were sicker than the rest two cows and two yearling heifers died nearly all of the calves were sick and  calves died plaintiff schuh lives  miles south of mcintosh south dakota on may   he purchased  doses of the ibrlepto vaccine from matterns store in mcintosh south dakota on may   he vaccinated  cows with the vaccine prior to being vaccinated the cattle were in good condition and apparently healthy on june   plaintiff schuh observed that some of the cows appeared to be sick they were gaunt suffering from diarrhea and had dry scabby runny noses and sunken yellowish eyes in all fiftyseven cows became ill of these ten cows died along with three calves in addition to the postvaccinal sicknesses in the herds owned by the four plaintiffs it was developed at trial that similar symptoms were observed in a herd near prairie city south dakota a herd near meadow south dakota a herd near white river south dakota a herd near bison south dakota a herd near isabel south dakota and in five herds in the esmond north dakota area all of these herds had been vaccinated with franklins ibrlepto b vaccine according to defendants evidence franklin received complaints of sick animals following vaccination with serial b from the northwest south dakota area one complaint from white river south dakota a complaint from a veterinarian in north dakota and one complaint from nebraska only a fraction of the cattle in each herd became sick and some of the sick cattle had not been vaccinated with the vaccine dr david reed a virologist and associate professor of veterinary science at south dakota state university testified that ibr is caused by a herpes virus and that it takes some five or six different forms some of the clinical signs of ibr in cattle are a high fever crusted and runny nose and runny eyes he testified that bovine virus diarrhea bvd is a virus disease that has clinical symptoms similar to those in an animal suffering from ibr he testified further that the use of an improperly attenuated ibr vaccine on stressed animals such as those brought in from a pasture and run through a chute and vaccinated could result in the incidence of ibr in any one of its five or six forms dr reed conducted virus isolation tests on tissues from an animal from plaintiff pearsons herd and isolated ibr virus from a pool of intestines and spleen he also conducted virus isolation tests on tissues from animals from the fried van slooten and schuh herds but detected no viral agents in response to a hypothetical question based upon the clinical symptoms observed in plaintiffs herds and the other herds in the area that became ill after being vaccinated with serial b dr reed testified that in his opinion the vaccine was the cause of the sickness and death that followed its use he explained that the reason not all of the animals in the herds became ill following vaccination was that only a percentage of the animals in each herd would be susceptible to ibr he admitted that with the exception of the pearson herd he did not know what disease was caused by the vaccine he also acknowledged that the ibr virus isolated in the pearson animal could have been the ibr virus contained in the vaccine he further acknowledged as did the veterinarians who testified in behalf of plaintiffs that both ibr and bvd can exist in an animal without the manifestation of any clinical symptoms of those diseases all of the veterinarians who examined and treated plaintiffs cattle following vaccination expressed the opinion that the illness in the cattle resulted from the use of the vaccine all of the veterinarians acknowledged that a positive diagnosis of ibr or bvd could be made only as a result of a laboratory test that isolated those viruses in animal tissue notwithstanding this however they all steadfastly maintained their opinions that based upon their experience in diagnosing livestock illnesses from observations of clinical symptoms in the field the animals in question were suffering illnesses resulting from the use of the vaccine the veterinarians were in agreement that it is a difficult task to isolate either ibr or bvd virus from tissues taken from dead animals in the field in view of the fact that in many cases there is a considerable delay between the death of the animals and the delivery of the tissues to the animal health laboratory at brookings the evidence revealed that the tissues submitted from plaintiffs animals were quite decomposed by the time the veterinarians performed the post mortem examinations the veterinarians were in agreement that the fact that the laboratory test results did not isolate viruses in all of the tissues was not conclusive proof that the animals were not suffering from a virus infection in this opinion they were joined by dr mailand vorhies director of the animal disease research and diagnostic laboratory and head of the veterinary science department at south dakota state university who testified on behalf of defendants in response to a question on crossexamination asking whether a negative laboratory finding with respect to tissue necessarily means that the veterinarian was wrong in his diagnosis dr vorhies replied no many times we are unable because of decomposition of tissues which may be toxic to the cells for example and are unable to identify virus or there may be contamination with other bacterial organs sic organisms dr vorhies also testified on crossexamination that there are post vaccinations or actions which i have investigated which would appear to be related to vaccination— yes—we know that attenuated viruses modified live do replicate in the body and there are occasions when the body defenses are unable then to control this virulent that does occur that is necessary for the immune response and they are involved in the—with illness—yes he went on to explain that a bvd virus and often an ibr virus had been identified through laboratory tests in other cases of virus vaccines which he had investigated and which had been proved to contain extraneous virus defendants called a number of their employees who testified with respect to the manner in which the ibrlepto vaccine was manufactured and tested in addition defendants also submitted the testimony of two employees of the united states department of agricultures veterinary services biologics laboratory at ames iowa the testimony of an associate professor at texas agricultural and mechanical universitys experimental station and project leader of that schools feedlot cattle disease research and the testimony of dr vorhies whose testimony has been alluded to suffice it to say that all of these witnesses appeared to be highly qualified experts in their respective fields of veterinary science and virology much of their testimony was highly technical in nature and tended to establish that the serial b vaccine was manufactured under very exacting standards and had satisfactorily passed all tests both in the laboratory and in use on controlled groups of animals moreover the evidence established that there may have been other causes of the illness in the herds in question plaintiffs based their claim for damages upon a claim of breach of implied warranty of fitness of the vaccine defendants answers to the complaints contained a general denial and an affirmative allegation that the vaccine was sold with a notice and disclaimer it was developed at trial that each bottle of the vaccine was accompanied by a small fourpage pamphlet which described the symptoms of ibr and leptospira pomona described the nature of the ibrlepto vaccine and bacterin contained instructions for restoring the vaccine to liquid form and the dosage to be used cautioned that the product should not be used on pregnant animals warned of a possible anaphylactic reaction and prescribed an antidote therefor and in the final subparagraph on the last page of the pamphlet contained the following notice notice franklin ibrlepto is produced and tested under the rigid standard of the united states department of agriculture it is a potent product and has passed all of the prescribed tests since the company has no control over the conditions under which the product is used condition or preexamination of cattle on which it is used methods of mixing or administration or ability of cattle to respond to vaccination we accept no responsibility for the results obtained following its use no representative of the company may change any of the foregoing and the buyer hereby accepts the product subject to all the terms hereof notwithstanding the fact that the cases were pleaded and tried on the theory of breach of implied warranty of fitness the trial court based its decision on the concept of strict liability in tort as adopted by this court in engberg v ford motor co  sd   nwd  defendants contend that by adopting the uniform commercial code the legislature precluded the courts from adopting the concept of liability that exceeds the scope of liability created under the warranty provisions of the uniform commercial code there is support for this position titus restatement second of torts section a and the uniform commercial code  stanlrev   see generally wade is section a of the second restatement of torts preempted by the ucc and therefore unconstitutional  tenn lrev   some courts have taken the position that the adoption of the uniform commercial code did not preclude the adoption by the judiciary of the doctrine of strict liability see e g caruth v mariani  arizapp   pd  larson v clark equipment co  coloapp   pd  west v caterpillar tractor co fla  sod  berry v g d searle  co  illd   ned  phipps v general motors corp  md   ad  markle v mulhollands inc  or   pd  kirkland v general motors corp okl  pd  dippel v sciano  wisd   nwd  at least one court has held that the adoption of the uniform commercial code did not preclude the imposition of liability on bailors and lessors under the doctrine of strict liability in tort martin v ryder truck rental inc del  ad  the nebraska supreme court has held that the doctrine of strict liability in tort is not to be applied in cases involving economic loss resulting from injury to the defective product itself hawkins contruction co v matthews co inc  neb   nwd  although in some cases the courts have not drawn a distinction between the concept of breach of warranty and strict liability in tort the two doctrines have different bases and are subject to different defenses in a breach of implied warranty case brought under the provisions of the uniform commercial code the defenses of lack of notice the requirement of privity although to what extent this requirement prevails under south dakotas version of the uniform commercial code remains problematical and disclaimer are available whereas in a suit based upon strict liability in tort they are not see e g caruth v mariani supra west v caterpillar tractor co supra berry v g d searle  co supra parish v b f goodrich co  mich    nwd   williams j dissenting elliott v lachance  nh   ad  dippel v sciano supra  frumer  friedman products liability § a j white  r summers handbook of the law under the uniform commercial code §   apart from the availability of these defenses in a breach of warranty case there is little difference between the two theories of liability once it has been established that a defect exists in the product that gives rise to the action for damages laying aside the question of recovery of damages for purely economic use herman v general irrigation co nd  nwd   frumer  friedman supra § a j white  r summers handbook supra §  but see brown v western farmers association  or   pd  in adopting the doctrine of strict liability in tort in the engberg case supra we did not pause to consider the potential conflict between the warranty provisions of the uniform commercial code and the concept of strict liability in this we were not alone see e g johnson v american motors corp nd  nwd  in sweetman construction co v dakota pump inc sd  nwd  we did recognize the possibility that there may be some limitations upon the applicability of the strict liability doctrine but we were not called upon to resolve the issue in that case likewise we conclude that in the instant case the matter of liability could and should have been resolved upon plaintiffs pleaded theory of breach of implied warranty and we reserve until another day the question whether the adoption of the uniform commercial code by the legislature has limited our authority to impose a broader concept of liability for damages resulting from defective products we turn then to an examination of the evidence in the light of the provisions of the south dakota uniform commercial code sdcl  provides unless excluded or modified §§  to  inclusive a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind    sdcl  provides in part that goods to be merchantable must be at least such as        are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used    sdcl  provides where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the sellers skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods there is unless excluded or modified under §§  to  inclusive an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose we note that the trial court entered findings of fact to the effect that defendants had implied a warranty that the vaccine was fit for the purpose for which it was sold that the vaccine was defective and not fit for its purpose and that defendants had breached their implied warranty the court then concluded that defendants were liable under the doctrine of strict liability it is not clear from these findings whether the trial court was speaking of an implied warranty of merchantability under sdcl  or an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose under sdcl  there is of course a difference between these two types of warranty j white  r summers handbook supra §  cf fulwider v flynn sd  nwd  as we view plaintiffs complaints they allege a cause of action under the theory of breach of implied warranty of fitness of the vaccine for the purpose for which it was to be used a claim cognizable under the provisions of sdcl  the first question to be answered is whether ibrlepto vaccine was not fit for the purpose for which such vaccines are used and therefore unmerchantable within the meaning of sdcl  and if so whether such unfitness was the cause of the sickness and death in plaintiffs herds defendants strenuously contend that not only did plaintiffs fail to establish that the vaccine was defective the trial court stated in its memorandum decision that it would not attempt to isolate the possible specific causative agent or agents in the vaccine that caused the outbreaks of illness in the livestock it is true that plaintiffs witnesses were unable to demonstrate that the vaccine was contaminated or otherwise unfit or defective it is also true that defendants evidence tended to show that the vaccine had passed all tests both franklins and those of texas a  m university and the united states department of agricultures biologic laboratories on the other hand plaintiffs evidence supports the trial courts findings that plaintiffs cattle as well as cattle in other herds had become ill within the approximate time span and with the same clinical symptoms after being vaccinated with the serial b vaccine whereas herds that had been vaccinated with other serials of defendants vaccines and like vaccines manufactured by other drug manufacturers did not become ill to require plaintiffs to submit greater evidence than the testimony of the veterinarians who to a person stood by their opinions that the illness was caused by defendants vaccine together with the circumstantial evidence would be to require a degree of proof that goes beyond the standard of preponderance of the evidence defects in products can be shown by circumstantial as well as by direct evidence as we said recently in shaffer v honeywell inc sd  nwd   no specific defect need be shown if the evidence direct or circumstantial permits the inference that the accident was caused by a defect see also sweetman construction co v dakota pump inc supra kupkowski v avis ford inc  mich   nwd  as professors white and summers have stated post hoc propter hoc is normally not enough the plaintiff must show more than that the goods injured the plaintiff in a certain way however it is not always necessary that the plaintiff offer expert testimony or explicit proof to disclose the precise chain of causation   of course other courts have required plaintiffs to go to greater lengths to rule out rival plausible hypotheses and it appears that in most cases the plaintiff will wish to procure expert testimony however when the connection between the product and the injury is reasonably obvious even to a layman expert proof and explicit analysis of the chain of causation should not be necessary j white  r summers handbook supra §  at  here plaintiffs did offer expert testimony to support their claims that the veterinarians by their own admission were not specialists in virology and had not conducted any laboratory tests of the vaccine did not preclude the trial court from accepting their testimony buttressed by the circumstantial evidence that the illness resulted from the use of the vaccine likewise the fact that defendants evidence tended to establish that there were other possible causes of the illness in plaintiffs herds did not foreclose a finding by the trier of fact that defendants vaccine was in fact unfit and the cause of the illness c a hoover  son v o m franklin serum co tex  swd  in weighing the evidence against the trial courts findings we have given due regard to the fact that many of defendants expert witnesses testified in the presence of the trial court some on adverse as well as on direct whereas with one exception dr reed plaintiffs experts the veterinarians testified by deposition although the clearly erroneous rule of sdcl a does not apply to testimony introduced by deposition geo a clark  son inc v nold  sd   nwd  after making due allowance for the bias in favor of plaintiffs that two of the veterinarians frankly admitted we are satisfied that the trial courts findings are amply supported by the evidence in reaching this conclusion we have not overlooked this courts decision in murphy v sioux falls serum co  sd   nw  suffice it to say that the claim of liability in that case was predicated upon the negligence of the manufacturer of the hog serum the factor of negligence is of no relevance in establishing a breach of warranty case under the uniform commercial code j white  r summers handbook supra §  moreover the circumstantial evidence in terms of the incidence of illness following the use of the serum bore no relationship to that in the instant cases we express no opinion whether the outbreak of illness in only one herd following the use of defendants ibrlepto vaccine would have been sufficient to sustain a finding that the vaccine was unfit and was the cause of the illness there remains the question of defendants defense of disclaimer defendants have not raised the defenses of lack of privity or notice we have already set forth the terms of the purported disclaimer above sdcl  provides subject to §§  to  inclusive to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states for example that there are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof sdcl  provides notwithstanding §  unless the circumstances indicate otherwise all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like as is with all faults or other language which in common understanding calls the buyers attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty as sdcl  makes clear any attempt to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability must mention merchantability and must be conspicuous if in writing we conclude that defendants attempt to disclaim its implied warranty of merchantability fails both tests first of course the disclaimer does not mention the word merchantability second the writing is not conspicuous in defining terms applicable to the uniform commercial code sdcl  provides that     conspicuous a term or clause is conspicuous when it is so written that a reasonable person against whom it is to operate ought to have noticed it a printed heading in capitals as nonnegotiable bill of lading is conspicuous language in the body of a form is conspicuous if it is in larger or other contrasting type or color but in a telegram any stated term is conspicuous whether a term or clause is conspicuous or not is for decision by the court    the test whether a written provision disclaiming a warranty is conspicuous is whether attention can reasonably be expected to be called to it uniform commercial code §  comment  under sdcl  and the last sentence of sdcl  it is a question of law for the court whether a provision purporting to disclaim an implied warranty of merchantability is conspicuous and an appellate court is in as good a position to decide that issue as is the trial court where the purported disclaimer is a part of the record on appeal marion power shovel co v huntsman  ark   swd  hunt v perkins machinery co  mass   ned  we conclude that the disclaimer in question is not conspicuous because it appears in the same size of type and on the last page of the pamphlet extols the virtues and the effectiveness of the vaccine indeed within the notice and disclaimer paragraph itself is a reaffirmation of the potency of the vaccine and an assertion that it has passed all of the prescribed tests we doubt that a busy rancher would pore over the last few lines of the paragraph after earlier being assured of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine the directions for its use and the steps to be taken should an anaphylactic reaction occur language more conspicuous than this has been held to be ineffective as a disclaimer hunt v perkins machinery co supra see also mack trucks of ark inc v jet asphalt  rock co  ark   swd  mobile county gas district v national cash register co  ala   sod  geo c christopher  son inc v kansas paint  color co inc  kan   pd  baker v city of seattle  wnd   pd  annot  alrd  §  cf kleven v geigy agricultural chemicals  minn   nwd  likewise we conclude that the disclaimer is not effective under the provisions of sdcl  disclaimers of warranty are to be strictly construed against the seller hauter v zogarts  cald   calrptr   pd  woodruff v clark county farm bureau coop assn inc  indapp   ned  we held as much in swenson v chevron chemical co sd  nwd  that case involved an express warranty it is true as did hauter v zogarts supra but we see no reason to differentiate between express and implied warranties in this regard the phrase    we accept no responsibility for the results following its use buried in the middle of the purported disclaimer is ambiguous at best does it mean that defendants disclaim responsibility for the possible failure of the vaccine to prevent the outbreak of diseases it was intended to prevent is it an attempted exclusion of liability for illnesses caused by the vaccine itself or is it both we do not believe that a purchaser should be required to make these nice distinctions our conclusion that defendants purported disclaimer is ineffective under sdcl  because of its ambiguous wording obviates the necessity of our deciding whether a disclaimer under this section of the uniform commercial code is also governed by the requirement of conspicuousness applicable to disclaimers under sdcl  a question on which the authorities are divided compare woodruff v clark county farm bureau coop assn supra fairchild industries v maritime air service  md   ad  gindy manufacturing corp v cardinale trucking corp  njsuper   ad  with dekalb agresearch inc v abbott ndala  fsupp  affd fifth circuit  fd  see also j white  r summers handbook supra §  at  cross appeal on damages relying upon this courts decision in overpeck v city of rapid city  sd   nw  the trial court awarded plaintiffs their costs of treatment and labor in caring for the sick animals together with damages for lost calf production and for the loss of value of the sick animals based upon their value after they had recovered from their illness although plaintiffs contend that the trial court should have applied the measure of damages discussed in olson v aldren  sd   nwd  and hall v umiker  sd   nwd  they conceded at oral argument that had defendants not appealed plaintiffs would not have appealed on the question of damages without belaboring the point we conclude that the trial court did not err in the manner in which it awarded damages the judgments are affirmed in all respects all the justices
