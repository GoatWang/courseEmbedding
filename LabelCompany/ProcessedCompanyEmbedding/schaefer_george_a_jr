unknown children three career fifth third bancorp – various positions – senior vice president in commerciallending department – president and coo – ceo and president awards bronze star us army banker of the year american banker   address fifth third bancorp  fountain square plaza cincinnati ohio  httpwwwcom ■ george a schaefer jr the chief executive officer at the cincinnatibased fifth third bancorp was once described as a numberscrunching pennypinching workaholic  insitutional investor  july  schaefer drifted into the banking business by mere chance bearing an unrelated military and engineering background while fifth third had already possessed a hardworking everybodysellsallthetime frugal corporate culture when he took the helm in  schaefer added his engineers love of gathering data and measuring everything as well as an aggressive leadership style to the mix he once compared banking to guerrilla warfare for many people under schaefers leadership fifth third was not an easy place to work type a people who thrived in meritocracies on the other hand were quite at home over the span of schaefers tenure fifth thirds assets increased from  billion to more than  billion fifth third had not even been the largest bank in cincinnati when he took over but  years later it ranked among the  largest bankholding companies in the united states in terms of assets and among the top  in market capitalization workingclass roots schaefer was born in  in the workingclass community of west cincinnati with five brothers and sisters he developed an extremely competitive personality which he nurtured by playing highschool football it was schaefers football coach who gave him an application to west point during his senior year schaefer recalled that his coach had said mr schaefer i think youre the only person on this team who can read why dont you fill this out and send it in  american banker  march   because he lacked the money to attend a strictly academic university—rather than because he possessed an overabundant sense of patriotism—schaefer applied to west point he was accepted regardless of his motivation schaefer came to appreciate the discipline instilled by the academy in its cadets after graduating in  with a degree in engineering he attended the us armys elite ranger school in fort benning georgia schaefer then spent two years in germany serving with a nucleardemolition munitions team during the height of the cold war his unit was assigned to destroy roads and bridges using small nuclear bombs in the case of an attack launched by the soviets—a task that brought perspective years later to the pressures of running a bank schaefer completed his commitment to the army by going to vietnam for two years during the war while supervising a man crew constructing a strategically important highway he learned how to perform under pressure and gained lessons about leadership that would influence his business career in a profile in insitutional investor  he explained if you take good care of your people whether theyre soldiers in vietnam or bankers selling checking accounts in chicago then theyll do a marvelous job for you july  the highway construction was dangerous work with his crew always in jeopardy of being shot at by the enemy as well as mistakenly by fellow americans for his service schaefer was awarded a bronze star for valor hiring freeze at nuclear plant leads to banking career schaefer had no interest in remaining in the army beyond his west point commitment in  he returned home to cincinnati he applied for an engineering job at the nearby zimmer nuclear power plant which was being built by cincinnati gas and electric but as a result of a delay in the issuing of the plants license a hiring freeze was imposed with no other engineering positions available in the area schaefer decided to become a management trainee at fifth third for a salary of  a year fifth thirds origins could be traced to the  opening of the bank of the ohio valley in cincinnati that institution was purchased in  by third national bank which merged in  with fifth national bank forming the fifth third national bank of cincinnati fifth third bancorp was formed as a holding company in  when schaefer joined fifth third it was headed by william s rowe the fourthgeneration cincinnati banker who over his year tenure infused the bank with a frugal conservative approach according to schaefer he wouldnt spend a nickel to see an earthquake  american banker  march   rowes successor clement l buenger who took over in  had a background in the grocery and insurance industries and brought the perspective gained from a sales culture to fifth third with an emphasis on hard work both mens strengths would inform schaefers approach to business as the trained engineer turned accidental banker worked his way up through the organization taking the advice of a brotherinlaw who worked at the federal reserve in cincinnati schaefer at first asked to be assigned to the commercialloan department he would later find a better use for his superior mathematical skills in taking over the banks dataprocessing operation in the mids fifth third became involved in the creditcard business initially relying on bank one to do the necessary processing work when fifth third decided to do processing inhouse management discovered that the company lacked both the necessary computer power and programming personnel during the operations overhaul schaefer was put in charge of the dataprocessing unit midwest payments systems that business would eventually become a profit center for fifth third through the processing of creditcard and atm transactions for other companies schaefers strong performance in his new role caught the attention of the banks upper management and directors nightschool mba to help advance his career schaefer went to night school earning an mba from xavier university after several years heading midwest payments in  schaefer returned to the commercialloan department three years later he was named the departments senior vice president in  when he was just  years old schaefer had his first heartbypass operation—a routine followup operation would be conducted in —but health concerns did little to delay his advancement at fifth third in  schaefer became the head of commercial lending and executive vice president the next major step in his career came in  when he was appointed president and chief operating officer when buenger retired on january   schaefer became fifth thirds new ceo schaefer took over a wellestablished institution with a strong corporate culture in the words of american banker  his challenge was to fill the big shoes of clement buenger who  years ago took over a profitable pennypinching conservative bank and turned it into a very profitable pennypinching conservative bank july   at fifth third everyone was a salesperson employees from any number of departments made calls to attract business tellers were paid  if they convinced a customer to apply for a fifth third credit card another legacy from buenger was the banks early move into supermarket locations which provided a convenient venue through which to do business with a wider range of customers in keeping with fifth thirds cult of salesmanship one of schaefers first acts as ceo was to lead  employees on a doortodoor sales campaign to drum up new business for the bank the one who knocked on the most doors was awarded a  pair of allan edmond shoes such luxuries while suitable as sales incentives were not common at fifth third which was known for its thriftiness the banks headquarters made do with yearold carpeting executives flew coach business lunches were a rarity and midwest payment relied on two secondhand ibm mainframe computers to conduct business schaefer took pennypinching at the bank to the next level disposing of the few cars owned by the bank for company use from that point on even schaefer drove his own car on local business and was reimbursed for mileage schaefers obsession with cost controls resulted in strong profits while banks spent on average about  cents for every revenue dollar fifth third spent just  cents for their hard work and incessant selling fifth third employees were rewarded with a generous share of the profits schaefer had assumed control of an institution that was conservative on other levels as well at the senior ranks fifth third was an allmale club and buenger was known to send female employees home to change if he deemed their attire inappropriate overall schaefer inherited a bank that was well run and one of the best performers in the industry he readily admitted that he had no overarching strategy and that his strength lay in the daytoday execution of his job if anything his vision was to do the same as his predecessor—sell—simply to a greater extent he proved relentless in riding herd on his employees one of his first actions was to light a fire under the trust business which had failed to measure up to his expectations as an engineer number cruncher schaefer eventually took advantage of fifth thirds managementinformation system to keep tabs on all of the companys major profit centers ensuring that all employees were kept abreast of who the winners and losers were schaefer was not known to lose his temper or try to intimidate anyone he simply let statistics pit executives and their groups against one another peer pressure to avoid landing on the bottom of one of schaefers wellcirculated lists was more than enough motivation for his employees if they lacked driven type a personalities they generally didnt stick around very long a decade of conservative expansion schaefer was both ambitious and conservative as he expanded fifth third one safe step at a time in his first two years he completed several small acquisitions then in  attempted a bolder move making an unsolicited takeover bid for star banc corporation fifth thirds chief competitor in cincinnati when the offer was rejected by stars board schaefer backed off somewhat humbled he returned to his more cautious approach to expansion over the course of  years schaefer oversaw the acquisition of more than  small banks thrifts and branch purchases—mostly institutions with assets in the  million range but as fifth third grew larger so did its capacity to make sizable deals and schaefer did not shy away from the challenge the bank made a pivotal move in  when it completed the  billion purchase of the evansville indiana–based cnb bancshares which placed fifth third on the edge of the coveted chicago market as the s came to a close schaefer was managing an enterprise that ranked among americas top  banks boasting more than  billion in assets its core branch network was located in the three states of ohio kentucky and indiana and was supplemented by operations in other states especially florida but with the companys increases in size came complications to avoid the risk of spreading fifth third too thin schaefer looked for inmarket acquisitions the dramatic increase in the number of employees threatened to dilute the companys cherished culture to address that issue he expanded the banks educational programs new training facilities were opened teams from the benefits department made more visits to employees of acquired operations and a weekly newsletter was created to keep the much larger workforce informed to manage fifth thirds expanding banking enterprise schaefer created what one management consultant described as a model of supercommunity banking  insitutional investor  july  in essence he established a management structure that broke acquisitions into smaller pieces creating confederations of regional affiliates each with a great deal of local decisionmaking power field officers were charged with serving customers according to their needs while the home office set performance goals and provided administrative marketing and product support schaefer tried to put his own people in charge wherever possible employees at new acquisitions were quickly inculcated with fifth thirds culture although the assimilation was not always successful a case in point was schaefers attempt to break into the securities industry in  fifth third acquired the columbusbased ohio company a regional brokerage firm according to an american banker article a significant number of brokers reportedly left out of dissatisfaction with the buyers operating style and some took a lot of client assets with them march   this case was an exception however over schaefers first  years at the helm of fifth third gambles on old kent acquisition schaefer displayed a gambling side to his personality in november  when—in the midst of an economic downturn—he agreed to pay  billion for old kent financial corporation of grand rapids michigan the deal was more than twice the size of the cnb acquisition and was a key addition because it provided fifth third with direct entry into the lucrative chicago market as well as other parts of illinois and michigan the addition of old kent brought the value of fifth thirds assets to  billion and with  billion in deposits and one thousand banking locations fifth third was now one of the five largest banks in the fivestate area of indiana illinois kentucky michigan and ohio the acquisition did not come without problems however schaefer announced that a large number of old kents seven thousand employees would be laid off which made the task of persuading the remaining employees to buy into fifth thirds culture which was not geared toward people adverse to meritocracy a difficult one as he had done with previous acquisitions schaefer reorganized old kent forming three affiliate banks two of which including one in the allimportant chicago market would be headed by trustworthy fifth third executives schaefer hoped to break up old kents culture allowing him to more easily convert employees to the fifth third way of conducting business looking for growth opportunities after old kent schaefer continued to look for opportunities to spur fifth thirds growth by way of acquisitions yet he reverted to a more cautious approach looking for deals which would merely provide toeholds in new markets from there the bank could employ a technique that it had used successfully in the past expanding outward and building market share new markets that schaefer considered opportunistic existed in the st louis pittsburgh and milwaukee areas he was also interested in the cities of charleston west virginia and knoxville tennessee in  fifth third agreed to acquire the tennesseebased franklin financial corporation a bank with  million in assets however the  million deal was held up because of concerns on behalf of the federal reserve bank of cleveland and the ohio department of commerces division of financial institutions in light of the banks september  admission to the securities and exchange commission that it was unable to account for  million worth of internal investment funds the matter hung over fifth third for the next  months delaying the franklin financial acquisition and tarnishing to a certain extent the reputations of both schaefer and fifth third when regulatory concerns were finally resolved schaefer was able to continue his quest to spur fifth thirds growth he maintained that he planned to retire before he turned  a decision he said was unrelated to his previous heart problems yet as long as he was in charge at fifth third it remained likely that he would continue to expand the banks operations by and large opting for the conservative route but occasionally exhibiting a willingness to take chances he told forbes  this business is like playing poker you have to ante up or get out of the game january   see also entry on fifth third bancorp in international directory of company histories  sources
