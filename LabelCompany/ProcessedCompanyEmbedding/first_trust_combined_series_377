the uit name which will take you to the first trust website or enter the symbol at the  first trust website description the sabrient dividend uit series seeks aboveaverage total returns through a combination of capital appreciation and dividend income the stocks are selected by applying a sevenstep investment strategy process developed by sabrient among other criteria stocks must have aboveaverage dividend yield a minimum of six consecutive dividends that were the same or better than the previous quarter strong earnings growth potential along with a market cap of  million or more and sufficient liquidity in addition the sabrientgradient earnings quality rank eqr rank a proprietary forensic accounting factor is incorporated into the strategy to determine the relative safety of the dividends over the next two years   uit process sabrients stock selection process for  uits combines the research methodology of both sabrient and gradient analytics for each uit series a quantitative seriesspecific strategy is developed by the sabrient research team led by chief market strategist david brown a critical element of all strategies is the sabrientgradient earnings quality rank eqr rank a proprietary forensic accounting factor that measures the aggressiveness of a companys accounting practices companies in the bottom quintile of the eqr rankings are eliminated from consideration this helps us avoid the risk of companies that could be overstating reported growth for each portfolio in the series a list of strong candidates is compiled based on the relevant quant strategy then the sabrient team led david brown qualitatively reviews the list of stocks to select the final candidates the final step in the process is a review by the gradient analytics team led by director of research nicholas yee cpa  this team further screens out any candidates that might not have been eliminated by the eqr rankings but that nevertheless demonstrate unique risks related to
