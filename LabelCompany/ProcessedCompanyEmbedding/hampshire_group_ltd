hampshire is a public company listed on the nasdaq and is percent owned by its longtime chairman and chief executive officer ludwig g kuttner who in  was placed on administrative leave along with others at the company while an audit committee investigated allegations of misuse and misappropriations of assets for personal benefit company incorporated  hampshire was formed in south carolina and incorporated in delaware in  the result of a merger between a hosiery company and a sweater company the latter launched the designers originals label in  in order to sell acrylic sweaters to the mass market the divergent businesses were operated through a pair of subsidiaries hampshire designers located in anderson south carolina to produce sweaters and hampshire hosiery located in spruce pine north carolina to manufacture pantyhose tights stockings and thighhigh and kneehigh stockings a predecessor company had been engaged in hosiery manufacturing since  two years after hampshire group was founded kuttner became chairman and ran the business from offices in new york city born in munich west germany in august  he grew up in postwar europe earning a college degree from the university of reyensburg before coming to the united states his father dr ludwig kuttner owned kuttner nak prints inc a lyndhurst new jerseybased fashion fabric printer that provided heat transfer prints for junior apparel and sportswear by  hampshire group was a  million business split equally between the hosiery and sweater units over the next four years the company built up its hosiery assets while overall sales tailed off in  it spent nearly  million to add the production assets of hosiery company trend industries then in february  hampshire acquired belmont north carolinabased vision hosiery mills which made christian dior hosiery under a licensing agreement and did about  million in overall sales vision hosiery became a third division for hampshire group its purchase was part of a strategy to sell higherpriced merchandise items that retailed for  or more in order to offer such highend sweaters hampshire acquired five specialized knitting machines that could produce intricate patterns using lambs wool cashmere and other expensive yarns becoming the only north american sweater manufacturer to own this kind of equipment at this stage in the companys history however hosiery accounted for most  percent of hampshires  million in revenues in  the addition of vision hosiery was the difference the new unit by itself contributing  percent of sales ipo  in  kuttner took hampshire public with the investment banking firm of legg mason serving as book manager hampshire completed an initial public offering of stock in june  the company hoped to receive  to  a share but in the end had to settle for  a share as a result hampshire netted about  million the money was earmarked primarily to reduce debt but some was also kept as working capital about a week after the offering kuttner stepped down as hampshires chief executive while remaining in new york to act as chairman he was succeeded by richard owczarzak a year veteran of the apparel business who worked out of the companys charlotte north carolina offices his tenure at the helm would be brief however as kuttner soon took back the ceo post sweaters became more important to hampshire in  when hosiery sales slumped due to softening demand while hampshire designers was enjoying a record year in response to conditions hampshire consolidated its hosiery operations closing a finishing plant in belmont north carolina and another facility in concord north carolina the work done at these locations was moved to hampshires three other hosiery plants the company pursued a privatelabel strategy producing hosiery for mass merchants chains and highend customers under their private labels hampshires sweater business in the meantime was not overly diversified and was mostly limited to two product lines womens branded acrylic sweaters a market that had matured and offered little opportunity for growth and highquality cotton sweaters sold through mail order channels all were manufactured in the united states and hampshires only significant brand was designers original moreover retailers were looking to buy from fewer and larger suppliers all these factors essentially forced hampshire to diversify its sweater segment in an effort to become something of a onestop shop capable of filling a customers complete sweater needs both mens and womens and at all price tiers this effort would also require the company to expand hampshires manufacturing capabilities beyond the united states and embrace global sourcing in early  hampshire completed the  million purchase of san francisco knitworks taking hampshire into the mens and womens better sweater business the new unit produced sweaters for designers calvin klein donna karan and anne klein despite the added business revenues continued to dip to  million in  in  hampshire began an effort to diversify beyond sweaters early in the year it acquired seque ltd maker of uppermoderate and betterprice sweaters as well as womens blazers blouses skirts and pants the company had offices in new york and hong kong and generated annual sales in the neighborhood of  million later in  hampshire added designer mary jane marcasiano and her signature line of knitwear to the fold and added such highend accounts as barneys new york bergdorf goodman saks fifth avenue and bloomingdales also in october  hampshire acquired the winona knitting mills inc of winona minnesota founded in  winona did about  million in business each year in mens sweaters mostly the result of privatelabel work for the likes of woolrich lands end and ll bean it also produced mens sweaters under the landscape the lake harmony rowing club berwick and american portrait brands in  hampshire added another well known brand geoffrey beene to its mens sweater line as a result of its acquisition spree hampshire experienced a sharp rise in net sales which reached  million in  and  million in  net income also increased to  million in  and approached  million in  when hampshire sold more than  million sweaters sweater sales in  accounted for  million while hosiery sales totaled just  million this disparity grew even wider in  when sweater sales increased to  million and hosiery sales slipped further to  million for net sales of  million also of note in  hampshire looked to gain further diversity in its business by forming hampshire investments limited in the first year the venture invested about  million in publicly traded apparel and textile companies as well as real estate entertainment industrial and service businessesareas that kuttner had been investing in personally for the previous  years hampshire faced strong competition in the sweater field in  but its diversified offerings helped it to increase sales to  million and stave off a significant erosion in earnings for the year hampshire netted  million the mary jane marcasiano label performed poorly enough that the company elected to sell it in  hampshire investments made further investments in  the value of which increased to  million split  percent real property and  percent stock the hosiery business by this point was no longer a core business and the hampshire took steps to sell it to a management team the buyout was completed in june  poor market conditions continued in  one bright spot was the signing of a license agreement with levi strauss  co to produce and market mens sweaters under the highly popular dockers label by this point about half of hampshires sweaters were produced overseas due primarily to a significant drop in the sale of mens nonbranded sweaters hampshire experienced a drop in net sales to  million in  while earnings dipped below  million factories sold  hampshire took the next step in its development in  when it sold all of its manufacturing plants in favor of a worldwide sourcing network the company also achieved greater diversity in  by acquiring itemeyes inc for  million itemeyes added a broad line of womens coordinated sportswear  million in sales and major department stores accounts such as macys and jc penney co hampshire added further breadth to its sweater lines in  by signing licensing agreements with levi strauss and vf corp to produce and market mens sweaters under the levis wrangler wrangler hero and timber creek labels and womens sweaters under the dockers and riders labels as a result of these changes hampshire grew sales to  million in  and to  million in  while net income improved to  million in  and  million in  with the apparel business doing so well hampshire investments was no longer deemed an important factor in the companys business and in  it was sold to a management group hampshire devoted all of its attention to further growing its sweater and other apparel lines in  the company launched a new mens sweater collection spring  mercer an allusion to a pair of intersecting streets in new york citys trendy soho neighborhood the line offered luxurious and fashionable yet affordable sweaters the nick danger line of mens sweaters followed in  nick danger was intended to be a casual wear design brand that could include other apparel revenues topped  million and net income totaled  million in  hampshire focused attention on its womens offerings especially in the upper end of the market the david brooks country club chic clothing line was acquired in  to form its own division then in  the marisa christina brand was purchased for  million an  million company marisa christina offered a lifestyle apparel collection that appealed to a younger demographic than hampshires other lines it was sold in specialty stores and upscale department stores hampshire also sought to appeal to younger customers by acquiring san franciscobased shane hunter inc which sold juniors apparel to mass merchant retailers including target and mervyns hampshire was enjoying strong growth with sales reaching  million and net income to  million in  but the company would also have to contend with controversy in june  the company announced that a probe would be launched by an audit committee and the board of directors to investigate claims connected to the misappropriation of assets for personal benefit certain related party transactions tax reporting internal control deficiencies and the reporting and accounting of expense reimbursements until the matter had been fully examined kuttner was placed on
