“bestefforts” basis no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed the offering price per share is  the following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of   and  respectively of the securities offered for sale by the company we reserve the right to change the use of proceeds provided that such reservation is due to certain contingencies that are discussed specifically and the alternatives to such use in that event are indicated in an amended prospectus reflecting the same there is no assurance that we will raise the full  as anticipated we believe that we will be able to partially satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next  months from the net proceeds of this offering this estimate is based on certain assumptions including among others achieving a customer base and revenue continued expansion and conforming actual costs to estimates the expenses anticipated to be incurred in expansion of our marketing capabilities cannot be predicted with certainty currently we do not have any revenues and have not yet located financing to implement our business plan initial growth may be very limited and based solely on loans from mr dai which he has agreed to there can be no assurance that unforeseen events will not occur which might increase anticipated expenses in which case the net proceeds of this offering might satisfy our cash requirements for less than the anticipated time period the foregoing represents our best estimate of our use of the net proceeds of the offering based on present planning and business conditions we reserve the right to change our use of proceeds as unanticipated changes such as increased expenses rapid growth or intense competition may cause us to redirect our priorities and reallocate the proceeds for working capital purposes if we are not able to raise sufficient proceeds from the sale of the common stock registered in this offering we will not implement our business plan at all except maintaining our reporting with the sec and remain in good standing with the state of nevada we will also need more funds if the costs of marketing and sales are greater than we have budgeted we will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues these funds may be raised through equity financing debt financing or other sources which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares we currently do not have any arrangements regarding this offering or following this offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing the successful development of our business a successful marketing and promotion program attracting and further in the future achieving a profitable level of operations the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations as widely reported the global and domestic financial markets have been extremely volatile in recent months if such conditions and constraints continue we may not be able to acquire additional funds either through credit markets or through equity markets even if additional financing is available it may not be available on terms we find favorable at this time there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business we may change the use of proceeds because of changes in our business plan investors should understand that we have wide discretion of the use of proceeds gross proceeds

carry forward with its business plan and decrease its budgeted expenditures and mr dai has agreed to loan the company funds in order to supplement any cash shortage if necessary jinshan dai our president and sole officer and director has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process as mr dai’s agreement with the company is verbal it is not contractually binding these loans will be necessary if the proceeds from this offering are not sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the otc electronic bulletin board when and if our common stock becomes eligible for trading on the overthecounter bulletin board mr dai will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering there are many barriers of entry in the baby product market and the level of competition is extremely high examples of barriers of entry in this market include brand loyalty aggressive lower pricing tactics and economies of scale many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their baby products to ours aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to enter and compete in this market economies of scale make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of baby products which would leave us at a disadvantage the principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality of our products we will be in a market where we will be in direct competition with many domestic and international companies offering similar products many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies may have a greater and more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better prices for similar products than us which may also cause us to lose business we also foresee challenges facing new market entrants we may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations adamas ventures inc has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to date once we enter the market we will be one of many participants in the business of distributing baby products many established and wellfinanced entities are currently active in the business of distributing such products nearly all of adamas ventures incs competitors have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than adamas ventures inc we are consequently at a competitive disadvantage in the market therefore adamas ventures inc may not be able to establish itself within the industry at all our competitive advantage is that we will offer stylish easytouse high quality products while maintaining reasonable prices we intend on advertising our products on baby product websites parenting forums on online lead generations sites selling payperlead advertising internet search engines such as google selling costperclick advertising and offline media including newspaper outdoor advertising radio television and

america and sell the products directly to retailers we have not yet identified any manufacturers or shipping companies or negotiated any arrangements for such services our business plan first includes
