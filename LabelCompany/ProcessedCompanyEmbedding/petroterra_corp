sevier and beaver oil project about the region project photos utah the future of american energy utah’s long history of oil and gas exploration dates back  when natural gas was discovered in farmington bay during the drilling of a water well of course it wasn’t until more recently –  – that the first large commercial well was drilled since then utah has been recognized as a major oil and gas powerhouse by  utah was the th largest oilproducing state in the country in  usa today listed utah as the eighth most oilrich state utahs oil and gas production  from production reports submitted and processed as of september     based on increasing number of drilling permits oil and gas ep activity in utah shows steady growth utah region highlights as of  utah reported proven oil reserves of  million barrels utah is the eighth most oilrich state utah is home to four productive oil plays the central utah thrust belt is the most recently discovered of the four the sevier and beaver oil prospects are located in the central utah thrust belt millions in upgrades to roads refineries and other utah infrastructure are planned to assist with expected increases in oil and gas production   four oil and gas producing areas in utah four major areas host utah’s oil plays utahwyoming thrust belt central utah thrust belt uinta basin and paradox basin until recently most of the activity in utah centered around the utahwyoming thrust belt uinta basin and paradox basin however since the exciting new utah central thrust belt area was tapped by wolverine oil in  the fourth major utah play has garnered more attention thrust belt in utah the thrust belt in utah is part of a larger belt structure that runs from northern alaska to central america called the cordilleran orogenic belt in southern canada the structure has been a wellknown oil and gas producer for several decades there are two productive areas of the thrust belt in utah the first was tapped in northeastern utah with the discovery of pineview along the utahwyoming thrust belt in  three decades later the discovery of covenant field opened up a second area the central utah thrust belt there are four major oil and gas plays in utah the newest is the central utah thrust belt timeline the thrust belt in utah  the discovery of oil in the jurassic nugget sandstone at pineview is the first significant discovery in the cordilleran hinge belt – rocky mountain association of geologists  symposium  the portion of the overthrust belt located in northeastern utah western wyoming and southeastern idaho is considered by the oil and gas industry to be the hottest new oil and gas province in the continental united states – the geological survey of wyoming  stunning utah oil gas discovery focuses spotlight on hingeline

transportation and utah’s oil and gas production in order to ensure that utah oil and gas production reaches its potential utah policymakers and business leaders are taking steps to ensure that oil and gas exploration drilling and processing companies have access to transportation there are currently three major oil and gas transportation options in the state road one of utah’s main transportation arteries is us a mile highway that runs from atlantic city new jersey to park city utah the majority of utah’s oil and gas processing facilities are located along us so as oil and gas production steps up in all areas of the state it will be important to ensure that this highway can handle an increase in traffic in april of  the utah transportation commission announced plans for a  million highway improvement project intended to prevent traffic and congestion due to increased oil and gas explorationproduction in addition the utah department of transportation udot is planning another  million in upgrades to us which will take place over the next several years upgrades will include the addition of passing lanes as well as general improvements that will enable the road to handle increased traffic and heavier vehicles associated with oil and gas transportation refineries utah is home to five refineries their capacity is  barrels a day this means the state is a net importer to its refineries and local refineries could therefore handle more production from local sources versus the canadian and outofstate crude which accounts for a high percentage of the crude they are currently handling all of the state’s major oil and gas players – including hollyfrontier tesoro and chevron – have all announced plans to step up their processing capabilities in the state in addition rock river resources announced plans for the  million green river refinery project expansions or improvements to the state’s refineries will enable them to process three times the paraffinicbased crude as they could six years ago this expanded capacity bodes well for producers in utah who will likely have little need to ship their oil to other states for processing pipeline utah is home to more than  miles of oil and natural gas pipeline — and that number is expected to increase to keep up with demands from increased production in the state current and future utah pipeline expansions include expansion of the midamerica pipeline mapl system the mapl expansion expected to be completed and operational in the second quarter of  is a mile natural gas pipeline in western coloradoeastern utah the expansion would increase the mapl system’s capacity by  bbls per day the western expansion project iii approved by the bureau of land management blm in july of  the western expansion project iii is a mile natural gas pipeline that will run from new mexico to south texas although it won’t be constructed in utah the new pipeline will be used to transport ngls from the state’s processing plants rail as domestic oil and natural gas production steadily increases in the rocky mountain region oil and gas companies have turned to rail as a fast reliable and costeffective way to transport crude oil and natural gas to other parts of the country the amount of crude oil transported by rail has increased steadily in the past several years in  about  train cars transported crude oil by the end of  that number had jumped up to just over  carloads      httpwwwusatodaycomstorymoneybusinessthemostoilrichstates   httpgeologyutahgovonlinepipipdf

burnoct  about petroterra corp ptra hunter straus longterm horizon growth longshort equitysummaryptra is being promoted by the wall street reportthe companys balance sheet shows only  in cashinsiders own over  of the common stockthe companys latest k lists only one employeei have attempted to contact management regarding the ongoing promotional activitybackground petroterra corporation otcqbptra has recently been the subject of a series of paid promotional advertisements from wall street report  most recently on october  and october th promotional emails went out which disclosed that wall street report was being compensated  for the promotion like nearly all companies that have experienced paid promotions ptra has abysmal financials an unrealistic business plan and few employees i believe that ptra common stock is near worthless and in the weeks following the promotion it will be trading far below its closing price of  on october   business and website on page f of the companys most recent q it reads petroterra corp the company was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on july   the company is an independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property or property leases enabling us to explore and exploit such property that we believe may contain extractable oil andor gas the company plans to identify evaluate and acquire oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily within the united states the company has not generated any revenue to date and consequently its operations are subject to all risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise so its an oil and gas exploration company  sound straight forward enough additionally the company has a nice wellmanicured website which has a lot of pretty pictures and even a nifty interactive brochure that gives the impression that this is a small but ambitious little oil and gas exploration company however the companys website hasnt been updated since the beginning of july yet the stock price has exploded in the absence of any publicized company developments surely if something major happened the companys pr would want to keep its website updated to inform its shareholders but there isnt anything new here this isnt the only curious thing about  if we take a deeper look at the companys sec filings its clear that there is a major inconsistency between what appears on the companys website and what is possible in its financial situation financials and insider ownership ptras financials are abysmal and indicate that the company is in no position to accomplish any meaningful business goals and make it impossible to justify its current market cap of  million the companys balance sheet shows just  in cash and  in oil and gas exploration additionally the balance sheet also shows a bank overdraft of  indicating that the company owes its bank for withdrawing too much cash  not a good sign the statement of operations and statement of cash flows are equally depressing and show a net loss of  and  cash used in the companys operations the companys statement of cash flows also shows that the company received  from the sale of common stock in light of these financial figures it comes as no surprise that the companys accounting firm as inserted a going concern statement into page  of the most recent q which reads the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future the company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of june   and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities which have arisen from normal business operations as they come due management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand loans from our director andor private placements of common stock if one looks at the executive compensation section on page  of the most recent k it shows that the ceo received a salary of  in  perhaps this explains why the company plans to continue to fund its operations through the sale of stock and may explain the companys bank overdraft additionally the companys latest k filed on june   states that the company only has one fulltime employee and none of the filings since then indicate that the company has gone on a hiring spree beyond that over  of the companys outstanding shares are held by the ceo promotion as mentioned before ptra has been promoted through a series of paid promotional emails from wall street report which also set up a colorful landing page a third party identified as mass peak ltd disclosed paying  for the promotional emails while there is no mention of mass peak ltd in ptras filings its clear that somebody is trying to create a market likely in order to unload his or her shares following these promotions ptra stock rose from  at the end of october th to close at  on october  volume increased accordingly as the average month trading volume of the companys stock is just over  and just over  shares were exchanged on october  most recently the wall street report promoted black stallion oil  gas otcqbblkg another poorly capitalized entity that has since plummeted from when the promotion came out conclusion ptra is yet another example of a paid promotion that touts massive potential for unsuspecting investors but the product being advertised has no substance the companys filings have all of the red flags that i could imagine abysmal financials hardly any employees and massive insider ownership while there is no certain link between ptras management and the promotional activity its clear that a major shareholder is looking to unload his or her shares on to unsuspecting retail investors the stock is worth nearly nothing and over the course of the next several months i fully expect that ptra stock will be trading far below its current price of  disclosure

development stage company that plans to identify evaluate and acquire oil and gas exploration and development opportunities primarily in the united states   we were incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on july   as “loran connection corp” we were formed to provide a variety of services in the area of individual and group tourism and business support in ukraine we subsequently filed a resale registration statement with the securities and exchange commission on may   which was declared effective on october     on january   we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation to among other things change our name to “petroterra corp” we changed our name to reflect a proposed change in our business operations   on october   in connection with a change of control in the management of the company the company began its current business operations in the oil and gas sector   on april   we completed our acquisition of certain property leases held by ardmore investments inc for property owned by pioneer oil and gas covering  acres of land located in the central utah thrust belt in beaver county and sevier county utah the “utah properties”   on july   we filed a certificate of change to effect a  for  reverse stock split of our authorized and our outstanding shares of common stock and preferred stock   our principal executive offices are located at  east vermijo avenue suite  colorado springs co  the telephone number at our principal executive offices is   our web site is wwwpetroterracorpcom        current business operations   the company is an independent exploration and development company focused on the acquisition of property or property leases enabling us to explore and exploit such property that we believe may contain extractable oil andor gas we will seek to acquire property in the united states and will initially focus on properties in the central utah thrust belt including the utah properties   in order to determine whether to acquire a property our management team will consider among other things whether oil andor gas had previously been discovered at or near the property whether the property is located atop a proven oil and natural gas basin and whether oil andor gas has been exploited from the property we will also review any materials that are made available to us by the owner of the property including well logs production records and other seismic geological and geophysical information additionally we will compare analogues of successes and failures from seismic and drilling data in the region once we have completed our initial review we will determine whether to acquire the property once we acquire a property or the right to explore and exploit a property we will conduct a full evaluation of the property including without limitation obtaining an mha petroleum consultants llc technical report an “mha technical report” we expect that the cost of such an evaluation will be approximately  using the data from the evaluation and with the assistance of third party geophysicists petroleum engineers geologists and other third party technical consultants that we may hire we will determine whether further exploration of the property should be undertaken if management elects to continue the exploration of the property we will conduct additional due diligence including but not limited to potentially obtaining existing d seismic lines on and around our properties and commencing an integrated geologicgeophysical evaluation and mapping effort following our due diligence analysis management will determine if the company should attempt to conduct its own d or d seismic coverage to evaluate the properties further thereafter management will determine if the company should attempt to extract oil andor gas from the property if management elects to do so we will engage a separate third party to extract whether by conventional means horizontal drilling andor fracturing the oil andor gas we expect that recent improvements in drilling and fracturing methods will augment our ability to discover and extract oil and gas   by utilizing this business model we believe that we can reduce the risks involved in each exploration project specifically we believe that by compartmentalizing each step of the extraction process we will be able to limit the costs associated with each project and maintain the flexibility to abandon any projects that management believes will not yield sufficient amounts of oil andor gas   in january  we hired a third party independent contractor to provide insight and to assist in the development of a plan regarding the exploration of any properties that we acquire in march  we engaged a third party independent contractor to provide geologic consulting services to the company in march  we also obtained an mha technical report on the utah properties in september  we engaged a third party independent contractor to review and process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased utah properties in november  we engaged a third party independent contractor to perform a comprehensive gravity survey on our utah properties which was completed in december  and the results of such survey were interpreted in february  we have since engaged a third party contractor to create a geologic model of the utah properties each of the foregoing actions have been implemented as part of our continuing effort to conduct a full evaluation of the utah properties for more information see “recent developments” below   recent developments   on november   the company entered into the agreement whereby ardmore assigned to us its rights under a certain purchase agreement dated august   between ardmore and pioneer involving the sale of  acres of three separate blm management oil and gas leases located in the central utah thrust belt in beaver county and sevier county utah and currently owned by pioneer per the terms of the agreement we issued to ardmore  shares of our common stock on november   and in order to complete the assignment contemplated by the agreement we issued to ardmore an additional  shares

process both the public domain gravity and aeromagnetic datasets that existed on our leased utah properties the purpose of this review was to identify major structures and geologic trends of interest on the utah properties based on the results of this analysis on november   the company engaged magee geophysical services llc “magee” to perform a comprehensive gravity survey on our utah properties the gravity survey was conducted from november   through december   and cost the company approximately  pursuant to the survey a total of  new gravity stations were identified on a nominal quarter mile grid and the data acquired was merged with reprocessed public domain data including about  stations located in and around the main grid upon completion of magee’s gravity survey on december   the company engaged thompson to further process the data obtained by magee and to provide custom processing and mapping of such data on february   thompson completed their interpretation of the gravity survey the company will pay to thompson  for its services   on february   the company engaged prisem geoscience consulting llc “prisem” to provide recommendations on a work plan for creating a geologic model of the utah properties this structural analysis will include but not be limited to collecting well data from relevant wells in the area and construction of possibly  to  balanced cross sections through andor near the prospective acreage prisem will also make a seismic database search and provide recommendations for licensing of existing d datasets if seismic data is purchased prisem will recommend processors to reprocess the data using modern techniques relevant to complex structural environment as the utah properties   the company initiated these technical steps in line with our business plan of evaluating our properties step by step before proceeding to the next phase of extraction the company plans to coordinate its technical efforts towards selecting an initial potential drillsite that management believes may be capable of producing oil or natural gas in commercial quantities on the utah properties   results of operations   our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue our operation   we expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through among other things the sale of equity or debt securities   three month period ended june   compared to the three month period ended june     our net loss for the threemonth period ended june   was  compared to a net loss of  during the threemonth period ended june   we did not generate any revenue during the three month period ended june   and         this change in net loss was primarily the result of the following   lease property and exploration costs   during the three months ended june   we incurred lease property and exploration costs of  a decrease of  compared to the prior year period amount

months ended june   and  respectively and have an accumulated deficit of  at june   in addition we have not completed our efforts to establish a stable recurring source of revenues sufficient to cover our operating costs and expect to continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future there is no assurances that we will be able to obtain an adequate level of financing needed for our near term requirements or the longterm development and exploration of our leases these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern”   since inception we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our common stock receiving aggregate net proceeds totaling  from the period beginning october   through june   including the current fiscal year securities purchase agreements described in more details below        securities purchase agreements   the company entered into several securities purchase agreements with a single investor pursuant

requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business        our existing working capital further advances and debt instruments and anticipated cash flow are not adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months and the company is dependent upon additional equity raises we have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements generally we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of our private placement of equity in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i development and exploration expenses through independent consultants and ii financing related costs we believe that we will need  in additional capital to meet longterm operating requirements for the next twelve months additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current stockholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities that could significantly and materially restrict our business operations we will have to raise additional funds in the next twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations we currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding however we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock we have and will continue to seek to obtain shortterm loans from our director although no future
