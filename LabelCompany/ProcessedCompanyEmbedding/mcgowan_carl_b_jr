and greek origins of the word ie meaning to ‘plunder’ or ‘kidnap’ an australian vicechancellor was recently asked to resign following public allegations and findings of his plagiarism universities adopt and publicise policies to illustrate what they expect from their students we posit that while some students plagiarise for reasons endogenous to those students others do so as a result of poorly designed and constructed assignments and assessment tasks from a simple example involving the use of the plagiarism detection software program “turnitin” and  nd year accounting students’ essays we find the demonstrated level of ‘originality’ and ‘research’ as acceptable for the task the students had been set however we conclude that those responsible for formulating and setting assessment tasks require greater consideration of issues of cognitive development and complexityp httpsworksbepresscomcarlbmcgowanjrno subject areaevaluating the impact of a rapidly changing economic environment of
