to make our world a better place we call it fig talk and hope that you will join us investing in fig food posted on march   by joel investing in fig food offers a tangible step to meaningfully change your health your environment and your future two stories running sidebyside in yesterday’s  wall street journal crystallized that for me one story highlighted the link uncovered by the who between glyphosate “roundup” and cancer and monsanto’s the creator of roundup vociferous disagreement with the findings as is too often the case monsanto sought to discredit the findings with hyperbole rather than substantive counter arguments fig food’s focus on north american organic agriculture offers an alternative to glyphosatedriven agriculture and we need your help organic planted acreage is declining in the united states due to the political clout of companies like monsanto you can make a difference by investing in fig food co companies committed to organic agricultural practices adjacent to the glyphosate article was an article entitled “’eat right’ meltdown for kraft singles” the article noted the controversy about the use of the academy of nutrition and dietetics’ “kids eat right” logo on kraft singles as jon stewart joked “the academy of nutrition and dietetics is an academy in the same way this is cheese” pointing to a package of kraft singles i am not calling into question the seriousness of this academy i am pointing out that our food system is under siege with misinformation and one of the best ways to confront this siege is by investing in fig food we seek not only to succeed with our line of plantbased organic food but also through educating and advocating for healthy eating and organic agriculture please let me know of any thoughts or comments i

health is at stake we’re not being dramatic the personal well being of each individual as well as that of the planet is at risk – and we’ve moved well past the point of debate it is time to return to practicing a few things the way we did before the advent of processed food and industrialized agriculture  we need to slow down and place far greater value on conscious eating rather than eating based on convenience and cost real systemic change starts with each individual and our everyday choices perhaps the most fundamental of human activities food requires decisionmaking which impacts our personal health and the environment food affects our economy and supply chain – but more than that it shapes our values and approach to living life we’ve entered an era where for all the right reasons consumers are asking the hard questions how and where our food is grown how it is prepared whether or not anything has been added to it a more holistic mindset is emerging and changing how people approach food this includes where people choose to invest their time and resources in quality wholesome ingredients and food preparation the organic lifestyle slow cooking movement efforts to lower our carbon footprint and personalprivategovernmental sustainability trends are redefining our culture and here to stay fig food co becomes bcorporation certified posted on july  august   by admin why bcorp matters certified b corporations are leading a global movement to redefine success in business by voluntarily meeting higher standards of transparency accountability and performance certified b corps are distinguishing themselves in a cluttered marketplace by offering a positive vision of a better way to do business we hope that you are inspired not just by our vision but by the movement’s ability to translate ideas into action b corps create higher quality jobs and improve the quality of life in our communities and as the movement grows it has become an increasingly powerful agent of change we are passing laws we are driving capital government and the nonprofit sector are necessary but insufficient to address society’s greatest challenges business the most powerful manmade force on the planet must create value for society not just shareholders systemic challenges require systemic solutions and the b corp movement offers a concrete marketbased and scalable solution over  businesses have already joined our community encouraging all companies to compete not just to be the best in the world but to be the best for the world as a result of our collective success individuals and communities will enjoy greater economic opportunity society will address its most challenging environmental problems and more people will find fulfillment by bringing their whole selves to work   “what the corporation was to baby boomers the b corp is to millennials the place to work” – salon “b corporations are a way to transcend the contradictions between the ineffective parts of the social sector and myopic capitalism” – new york times “think of it this way usda certifies organic foods and good housekeeping puts its seal of approval on quality products like washing machines and skillets and since  a nonprofit organization called b lab has been certifying corporations it deems to be concerned about their communities and the environment” – npr   statistics  there

some training involved naturally thats usually the case with everything the actual interview was probably the briefest ive ever been through in my life needless to say i left with a bad feeling about it they asked me questions about my previous experience as a project coordinator which i answered pretty directlythis situation felt like the textbook problem of hr and staffers not knowing about the
