work  drones reporting for work like the internet and gps before them drones are evolving beyond their military origin to become powerful business tools they’ve already made the leap to the consumer market and now theyre being put to work in commercial and civil government applications from firefighting to farming that’s creating a market opportunity thats too large to ignore the opportunity ahead between now and  we forecast a  billion market opportunity for drones—helped by growing demand from the commercial and civil government sectors source goldman sachs research military drones got their start as safer cheaper and often more capable alternatives to manned military aircraft defense will remain the largest market for the foreseeable future as global competition heats up and technology continues to improve source goldman sachs research consumer the consumer drone market was the first to develop outside the military demand has taken off in the last two years and hobbyist drones have become a familiar sight but there is plenty of room for growth source goldman sachs research commercialcivil the fastest growth opportunity comes from businesses and civil governments theyre just beginning to explore the possibilities but we expect theyll spend  billion on drones between now and  putting thousands of them in the sky heres where you might see them source goldman

wildfire has broken out and is spreading rapidly local firefighters want to conduct a water drop over the hottest parts of the blaze but they need to give the helicopter pilot the coordinates a drone equipped with a thermal camera can fly over the scene and identify the hot spots a day in the life of a commercial drone airborne inspection an oil and gas company is about to conduct its required monthly pipeline inspection the company would usually hire a anhour helicopter crew for the job but now theyre using a drone a drone can survey  miles of pipeline per day – on par with the helicopter crew but at a lower cost but these benefits depend on regulators allowing drone operations beyond a pilots line of sight pipeline inspection isnt unique in this regard — most commercial applications will require or benefit from more relaxed flight regulations take agriculture for example a day in the life of a commercial drone crop circles a farmer decides to hire a drone to monitor his crops during the critical summer growing season at current altitude restrictions it could inspect up to  acres of farmland a day turning around surveys faster and more accurately than planes or satellites if regulators were to increase the maximum flight height by just  the drone could double the farmer’s daily coverage drones for all the consumer market flight speed dramatic photography – it’s easy to see why drones appeal to consumers this is the largest nonmilitary market today and it’s still in its early stages early stages the global consumer drone market is still a fraction of the size of other highend consumer electronics a small relative market market units of consumer electronics products e retail drones  action cameras  smart wearables  videogame consoles  tablets  source company

gathering or chemical detection  one of the biggest drones is wider than a commercial jet  one of the smallest is half the size of a blue jay comparing wingspans it’s a bird it’s a plane todays soldiers work with drones of all sizes — from small stealthy quadcopters the size of a bird to large jetsized aircraft source goldman sachs research growing capability set current drone technology has already surpassed manned aircraft in endurance range safety and cost efficiency — but research and development is far from over the next generation of drones will widen the gap between manned and unmanned flight even further adding greater stealth sensory payload range autonomous and communications capabilities source goldman sachs research the really big picture drone sensor technology currently in development can map  million square miles in a single flight – nearly the area of the  contiguous us states san francisco chicago  going global across the globe demand is increasing for

growth of the drone industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use this uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption but anticipated regulatory clarity should unlock demand nasa is leading a multibilliondollar effort to develop a us airspace management system capable of safely coordinating manned and unmanned flight while the federal aviation administration faa is expected to further ease restrictions that are keeping commercial drones from reaching their full potential range drone flight is currently limited to a pilots line of sight beyond line of sight  feet current faa regulations whats needed to unlock commercial demand altitude drones cannot fly over  feet flight above  feet operations drones cannot operate over people and must be flown by someone with a remote pilot certificate autonomous operations allowed along with flight over populated areas the takeaway with the evolution of regulations we see drones headed for new heights in the business world the same safety efficiency and cost benefits that appeal to the military make drones attractive for a wide range of business and civil government functions the  billion market opportunity we forecast over the next five years is just the tip of the iceberg drones full economic potential is likely to be multiple times that number as their ripple effects

vehicle autopilot and the operator interface the ground control station drone aviation’s raptor flight control system comprises the georgia institute of technology’s gust autopilot and the dac developed gcs autopilot the raptor onboard autopilot gust executes on standard intel i i i single board computing architecture raptor is not performance constrained as are many flight control systems operating on proprietary difficult to upgrade hardware being able to rapidly increase computing power allows for mission expansion using capabilities such as gpsdenied vision navigation target recognition and neural network vehicle control commercially licensed exclusively to dac gust is an extensible software platform for full vehicle and environment simulation onboard dynamic vehicle flight control autopilot and sensorfusion navigation gust is mature technology with  years of research and operational experience and continues to be improved and expanded by georgia tech and drone aviation ground control station gcs the raptor gcs is unique in the industry developed by dac for use in tethered systems the gcs is uncluttered by removing confusing settings and options vehicle tuning and informational windows not required for tethered systems further the raptor gcs operating system is separate from the operator’s tablet pc phone or other display and input device this abstraction layer allows the vehicle to be monitored by a central site and operated with many different types of devices locally over a secure wifi or wired ethernetfiber optic link kevlar armored

reliably and safely than freeflying unmanned aircraft unlimited flight duration from groundbased power transmit power video and other data vehicle control securely through kevlar armored tether no signal to hack tension control winch system a critical part of the watt ground support equipment the tension control winch maintains consistent tether alignment with the watt aerial vehicle as the vehicle ascends or descends the winch system rapidly adjusts when in loiter or mobility modes the tension control monitoring and adjustment system measures tether line tension hundreds of times per second read more small adjustments are made to ensure the tether does not become slack or pull on the aerial vehicle the system is fully automatic compensating for both drone operation and environmental conditions managed tension avoids slack or whipping of the tether in winds or vehicle flight changes which can result in the tether wrapping around nearby obstructions further the vehicle is more stable when the tether tension is actively managed as the tether is not inconsistently pulling on the vehicle advantages more stable vehicle flight resulting in better video and higher accuracy stationkeeping safer operation especially in windy conditions or mobile operations winch is designed to allow safe recovery of aerial vehicle accessible mobile reliable about drone aviation
