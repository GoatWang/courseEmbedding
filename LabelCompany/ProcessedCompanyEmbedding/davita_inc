function declines protein waste and minerals become hard to remove and diseased kidneys must work harder to get rid of them each person’s kidney diet prescription is different but the main nutrients limited in kidney diets include protein phosphorus potassium and sodium read on to enhance your kidneyfriendly food iq wise up with water choose tap or plain bottled water mineral water or flavored sparkling water specialty waters may be enhanced with sodium potassium or phosphate additives choose your brew homebrewed tea and homemade lemonade are ideal alternatives to water some bottled or canned beverages are loaded with phosphates so it’s better to limit them pick your poultry choose fresh poultry and pork many enhanced and precooked products including broth nuggets and strips contain greater amounts of sodium phosphate and potassium additives go organic make homemade lowsodium soup with organic or homemade stock tap into your vegetarian side eat meatless meals or plan entrées that use modest amounts of meat to reduce protein and thus added stress on your kidneys meatless meals have fewer saturated fats to boot which is good news for your heart some cheese please select strongflavored natural cheesesand limit the amount you eat to  ounces to help decrease your intake of saturated fat cholesterol sodium and phosphorus “a” is for antioxidants eat antioxidantrichapples berries cherries red grapes cabbage cauliflower garlic onions and red bell peppers to help decrease chronic inflammation associated with kidney disease cardiovascular disease and cancer power up with protein choose egg whites and high omega fish as your protein source regardless of your protein level plan at least half from highquality sources such as these to receive all the essential amino acids
