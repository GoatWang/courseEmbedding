lump sum or through periodic contributions and in return receive regular payments for life or for a stated period of time the money grows on a taxdeferred basis until you begin receiving it typically after age   annuities are especially appealing during your retirement years because they help offer protection against outliving your assets annuities are often confused with life insurance but they are not the same once an annuity is converted into payments annuitized it can provide a steady stream of income while you are alive a life insurance policy pays off upon your death and benefits your heirs annuities differ from cds and government bonds as well since they are not federally insured or guaranteed with an annuity you must depend on the financial strength of the insurance company insurance company financial strength is rated by various service companies such as am best or moodys you may want to consider only those insurance companies that carry an a or a rating there are two basic types of annuities fixed and variable fixed annuities fixed annuities can pay a fixed rate of interest for a certain period usually one to five years after the guarantee period is over your assets are automatically rolled over for a new time period at a new rate the new rate will have moved up or down depending on the general direction of interest rates most fixed annuities have a floor or guarantee below which your return will not drop this floor often tied to the treasury bill rate or other index lasts the life of the annuity in general a fixed annuity is characterized by taxdeferred fixed interest rates during the accumulation growth phase fixed payments during the income distribution phase return of principal the amount you invested guaranteed by the insurance company the ability for the insurance company to meet these obligations to policyholders are subject to sufficient capital liquidity cash flow and other resources of the insurance company riskreturn fixed annuities generally offer a lower return than variable annuities but also carry a lower level of risk there are several hybrids of fixed annuities to choose from including the market value adjusted annuity mva the single premium deferred annuity spda the cdtype annuity and the fixed index annuity variable annuities variable annuities are essentially an insurance contract combined with an investment product through a professionally managed subaccount similar to a mutual fund portfolio within your variable annuity you invest in stocks bonds or money market funds or a combination thereof depending on market fluctuations the performance of these investments will vary hence leading to a variable return on the annuity the insurance company does not guarantee a specified rate of return nor does it guarantee a return of the principal your return could potentially be higher than a fixed annuity but your risk is higher too in general a variable annuity is characterized by variable rates of return during the accumulation growth phase principal not guaranteed by the insurance company payments that vary depending on the performance of the underlying investment options death benefit most variable annuities provide a guaranteed death benefit this assures that the owners heirs will receive at least the sum of all premiums paid less any withdrawals more liberal guaranteed death benefits may be available an added risk protection is that variable annuity assets are held in a separate account of the insurance company thus the assets are more protected from the claims of the insurance companys creditors the separate account of a variable annuity is not a mutual fund while separate accounts may have a name similar to a mutual fund it is not the same pool of funds and will experience different performance than the mutual fund of the same or similar name in addition the financial ratings of the issuing insurance company do not apply to any nonguaranteed separate accounts the value of the separate accounts that are not guaranteed will fluctuate in response to the market changes and other factors at a glance fixed vs variable annuities fixed variable investors principal guaranteed by the insurance company not guaranteed but usually pays a minimum death benefit rate of return fixed minimum rate for life of contract additional interest credited periodically varies depending on portfolio performance investment options none investor has multiple choices investment risk insurer is at risk investor is at risk where assets held insurance company general account insurance company separate account so less exposure to companys creditors accessing your annuity for most tax types it is more advantageous not to take payments from an annuity until the age of   there are several ways your money can be returned to you lump sum regular monthly payments for a specified period of time or lifetime income for you and your spouse annuity payments vary depending on amount you have contributed your age length of time your money has been compounding rate of return on the portfolios if you dont need the income stream your annuity can provide it can pass to your beneficiaries outside the probate process although the proceeds will be taxable to them penalties and surrender charges taking payments from your annuity before age   can be expensive since the irs imposes a  penalty on the monies withdrawn in most cases due to the  irs penalty for money taken out before you reach age   most insurance companies allow you to withdraw up to  of your assets before they impose a surrender charge the combination of surrender charges and a possible  penalty means that you may want to view an annuity as a longterm investment × you are now leaving
