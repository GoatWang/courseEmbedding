offer his customers a little “something for nothing” in  william wrigley jr came to chicago with  in his pocket and a check from his uncle for  to start a new business a bold entrepreneur the year was  and the businessman was william wrigley jr born in philadelphia wrigley jr had moved to chicago and was selling necessities like soap and baking powder when he noticed a rather curious trend the sticks of gum he was giving away for free as incentives were proving more popular than the merchandise itself a born entrepreneur with a knack for identifying opportunities where others only saw risk wrigley jr quickly directed his prodigious energies toward producing his own line of gums one of his first aims was to combat the lingering stereotype that only women should chew gum two of the company’s earliest products — sweet sixteen orange and lotta gum —revolutionized chewing gum’s appeal spreading interest to the youth market and then to the public at large in  during an economic depression he introduced two brands that would become company icons wrigley’s spearmint® and juicy fruit® and when an even more debilitating economic downturn arrived in  wrigley did the unthinkable mortgaging everything he owned to launch a massive advertising campaign a move that skyrocketed the company into national prominence and set the stage for the company’s future groundbreaking advertising strategies a legacy of business leadership during his company’s meteoric rise wrigley jr established himself as one of the nation’s leading champions of employee rights and benefits creating a health and welfare department in wrigley’s chicago factory in  and granting his employees both saturdays and sundays off in  during the great depression the company went one step further boldly setting minimum wage levels so its workers could have financial security during one of the nation’s darkest hours wrigley employees during the early th century enjoyed benefits available to few other contemporary factory workers wrigley jr is also remembered as the father of modern advertising coining the familiar maxim “tell ’em quick and tell ’em often” in  he organized the firstever nationwide direct marketing campaign shipping sticks of gum to every address listed in us phone books but it was wrigley jr’s son philip named company president in  who artfully expanded the company’s reach even further by sponsoring radio programs and pioneering the placement of ads in the “funny pages” of newspapers from  to  the company would harness the clean airbrushed style of artist otis

introduced new brands including big red® and freedent® while pursuing the opportunity for international expansion the company opened new production facilities in nine countries between  and  including

thomas adams william wrigley walter diemer advertising impact bibliography endnotes list of media william wrigley perhaps one of the most famous names in the gum industry is william wrigley  wrigley was the son of a soap salesman from philadelphia and at the age of thirteen he was also selling soap  at the age of  he moved to chicago to open a new branch of his father’s company and came up with an idea to provide “premiums” to vendors who purchased a certain amount of soap  these premiums included baking powder cookbooks and umbrellas   the baking powder sales surpassed the popularity of the soap so wrigley made that his primary product and offered gum as a premium the very same development from john curtis  once again the premium’s popularity surpassed that of the product and wrigley entered the gum industry  wrigley hired the zero gum company to manufacture gum for him and it was here that the wrigley’s industry started  he introduced a series of branded gums in  including juicy fruit and spearmint  in  he founded william wrigley jr company    william wrigley jr while this type of industrymaking is nothing new or special what set wrigley apart from his competitors including the adams company was his marketing and advertising  wrigley is famously quoted as saying “anyone can make gum the trick is to sell it”  and sell it he did  wrigley began by doing a modest advertising campaign in  in buffalo rochester and syracuse with successful results  the campaign then evolved to massive billboards placards in streetcars and subways and one of the first electric signs including a massive one in times square the electricity bill of which was an annual   the billboards then evolved to a linked line of  signs along the railroad between atlantic city and trenton new jersey advertising wrigley’s spearmint  between  and  wrigley sent free samples of gum to everyone with a telephone book a total of more than  million and in another campaign every child received two sticks of gum when they turned two reaching  children   a brandrecognition study in the s found that  of people listed wrigley as their “topofmind” choice for chewing gum while the nearest competitor scored

down their advertising appropriations he considered it to be the very time and opportunity to increase them the bigger his business grew the more necessary he believed it to be to talk to the public about his product he is still talking about it wherever there are newspapers and billboards you will find the familiar symbol of the wrigley product the small coins of a score of different currencies flow into the wrigley coffers and dimes grow to dollars and dollars to millions but william wrigley jr is convinced the flow would dwindle and soon dry up if the spearhead and the slogan failed to appear daily as a reminder to old patrons and a persuader for new the name of william wrigley jr is a household word in america in europe and the orient and in the remote islands of the seven seas they have heard it everywhere it is linked in the public mind with the spearhead emblem of his product “the flavor lasts” is a slogan which h as been translated into many tongues and tested by millions of people it is not mere idle curiosity which makes people interested in the personality behind a great commercial success or in the methods by which the success was achieved any man who finds his way by enterprise courage and hard work to the goal of affluence will command the observation of his fellows and they want to know how he did it the secret of william wrigley jr’s success is symbolized by the white tower which stands at the very gateway to chicago’s throbbing teeming commercial center it soars above the murky city— a thing of utility and loveliness when the evening darkness falls upon the busy streets it can be seen against the sky—a pinnacle of almost ethereal beauty bathed in the soft radiance of electric light this is the tower which wrigley built when success had come to him it is an extraordinary combination of the practical and the idealistic of actuality and imagination this combination is the secret of the wrigley achievement there are two things william wrigley jr said when interviewed which sustain this interpretation “i believe in the other fellow’s right to live i cannot expect to do well in my business unless he is able to do well in his business” that is the substance of the practical idealism which has ruled the commercial methods of william wrigley “did you find my name anywhere on this building did you find any mention of spearmint on its outside walls” he asked “people thought when i began to put this up that i would plaster my name all over it in letters big enough to be seen miles away if you look when you go out you will find it in small letters over the front door—but you may have to look twice” he chuckled “as a matter of fact it was better advertising not to plaster my name on the building people talk more about it it is the unusual thing—the thing they didn’t expect me to do” and there you have the combination of actuality and imagination the building is the substantial actuality commanding attention everywhere but it was imagination approaching genius which saw there was more to be gained by allowing it to tell its own story than by turning it into a billboard  underwood  underwood the wrigley building which symbolizes the owner’s secret of success the practical idealism of the man created a building in which it is a joy to work not for himself alone but for all p those associated with him in his business from heads of departments to the elevator starter in the methods which found their permanent monument in the wrigley tower his practical idealism won the cooperation and good will of those with whom he dealt he gave his customers good reason to be interested in the success of william wrigley jr and so they helped to make it an imagination which never lost touch with actuality carried him into boldly conceived plans for storming the world with publicity condensed the secret of his achievement in gaining the patronage of multimillions may be put in the following formula “make a good product for a fair price—then tell the world” but let him tell his own story at a guess you would put him on the under side of fifty—and you would guess wrong he suggests energy tenacity persistence he is utterly without affectation there is humor in his eye and a short crisp directness in his speech “i was a city boy” he said “born in philadelphia fiftyeight years ago i earned my first money taking care of a horse and i got fifty cents a month i was only nine years old and too small to clean it but i could feed it i went to the public school and every few weeks i was fired for getting into mischief the principal said he liked me but he just couldn’t keep school while i was in it i ran away when  was eleven and went to new york—sold newspapers worked on a sailing vessel two of ‘em and then went back home and to school again i might have stayed in school—i was in the senior grammar class—if i had not thought one day that an overripe pie was a fitting decoration for the nameplate on the school building while one of my companions held my heels i leaned over and did an artistic job of p plastering it that was too much for the principal “my father was a manufacturer of scouring soap he put me to work in his factory i had to stir the soap in a big pot it was not an interesting job so when i was thirteen i asked father to make me a salesman with some persuasion he agreed to try me out i guess i made good and that was the beginning of my interest in salesmanship i learned a lot in the next few years when i was nineteen i lit out with a chum for the west we were headed for colorado but i lost my hat and our tickets out of the window of the train and we were stranded in kansas city i got a job in a restaurant and later took to selling rubber stamps then with a new outfit of clothes and presents for the folks i headed home again and went once more to selling soap “in the spring of  i came to chicago with thirtytwo dollars and my experience i rented desk room in an office on east kinzie street and tried to sell more soap to chicago it was hard going for a while then i hit on the notion of offering the merchant the premium of an umbrella with every box of soap raising the retail price to ten cents a cake and giving him at the same time a bigger margin of profit it worked “since then i have had varied experiences with premiums i have both made and lost many thousands of dollars through their use a fellow can’t always guess right but the balance in the end is on the right side “i got into my present business through using chewing gum as a premium with baking powder the gum became more popular than the baking powder so i dropped the latter and concentrated my attention on the gum then i used premiums with the gum i gave scales to every grocer who ordered fifteen dollars’ worth of gum it was a good guess this time i added other articles that would appeal to a grocer i kept looking for opportunities to advertise my gum and get it before the people other manufacturers were advertising gum as a help to digestion i saw that mine was displayed on the cash desks of restaurants where patrons would see it when paying their checks after they had eaten “then i began advertising i tried out billboards in the south in  i decided to storm new york with publicity i spent  and hardly made a ripple it was money dropped into a hole so far as anyone could see i waited until i had another  and tried it again with the same result i tried a third time after recuperating and this time with a quarter of a million i wanted to get the dropped  back i

william wrigley jr was born in philadelphia pennsylvania on september   his parents william and mary a ladley were second generation americans the wrigley family traced its roots back to saddleworth a manufacturing town north of yorkshire in england the boys greatgrandfather edmund was a woolen manufacturer in the city of brotherly love while his father went on to greater success as a soapmaker in  william sr founded and served as president of the wrigley manufacturing company the main product was wrigleys scouring soapthe younger wrigley took an immediate interest in his fathers soap business which opened as the public began viewing soap as a consumer good a year after the plant opened the boy went out into the streets of philadelphia and sold soap from a basket catching the sales bug wrigley and a friend ran away to new york a year later wrigley supported himself by doing a number of odd jobs and selling newspapersin the late th century rough and tumble new york city was no place for small little boys the two returned home a few weeks later constantly in trouble at school wrigley left permanently by some reports he was expelled and went to work in his fathers factory he stirred a vat of liquid soap for  a week as he learned the business he moved into a regional sales job either traveling by train throughout the eastern states or selling soap from a bright red wagon with four horses and bellsgo west young manwrigley again tried to establish himself away from his fathers business at the age of  he went west but lost his railroad ticket in kansas city eventually he made it back to philadelphia and william srs factory he continued in the business for more than a decade before leaving againin  after working in the soap business for  years wrigley moved to chicago at the age of  with his wife ada and young daughter dorothy to go into business for himself he planned to sell soap in chicago for his fathers company and offer baking powder as a premium for the rest of his business life wrigley advocated giving a bonus with each purchase everybody likes something extra for nothing he often saidalthough wrigley arrived in chicago with only  dollars in his pocket he secured a  loan from an uncle on the condition that his cousin become wrigleys business partner when he realized that customers were more interested in getting the baking powder than soap wrigley and his partner quickly switched to the baking powder business looking for another premium to offer wrigley turned to chewing gum this product had become popular in the s after new york inventor thomas adams introduced chicle to the united states after a visit with the former mexican dictator santa anna who chewed the stuff while they spokechewing gum for the worldwrigley gave away two packages of chewing gum with each baking soda purchase until he once again grasped that the premium was more popular than the product in  wrigley chewing gum offered its first two brands lotta gum and vassar gradually he phased out baking powder and soap and concentrated on chewing gumthe chewing gum business was highly competitive in the late s there were at least a dozen companies pushing their wares in  the six largest companies merged to form the chewing gum trust although a newcomer to the industry wrigley was offered a place in the trust but he refused under relentless competition wrigley teetered on the verge of bankruptcy several times but plowed ahead nonetheless a natural promoter wrigley realized the power of advertising much of his companys budget focused on selling the product through advertisements and gimmicks wrigley himself did much of the selling in the early days and had a knack for understanding the customers needs he expanded his premium offers giving away items ranging from lamps and razors to cookbooks and fishing tackle the premium system worked so well that wrigley even published premium catalogs to help customers choose what they wantedwrigley used every form of advertising at his disposal in his companys ads wrigley repeatedly told people about the benefits of the product he bought space in newspapers magazines and even outdoor posters his motto was tell em quick and tell em oftenin  and  wrigley introduced the flavors that would make the company eternal juicy fruit and wrigleys spearmint the enterprising wrigley even designed the logo on the spearmint package he decided the company would concentrate on popularizing spearmint which no company had been able to achieve the general public did not accept spearmint at first however wrigley believed in it and pushed it relentlessly in  a depression year wrigley spent  in advertising mostly on spearmint and with that much was able to buy over  million worth of advertising in cashstrapped new york the gamble paid off when sales jumped dramatically company revenue topped  million in  and a year later wrigleys spearmint was the top selling gum in the united states he introduced doublemint gum in in short order wrigley became the biggest gum manufacturer in the world he bought zero company in  which had been making wrigleys gum since  from that point forward the newly named william wrigley jr company manufactured its own products even as the company grew into a major corporation wrigley emphasized quality he often recited his basic philosophy even in a little thing like a stick of gum quality is importantwrigley also moved quickly into foreign nations he established gum companies in canada in  then followed that factory with ones in australia  great britain  and new zealand  still relying heavily on advertising wrigley sold gum in nations around the world in  separate languages by the time of his death in  the global sales pushed company revenues to  million with a profit of  million countries abroad had different tastes than in the united states so wrigley introduced flavors that would appeal to local customers the most successful product
