disclaimers contact wikipedia developers cookie statement mobile view reliability semiconductor  wikipedia reliability semiconductor from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search reliability of semiconductor devices can be summarized as follows semiconductor devices are very sensitive to impurities and particles therefore to manufacture these devices it is necessary to manage many processes while accurately controlling the level of impurities and particles the finished product quality depends upon the many layered relationship of each interacting substance in the semiconductor including metallization chip material list of semiconductor materials and package the problems of microprocesses and thin films and must be fully understood as they apply to metallization and wire bonding it is also necessary to analyze surface phenomena from the aspect of thin films due to the rapid advances in technology many new devices are developed using new materials and processes and design calendar time is limited due to nonrecurring engineering constraints plus time to market concerns consequently it is not possible to base new designs on the reliability of existing devices to achieve economy of scale semiconductor products are manufactured in high volume furthermore repair of finished semiconductor products is impractical therefore incorporation of reliability at the design stage and reduction of variation in the production stage have become essential reliability of semiconductor devices may depend on assembly use and environmental conditions stress factors affecting device reliability include gas dust contamination voltage current density temperature humidity mechanical stress vibration shock radiation pressure and intensity of magnetic and electrical fields design factors affecting semiconductor reliability include voltage derating power derating current derating metastability logic timing margins logic simulation timing analysis temperature derating and process control contents  methods of improvement  failure mechanisms  materialinteractioninduced mechanisms  stressinduced failure mechanisms  mechanically induced failure mechanisms  environmentally induced failure mechanisms  see also  references  bibliography methods of improvementedit reliability of semiconductors is kept high through several methods cleanrooms control impurities process control controls processing and burnin short term operation at extremes and probe and test reduce escapes probe wafer prober tests the semiconductor die prior to packaging via microprobes connected to test equipment wafer testing tests the packaged device often pre and post burnin for a set of parameters that assure operation process and design weaknesses are identified by applying a set of stress tests in the qualification phase of the semiconductors before their market introduction e g according to the aec q and q stress qualifications parts average testing is a statistical method for recognizing and quarantining semiconductor die that have a higher probability of reliability failures this technique identifies characteristics that are within specification but outside of a normal distribution for that population as atrisk outliers not suitable for high reliability applications testerbased parts average testing varieties include parametric parts average testing ppat and geographical parts average testing gpat among others inline parts average testing ipat uses data from production process control inspection and metrology to perform the outlier recognition function bond strength measurement is performed in two basic types pull testing and shear testing both can be done destructively which is more common or non destructively non destructive tests are normally used when extreme reliability is required such as in military or aerospace applications failure mechanismsedit failure mechanisms of

defined as the probability that a product system or service will perform its intended function adequately for a specified period of time operating in a defined operating environment without failure components of this definition probability the likelihood of mission success intended function for example to light cut rotate or heat satisfactory perform according to a specification with an acceptable degree of compliance specific period of time minutes days months or number of cycles specified conditions for example temperature speed or pressure stated another way reliability is probability of success durability dependability quality over time availability to perform a function common examples “this car is under warranty for  miles or  years whichever comes first” “this mower

japan go consumer reports apple still tops in reliability in its recentlyreleased holiday buying issue consumer reports says that imac and macbook lines still reign over pc competitors but a close reading of the results show a mixed result for cupertino by david morgenstern for the apple core  november     gmt  pst  topic apple  the consumer reports cover story looked at best brands in electronics the reliability section was based on consumer reports annual product reliability survey and reported on computers from acer apple dell emachines gateway hewlettpackard lenovo sony and toshiba in the ranking of consumer satisfaction apple gets a reader score of  percent dell and lenovo tied at  percent with acer asus emachines hp gateway and toshiba grouped together between  to  percent thats a significant difference in customer perception the reasons still appear to bewilder pc makers these vendors have spent years driving to the bottom of a commodity market where brands vie almost totally on cost however over the past five or so years customers have increasingly accepted apples value proposition higherquality machines with leading industrial design a tightlyintegrated operating system and the introduction of new technologies that come with higher price tags apple sold over  million macs last quarter and  percent of them were macbooks and then there are the provision of tech support and its costs tech support in general is among the lowestrated services in all of the surveys conducted by the consumer reports national research center but that doesnt apply to apple which beat all the makers of windowsbased pcs covered in our most recent survey cr said that apple solved threequarters of user problems compared with dells  percent its nearest competitor so the others must have scored worse in the reliability ratings for desktop computers apples imac repair rate  percent scored significantly better than hp  dell  and gateway  this score cant be a surprise to anyone if you spend years removing cost — read quality — out of any system here desktop systems there will come a point where all the little things add up to a big whole which in this case stinks meanwhile apple has made its imac allinone desktop the focus of its performance computing strategy apples traditional desktop computer the mac pro is missing in action right now way overdue for a refresh theres no way of knowing if these quality reports are just about hardware failures or are also software related is it related to the crapware that comes with pcs in an attempt to eke out a bit more margin in a commodity product hard to tell heres an interesting piece about imac from apple ceo tim cook during the oct  apple q earnings call with analysts in terms of general shortages the imac will be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way part of that is that were beginning shipping the inch imac in november and the inch in december so there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacturer and ramp those and i expect the demand to be robust so we will have a significant shortage there however in crs laptop computer ratings apple only edged out the many pc competitors by a couple of percentage points the worst was dell with a  percent rating compared to apples  percent so i see these figures in two ways firstly that pc makers have put more effort into their laptops and theyve done a good job getting closer to apple in quality on the other hand we could say that all laptop makers apple included may be having some qa issues with their recent mobile computers this might have something to do to the increasingly thinner and smaller enclosures that make laptops difficult to assemble as well as to repair anecdotal observation i recently spoke to several mac buyers who are on a replacement machine they bought a new macbook and problems started happening they took the laptop into get it repaired and were given another machine thats good customer service see above but not so good on the repair reliability front  log in to comment my profile log out  community guidelines join discussion add your comment add your comment related

root cause analysis lead investigator series will provide analysts with a solid foundation in mechanicalelectromechanical reliability fractology and an indepth understanding about the conditions that increase the risk of human error in the workplace all of these integral skills will then be utilized within the proact® rca methodology framework and software to ensure investigations are efficient effective and successful benefits  features five workshops over a period of time that is determined by the client training workshops can be backtoback and all sequential or they can be spread over timeit is whatever works best for the client real case studies and failed parts to review presented by veteran analysts  workshop reference materials correlated to each workshop  students are encouraged to bring real time example issues to share in class and to serve as the focus of exercises upon completion and final exam  successful analysts are awarded plaques for certified proact® lead investigators workshops are available on client sites or rci training center the following workshops in this series must be completed to fulfill the requirements for the proact® root cause analysis lead investigator series proact® root cause analysis methodology proact® root cause analysis rca ® rca facilitators will learn to lead teams to analyze why undesirable events occur all the way down to their systems root causes the goal is not to pinpoint who makes poor decisions but why such decisions are made the end result is usually deficient organizational systems that promote poor decisionmaking this methodology is applicable to anyone in ehs quality reliability maintenance engineering and administration justification tools and techniques this course provides an indepth understanding of rcis failure modes  effects analysis fmea  opportunity analysis oa approach to identifying the most significant opportunities in any system the course is designed to provide a vehicle to comb existing weak operating systems in order to find the details associated with the weaknesses thereby exposing the opportunities for improvement a detailed comprehension of how to perform fmeaoa on the weak systems will be applied so the maximum bottomline results can be achieved the attendees will learn how to physically perform an fmeaoa as well as how to develop a report that details the fmea results and how to present their findings to management for review and action the course will also cover force field analysis  decision by pairs which is a technique used to prioritize a list of items in their order of importance to the decision makers the technique measures each item with all the other items to provide a structured model for determining their order of importance in the overall scope of the decision making process human error reduction human error reduction is designed to provide students with the requisite skills and knowledge necessary to effectively reduce human error in the workplace with fewer errors made by your staff you will spend less time correcting human errors and responding to consequences of human errors thus strengthening your facilitys safety culture this workshop provides the students an acute awareness to the conditions that increase the risk of human error this workshop is intended to be proactive in nature because students will be able to identify environment health and safety conditions that are high risk and implement countermeasures to reduce those risks failure scene investigation for mechanical this course provides an indepth understanding of how to verify hypotheses developed in rca hands on presentations are made to teach students how to identify mechanical failure modes by reading fracture surfaces this workshop can be customized per client interest and focus for instance the client can chose to focus on bearings gears and fans or they may wish to focus on seals shafts and fasteners many of the root causes of failures and risks lie in the mechanical reliability of equipment and components this workshop will educate the students with a much deeper understanding of the material sciences and their role in failure lead investigator facilitation  mentoring this workshop will take all the knowledge learned from the past  workshops and put them together to solve specific issues these issues will be identified using the fmea and oa tools learned the most important and highest roi events will then be analyzed using the proact rca methodology and software the result will be an instant pay back for the investment in the training itself proact® software and knowledge management templates failure analysts require a consistent structured approach to conducting their investigations including a software component in this process will guide the analyst through the analysis and also prepare management reports of the findings and recommendations additionally it will cut analysis time by as much as  the proact suite contains the following leap® fmeaoa software ® this software provides a disciplined approach to documenting and communicating a failure modes and effects analysis fmea and an opportunity analysis oa while the fmea allows for compliance to regulatory guidelines oa will allow the users to explore trends for chronic events that are the most prudent to conduct root cause analyses on leap also will record all of these analyses in a common database that can be searched and used for future investigations proact® rca software ® this software guides and helps facilitate the disciplined rca process taught in the facilitator training this software eliminates the need for multiple programs to attain the end result proact rca software documents the rca process while dynamically compiling the report behind the scenes it also includes a builtin presentation mode proact rca software serves as a knowledge management system by storing successful rcas and their associated logic and allowing users to search and learn from them special securities allow the analyst the ability to limit permissions to the ongoing analysis and to publish the analysis for all to see when approved by legal the proact® logic tree knowledge base ® is an aggregation of over  years of experience associated with hundreds of field investigations the analyses have been thoroughly reviewed and their results compiled to form this unique single knowledge base of  rca templates encompassing five main areas operational mechanical electrical quality  human as analysts use rcis proact ® software and have exhausted their ideas for developing hypotheses there are more opportunities available with the proact ® logic tree knowledge base templates these templates provide the analyst the ability to see if there may be something they could have missed the proact ® templates provide learning based on past experience and also a system of checksandbalances for the comprehensiveness of the analysis while no knowledge base can ever cover all of the potential variables of all potential events analysts can learn from past experience to assist with preventing
