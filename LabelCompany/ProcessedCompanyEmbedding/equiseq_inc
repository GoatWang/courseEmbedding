equiseq gene test can eliminate crippling disease in horseshomepagesign in  sign uprob ingramblockedunblockfollowfollowingjul equiseq gene test can eliminate crippling disease in horsesthis is the third and final installment of a threepart series on the growing field of genomics and bioformatics in the silicon region which includes oklahoma the texas panhandle new mexico and arizona the series included an examination of genetic research being done at oklahoma’s langston university to help goat producers and a look the work of agricbioformaticslexi palmer can tell when a horse is suffering how it nips and bucks when the pain seizes up the hindquarters and the muscles begin to waste awayshe recognizes how hard it is for horse owners to look into the big brown eyes of their companion horse and not be able to communicate to their animal why it is in pain why it will always be in pain and why it will eventually die because of a muscle wasting disease that has no cure“i saw an episode and it was terrible” said palmer “you could look in the horse’s eyes and see she was tired could see she was in pain the horses are your best friends and you are so in tune with that horse so you are in pain with them it’s like watching a family member slowly deteriorate and there’s nothing you can do about it”horse owners and breeders can however now test their horses for the marker that indicates they carry the gene for polysaccharide storage myopathy type  pssm and another similar disease that are common in horses like thoroughbreds and quarter horses thanks to a new mexicobased startup called equiseq incequiseq began in february of  and for palmer the company’s yearold ceo the job is more a passion for helping the equine community than it is about making bank a horse lover and rider herself palmer said the research at equiseq is changing the horse industry in only the best ways despite some pushback from breedersresearchers at equiseq have identified a genetic variant that is associated with pssm the genetic variant alters a gene that is required in skeletal muscle before pssm could only be determined when symptoms of exercise intolerance occurred and the horses tested negative for a genetic variant of glycogen synthase associated with pssm gysrh or pdeveloping the genetic testing for this specific type of disease in horses wasn’t exactly what equiseq founder paul szauter planned to do after teaching genomics at one university he decided he would launch his own company that could quickly and cheaply sequence a genome using university of new mexico technologyhe then branched out into a business accelerator program in order to start a new company with a different model working through abqid a bootcamp and accelerator program for entrepreneurs in new mexico szauter participated in “idea hack” sessions to develop a workable innovationthrough abqid szauter’s equiseq which develops genetic horse tests for breeders won first place at the  new mexico pitch fiesta an annual competition in which aspiring entrepreneurs present their business ideas in twominute “elevator pitches” a panel of four serial entrepreneurs judged the presentations awarding a firstplace cash prize of  to equiseq a graduate of the abqid startup accelerator program“investor interest started to heat up in the other company that was housing equiseq activity and we had to spin it off but they said i couldn’t be ceo of two companies” szauter said “so that’s when lexi walked in and became the ceo”palmer had just graduated from college and was desperate to do any job that was not a typical  to “i loved horses and did a lot of riding so i knew a lot of people in the industry” she said “paul asked me if i knew anything about science i said ‘i know absolutely nothing about science but i’ll learn’”and she did several times a week palmer and szauter sat down together to unravel the science behind genomics szauter had the lingo and technical information and palmer translated that sophisticated knowledge into easytounderstand language for consumers“we picked a problem that we thought would be a good place to start which was a genetic muscle disorder that was common in quarter horses and the age of onset is after the usual breeding age of most horses” szauter said“there is no way to eliminate it from quarter horses without a genetic test”no one had discovered which genes cause the disorder but szauter and his team found they could sequence horse genomes to pinpoint which gene mutation caused the disorder while researching the disease the equiseq team stumbled across a facebook group for owners of horses with the diseasemembers of the group began sharing information and dna samples with the company and equiseq had dna samples from  horses from which to launch their research“we found the gene pretty fast in about three weeks” szauter said “the data we collect is sick it makes astronomical look like a puny word in the first five months we collected  terrabytes of data comparing what we have to the public horse database they have  million variants and we have  million variants”the company was able to develop a test that identifies horses at risk for developing pssm before they show any symptoms“this will help change the equine industry our goal is to make our own test obsolete by having horses born without these diseases” said palmer “our clients are breeders and breed organizations because that starts the domino effect”identifying horses with the genetic mutation for pssm means those horses could be removed from the breeding pool thus removing that genetic variant from future horses the company is now working on a second test for a similar disorder that affects thoroughbredsfuture plans include developing a test for a neuromuscular disease called shivers and being able to offer full gene sequencing for horses“we have had some push back because there are those who will suffer financial harm” palmer said “if  percent of your stock has the gene variant then you lose money by not breeding that  percent but in the long run it’s not about me or paul or the company it’s about the horse community it’s about breeding out these diseases”this article was first featured on siliconcom and was written by heide brandessilicon covers technology news and the entrepreneurial communities in the “silicon” region

genetic information on your horse the knowledge is irrevocable you should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you whether now or as genetic research advances will be welcome or positive you should also understand that as research advances in order for you to assess the meaning of your horses dna in the context of such advances you may need to obtain further services from equiseq your veterinarian an equine researcher or other health care provider we encourage you to talk to your veterinarian prior to collecting your horses sample for testing to learn more so you can make an informed decision about whether testing is right for you your veterinarian also can help you understand your results and options you may learn information about your horse that you do not anticipate this information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your life and worldview you may discover things about your horse that trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change eg surprising facts related to your horses ancestry or that horses with your horses genotype have a higher than average chance of developing a specific condition or disease these outcomes could have social legal or economic implications the laboratory may not be able to process your sample and the laboratory process may result in errors the laboratory may not be able to process your sample if your hair blood or tissue sample does not contain a sufficient volume of dna you do not provide enough hair blood or tissue or the results from processing do not meet our standards for accuracy if the initial processing fails for any of these reasons equiseq will reprocess the same sample at no charge to the user if the second attempt to process the same sample fails equiseq will offer to collect a second sample at no charge if the user declines this option the user is entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to equiseq less shipping and handling provided that the user shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service if the user opts to submit another sample and equiseqs attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful equiseq will not request additional samples and the user will be entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to equiseq less shipping and handling provided the user shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the service if the user breaches this policy agreement and resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the service and processing is not successful equiseq will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide the user a refund even for processing that meets our high standards a small unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be uninterpretable or incorrect referred to as errors as this possibility is known in advance users are not entitled to refunds where these errors occur you should not change diet exercise medication or other health behaviors for your horse solely on the basis of information from equiseq make sure to discuss your horses genetic information with a veterinarian or other health care provider before you act upon the genetic information resulting from equiseq services for some diseases the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk there may be unknown genes or environmental factors that are far more important predictors if your data indicate that your horse is not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition you should not feel that your horse is protected the opposite is also true if your data indicate your horse is at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition it does not mean that your horse will definitively develop the disease or condition in either case if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through equiseq you should contact your veterinarian or other health care provider genetic research is not comprehensive while we may measure many millions of data points from your dna sample only a small percentage of them are known to be related to equine traits or health conditions the research community is rapidly learning more about genetics and an important mission of equiseq is to conduct and contribute to this research in addition some breeds are not well represented in genetic studies because interpretations provided in our service rely on these published studies some interpretations may not apply to your horse future scientific research may change the interpretation of your horses dna in the future the scientific community may show previous research to be incomplete or inaccurate genetic information that you share with others could be used against your interests you should consider carefully before sharing your horses genetic information with others you may want to consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your horses genetic information before you share it with anybody sharing your horses genetic information may also allow other people to infer genetic information about related horses that you do not own which might have an adverse effect on the interests of the owners of these horses furthermore genetic information that you choose to share with your veterinarian or other health care provider may become part of your horses medical record and through that route be accessible to other health care providers andor insurance companies in the future genetic information that you share with family friends or other people in the horse industry may be used against your interests even if you share genetic information that has no or limited meaning today that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made if you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned genetic information about health conditions and you do not disclose this to them this may be considered to be fraud equiseq services are for research informational and educational use only we do not provide veterinary advice the genetic information provided by equiseq is for research informational and educational use only this means two things first many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically validated and the technology we use which is the same technology used by the research community to date has not been widely used for clinical testing second in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical application of genetic

abqid demo day demo day for abqid is still two weeks away but the ceos are just now putting the final touches on their sixminute pitches for the event enlarge paul szauter the ceo of equiseq hopes to sequence horse genomes to find the gene that… more dan mayfield  albuquerque business first for szauter the ceo of the startup equiseq it hasn’t been easy “maybe there’s a better way than a bar fight” he said “the pitch practice is handtohand combat they parse every word with you” the idea is to get a ceo to be able to talk about their startup in the most efficient comprehensive and emotional way possible he said each of the companies that will present at demo day has been honing their pitches with coaches from the accelerator program for weeks in the hopes that they’ll find some traction with investors that will be invited to hear them speak at the epicenter — for that second date but abqid isn’t just about the pitch the program takes the companies through the rigorous lean startup method where they test and test and test their products in front of potential customers for weeks until they land on a product idea that really gets traction often the idea is significantly different from the original company idea in szauter’s case he went into abqid with equiseq hoping to sequence horse genomes to help breeders find the best way to maximize a horse but he said as the company tested that market it wasn’t the best way to go “one of the things about the accelerator is going out and really talking to people nominally i have these research forms but what that does is it forces you to talk” szauter said he found out that nobody cares about the genetics of their horses – unless their horses could pass on a certain devastating muscle disease “the key thing is the science is easy” he said “the thing is learning how to talk to horse people” equiseq did pivot and instead of sequencing a horse’s genome it is planning to test horses for the possibilities of passing on a certain gene that pivot he said has led him to a devoted group of horse lovers who are dealing with the disease “the key thing with any company is solving a pain point” he said “commercially we are taking care of somebody’s pain” industries technology suggested reading featured jobs auburn ca senior economic development specialist placer county washington dc director member and board relations great plains
