of the year clark associates inc published on thursday  april  written by joseph m carbonara editorial director during the past seven years companies from all segments of the foodservice industry have slugged it out with one another trying to keep from losing market share during a sluggish economic period in contrast one company from a small town in central pennsylvania continues to grow at an accelerated rate in fact during the past four years clark associates inc has almost tripled its annual revenues clark associates recipe is nothing too mysterious invest heavily in people and infrastructure deliver value on the customers terms use technology to drive efficiency and lower costs and dont be afraid to learn from mistakes along the way the result is a multifaceted economic juggernaut that has the entire foodservice industry sitting up and taking notice well we at fes noticed too and we proudly present clark associates with the magazines timehonored dealer of the year award one company multiple businesses any discussions in foodservice circles about clark associates seem to focus on one aspect of the business when people think about us everyone thinks about the webstaurantstore because it is our most visible channel of distribution but people dont realize how robust other aspects of our business are these are all large businesses in their own right says gene clark president clark food service equipment in a lot of cases what we sell are commodity items its the solution that we come up with to get you those items that is exciting indeed theres a lot more to clark associates than its ecommerce juggernaut we are a distribution company we are a stocking company says rachael weaver director of procurement for clark associates in general clark associates is a family of businesses tied to the foodservice industry the company has three main distribution channels the webstaurantstore ecommerce clark food service equipment and clark pro the more traditional dealership model and the restaurant store cash and carry we have these business models because we feel thats how our customers want to do business gene clark says working within these channels we can be anything to anyone the relationship clark food service equipment has with its customers ranges from a negotiated one that takes the form of an account manager regularly calling on an operator customer to determine their smallwares needs to a turnkey architectural relationship that helps a customer design and build a new foodservice operation still technology plays an important role in its success “we use the best of technology to get the best of the relationship now and in the future” says gene clark president of clark food service equipment middleand each of these distribution channels continues to thrive we have grown because we have customers that value our services and we have been able to zero in on them gene clark says people talk about adding value to their customers but maybe what you are providing is not adding value in the customers eyes having three distinctly different channels allows us to deliver different versions of value so that customers can decide the type of purchasing experience they want  understanding the nuances of each business and how to manage them internally also helps pave the way for organizational success each one of the three main distribution channels has a different set of cost structures and has different needs says fred clark clark associates ceo one may need a lot of inventory one may need a lot of capital for receivables and such one may need a lot of capital for technology they are all profitable because we look at each one differently from a pl standpoint another key piece of the corporate puzzle is  formed in   is the part of clark associates that handles bid work namely public money jobs such as school hospital and military foodservice projects we branded this part of the business differently to say this is a different situation and to differentiate the market segment says jim stephens president of  prior to joining clark associates jim stephens left president of the dealer’s  business unit worked as an electrical contractor this part of clark associates’ business has only  employees but focuses on bid work namely public money jobs such as school hospital and military foodservice projects the company handles such aspects of the job as scheduling utilities understanding how to work within construction practices and moreprior to joining clark associates stephens worked as an electrical contractor so he came to the role with firsthand knowledge of how challenging this type of business can be we think of ourselves as a construction company not a dealer so we think differently he says we dont play games and are not afraid to say this is our price officially  has  employees spanning offices in sarasota fla charlotte nc and lancaster pa but this division draws support from clarks formidable array of central services more on them later to remain lean and by focusing only on those projects that fall into its scope of services  continues to thrive we get the advantages of a big company but can remain small and nimble stephens says more people fail by going outside what makes them good in the name of growth in addition like a construction business  carries no real inventory and is mostly a cash businessstephens measures the success of  by looking at the number of jobs the division wins and its receivables most construction company failures have nothing to do with profitability its how you manage the cash stephens says you cant get bigger than the market will allow you to grow clark associates  business unit follows the cycles of the construction business and like the construction industry the  business can be very aggressive and price sensitive to get the job you have to be the low guy stephens says but i want people to come to us because they know we can handle the construction side of the business this includes handling such aspects of the job as scheduling utilities understanding how to work within construction practices and more we view our customers as being the general managers contractors or in a larger sense the school district stephens says central business services purchasing led by rachael weaver represents one of clark associates’ key central business functions this part of the company procures products for all three of the company’s main distribution channelsserving as pillars of support for those individual business units is a cadre of central business services when you look at the common denominator between those three distribution channels they require basic support services that dont change much from one to another this includes accounting payroll and so forth fred clark says consolidating those services keeps the costs down for the individual units as a result we can afford to hire some of the best people in their fields because we can spread those costs across those different channels when you take accounting or even employee benefits off the plates of our unit presidents or managers they have so much more time to focus on their channels one key centralized business service is purchasing which rachael weaver leads weaver came to clark eight years ago right out of college at nearby millersville university where she studied supply chain management weaver went through seven interviews at clark associates including two with fred clark before finally getting the job i had a passion for products and wanted to be in purchasing but i had no idea what i was getting into she recalls with a laugh weaver started as the countertop equipment buyer fred took me under his wing she says he met with me every tuesday for two years i would come with whatever i could to impress him her approach worked weaver quickly branched out into other areas and within three years was heading the department when weaver started with the company there were seven people in the purchasing department including fred clark while she and fred clark remain in purchasing today that department has plus people with another  to  college students set to join the company after graduation this spring fred loves purchasing and will always be involved in purchasing and hes pretty savvy when it comes to that she says to help accommodate the companys growth clark associates is constructing a new squarefoot facility on the site of its lancaster headquarters this will bring the purchasing department to one campus — right now it is spread out over three different locations we operate as one company and we operate as one unit our company has three main channels of distribution and as buyers we are responsible for buying pricing and picking the items that are sold in each of those channels weaver says so we have to understand each channels service level and the personality of the customer buying whether it be from the website in the stores or through the traditional distribution model sales growth gross profit dollars and inventory investment represent three key metrics weaver uses to measure the progress of her part of the business the pricing is different within each channel but not too far off from each other because all channels need to remain competitive weaver says pricing is transparent these days thanks to the internet we are able to see competitor flyers web pricing and even shelf prices online another strong example of how centralized business services can help the company thrive is the it department led by charlie garber chief information officer nine years ago while studying computer science at millersville university garber saw an ad that said clark associates was looking for someone to work in the areas of developer and it help desk i already had four parttime jobs at that point and thought why not give this a try i liked it so much that i quit my other jobs and started here full time garber says foodservice was never on my radar i never worked in a restaurant for me it was all programming i thought i could make anything work online and it turns out we can sell restaurant supplies that way for david groff left president of the webstaurantstore and charlie garber chief information officer joining the clark associates team was appealing because they saw an opportunity to have an impact on the company and grow their careerswhen garber started with clark the it team had all of three members and the company employed one web designer who worked in print today clark associates has a separate team that handles print projects and the it department has grown to more than  people and counting it is amazing how hard it is to get top talent for systems designers programmers they are in demand garber says so the future here is training more managers and getting more top talent for most dealerships the it department focuses on making sure the companys email system works properly and that the accounting systems and maybe even the website stay up and running for garber and the it team at clark associates thats just the beginning this group works with the other divisions to provide some of the technological support necessary to facilitate better customer experiences and communication among team members — all of which lead to growth and make the company more efficient what the individual businesses want to accomplish in the technology arena they work with me on garber says we have a huge team that can be moved from one division to another we dont just have webstaurantstore programmers we have programmers some will work on the webstaurantstore system some will work on our internal systems clark pro etc and like all of the other divisions within clark associates the it department embraces that spirit of continuous evolution and improvement we have a lot of things coming up that will be pretty impressive garber says we give all of our programmers experimental time like google does and its really branched out into some areas that we did not expect so it is going to be interesting to see how our customers respond across all of our channels we have so many users that we get so much feedback in a couple days that we know pretty quickly if something is going to work technology forward the companys technologyforward stance ties to its relentless pursuit of efficiency we are trying to automate and remove man hours gene clark says doing so removes cost from the system and allows us to provide real value we are an innovative force because we are always looking at things differently in fact the companys willingness to embrace technology provides a competitive edge in a tight price sensitive market i have always been about driving efficiencies and technology helps with that fred clark says efficiencies lower costs and the more you lower costs the more competitive you are in the marketplace the company is not afraid to develop its own custom solutions to meet the unique needs of such a diverse enterprise you can build something that could replace five or six employees and those sort of efficiencies give us an advantage garber says ever since i started here fred has been technology efficiency focused the approach has always been what systems can we build to be more efficient he has never been about throwing more bodies at it fred wants us to work more intelligently he has seen what technology can do for the company across each of clark associates three main distribution channels relationships and technology play a key role in the companys success and clark food service equipment perhaps the companys most traditional distribution channel is no exception we use the best of technology to get the best of the relationship now and in the future gene clark says in the case of clark food service equipment its a negotiated relationship that may take the form of an account manager regularly calling on an operator customer to determine their smallwares needs to a turnkey architectural relationship that helps a customer design and build a new foodservice operation such as a retirement community the typical clark food service equipment customer tends to be a larger more sophisticated operator that requires a specific level of service that is something more than the restaurant store can provide for example the clark food service equipment team visited a site managed by a contract feeder and took several pictures while touring the facility upon returning to the office the team developed a report specific to that facility that included recommendations on how to enhance the appearance customer experience and overall efficiency the relationship may start out as project based as is the case with  but can evolve into something more longterm as such clark food service equipment typically has about  to  active jobs at any given time mostly up and down the east coast gene clark says to help keep track of the current projects and those in the pipeline clark associates uses a proprietary system developed in house by the it team this system provides quick snapshots of projects and allows managers to dig deep into the details and clark food service equipment can handle its customers ongoing smallwares orders via its online arm — clark pro the clark food service equipment team similar to other parts of the company also uses lots of web conferencing to coordinate projects internally with clients and with other members of the project team in addition the company makes a lot of information available on its website including inventory levels product specs and videos that show how to use specific products people dont realize how much technology impacts other parts of our business gene clark says we have been able to grow because of technology and our people and technology allows us to leverage the talents ofour people technology continues to play a significant role in shaping a customers experience at the restaurant stores the dealers cashandcarry business which includes seven different locations in three states just because it is a cashandcarry model does not mean the restaurant store does not rely on relationships to drive its business forward steve leaman left vice president of the restaurant store says customers look to leverage the insights of longtime employees such as walt montgomerywhen most people think of a cashandcarry business the first thoughts that come to mind is a retail format dominated by lots of hobbyists looking for the latest cutting board or some other kitchen gadget while the restaurant store welcomes those folks its target customer tends to be independent restaurant operators churches or firehouses who need to place weekly resupply orders to help make this process more efficient for everyone involved regular customers can create quick pick lists on the restaurant stores website they can then visit the website order what they need and receive an email letting them know when its time to pick up their goods when they arrive at the store a staff member greets the customer asks if they need anything else and then loads the order into their car in other words it may be considered cash and carry but the restaurant store is a relationship business just like all the other aspects of clark associates we dont want to sell anyone anything they dont need says steve leaman vice president for the restaurant store we want to make sure it does not feel like a big box retail environment and we want them to come back to us as long as they are in business on average each restaurant store location employs about  people according to leaman this includes a branch manager a sales person merchandiser and others each location possesses two distinct characteristics first the staff has the ability to service the customer which includes being attentive on the sales floor via email and on the phone the second is maintaining a wellorganized and merchandised store so the customers have a shoppable experience in addition each restaurant store associate is well versed in how to qualify customers to make sure their needs align with the services this part of the business can provide if a customer is better served by another part of the business an associate will make an effort to connect them with a different clark associates division that is something that is instilled in all of us understanding who is a restaurant store customer and who is a clark food service equipment customer leaman adds it is all about the level of service you provide overall this approach continues to work for the restaurant store which posted a  percent increase in sales last year according to leaman few entities within the foodservice equipment and supplies community generate as much attention as thewebstaurantstore and thats due mostly to the ecommerce platforms stunning growth when i first started it was just one other person and i handling the calls chats and emails recalls dave groff president of the webstaurantstore today the webstaurantstore has a team of more than  associates to handle the influx of calls and emails and other duties that come with running an industryleading ecommerce site and the webstaurantstores investment in its people continues to facilitate its growth we have really focused on making sure we have topnotch people interacting with our customers groff says clark associates’ test kitchen serves as a training venue for associates and the dealership uses it to build community for example once a month the company hosts a birthday lunch associates who share the same birthday month come to the test kitchen and work together to prepare lunch for everyone else in the buildingto arm those topnotch individuals with the information they require to help customers make informed purchasing decisions webstaurantstore associates go through regular product training in the companys test kitchen — just as sales reps for any other dealership might we didnt want to be perceived as a minimum wage call center we want people to know they are working with true industry professionals groff says much like their operator customers speed of service remains a critical component to the success of the webstaurantstore one thing we are obsessed with is instant gratification groff says so we keep trying to get our customers their orders faster and faster i think the webstaurantstore keeps getting better and better every year to help get products into customers hands quicker clark associates continues to add distribution centers throughout the country today it operates eight distribution centers with another planned to open later this year in addition the company recently added an overnight shift in its nevada distribution center to keep orders flowing overall the company has more than  million square feet of warehouse space like other aspects of the business the webstaurantstore embraces a constant improvement philosophy by monitoring a series of performancebased metrics including wait time on the phone email response times page load times from the website errors and more even at the warehouse associates who pack orders see a monitor that lets them know what is in their queue the number of sameday shipments and more but the webstaurantstore does not limit the content necessary to create a good customer experience to the back end rather clark associates invests heavily in developing foodservice equipment and suppliesrelated content that customers can access while visiting the webstaurantstores site clark associates has an entire group of people dedicated to shooting photos and videos of the products it inventories and writing text that describes the features benefits and technical specifications of each item we want to be a resource and to educate the customer about how to buy the product that is the best fit for them groff says part of that is having the information or the content that helps customers really understand what they are buying whats most ironic about all of the investments clark associates makes in the webstaurantstore and all of its distribution channels for that matter is the fact that to the layman running a successful ecommerce business appears to be a lowcost endeavor i could not imagine something being farther from the truth groff says it takes a lot of overhead to make a website successful clark associates continues to use technology to improve the flow of information between trading partners to better answer such issues as why an item is on backorder why is it taking so long to ship an order and so forth those are the things we are trying to improve and we are taking it one vendor at a time garber adds and progress has been slow but steady from a stock ordering prospective in the last three years the big name vendors have really improved but some of the smaller vendors are still lagging in the area of electronic data interchange ordering weaver says we try to sell them on the savings of getting it done and a lot of vendors are still old school in terms of communication sometimes it takes weeks to get information that should take days people by and large clark associates is not a newcomer to the dealer community the company got its start in  and was a steadily growing regional player for years so what woke up this sleeping giant one of the transformative things has been getting the proper management team that absorbs freds energy and uses it to get our teams going in the right direction gene clark says indeed while the various technological solutions clark associates uses are impressive they are only as effective as the employees using them it all has to do with our people we have made some of the best hires over the past five years and that has been the catalyst of our real growth fred clark says these people are ambitious they are aggressive they want to do well and they want to grow overall the company looks for two key traits when hiring new associates work ethic and intelligence according to fred clark if theres anything that bleeds through everyone in this company it is work ethic weaver adds the typical clark associate exhibits other key attributes first they have a strong entrepreneurial spirit in other words the company attracts people that have ideas will take risks and speak up we have ideas coming from everywhere garber says and finally they will do the right thing we want people who are honest and ethical groff adds because the company continues to grow so fast across a variety of channels finding other models to emulate is not an option and that impacts the type of person clark associates will hire i want someone thats determined to be the best garber adds i want someone that will produce the best solution no matter what the more passionate they are the better one thing clark associates is not hung up on when it comes to recruiting new people is experience in the foodservice industry the company looks for experts in their respective disciplines and then teaches them the nuances of the foodservice industry the people we want are obsessive about their niche whether it is online development system engineers or anything along that scope we are looking for people that are passionate garber adds they dont care whether they are making an ecommerce site for muscle cars or foodservice its the same they are making a cool website and working in code to make neat cool features someone that buys from amazon or the webstaurantstore — they want a good online shopping experience while its people represent one of clark associates greatest assets attracting and retaining top talent doubles as a key challenge one advantage clark associates offers prospective employees is the opportunity to advance their careers quickly if you are good and work hard you have the opportunity to get fed additional responsibilities leaman points out its one thing to say that but in my time with the company we have had people move up with us and it provides credibility to when we say that to new people joining the company take groff for example roughly  years ago groff who was about to graduate from penn state university with a degree in logistics crossed paths with fred clark by chance naturally when fred clark invited him to learn more about the dealership groff became intrigued i knew a little about the business having known fred and his family before but really had no idea all this business entailed groff says after learning more about the burgeoning company and clarks plans groff saw a fasttrack opportunity for growth and development and seized it the internship i had in college was a great experience but i also realized how long it was going to take me to get where i wanted groff recalls i dont think i have ever had a day in this job that is boring while others in the foodservice industry bemoan the lack of young people in their business clark associates takes a more proactive approach to recruiting them working with young people is a challenge because they are so smart and use technology so much fred clark says so working with them means staying on top of it as much as i can clark associates looks for people via colleges and naturally the company uses joboriented web sites dave steve and myself — we have all worked job fairs gene clark says i am more than happy to work a job fair because it shows people we are serious about who we hire nobody grows up wanting to sell foodservice equipment why would you but when you think about it theres a lot of opportunity we are viewed as an edgy millennialfriendly company there is a fluidity to who we are adds leaman who is fast approaching his second anniversary leaman came to clark associates from the healthcare industry where he worked in an administrative role with his company going through some consolidation the time was right for leaman to make a change understanding how someones personality impacts their role really helps clark associates function as a dynamic and cohesive team it really comes down to a strategy about how to work with people the dominant person understands that the analytical person might need some reassurance from time to time weaver says our associates have to work smart and know how to work together it is important that we are comfortable with each other because we will work better together given the unique nature of the construction world the  crew features more taskoriented types we are not a bunch of salesmen stephens says when reps meet us and try to treat us like salesmen by chatting us up they find we dont respond well and they get shut down but to have a successful company you need all personality types in addition the companys it department has developed a proprietary hiring system that allows managers to view all the open positions within the company lets say someone submits an application for a purchasing position but they might be better suited to work in one of the stores i can send that application over to steve for consideration weaver adds we are all team players and it is important to understand what the other does touring the building that houses the webstaurantstore it department and other business services is unlike visiting any other dealership in the us theres a gym where associates and their spouses can exercise ping pong and billiards tables a popcorn machine a soda fountain and more even the decorations are unique with everything from graphics that mimic video games or other famous drawings to an sera american flag to bamboo plants in addition to serving as a training venue the test kitchen also helps build community within clark associates for example once a month the company hosts a birthday lunch associates who share the same birthday month come to the test kitchen and work together to prepare lunch for everyone else in the building not only does it help build community these associates get to interact with others from various departments and learn more about the foodservice equipment and supplies the company sells having these resources really helps when we talk to a potential new hire and eventually bring someone on board we expect a lot from our people but they should also feel the company acknowledges what they have accomplished groff says as we get bigger its harder to know everyone having the ping pong table is a way to get to know each other and build community dont however confuse this environment with being soft on performance the tech and marketing worlds are performance based we know if we are getting something done and have performance metrics for every single department you see them when you walk through the building garber says we know how many photos each employee took and how many descriptions each writer wrote we know every ticket a programmer handled they have thresholds they have to hit we put a lot of trust into our employees in every one of ourdivisions you can goof off and that will show or you can work incredibly hard and get a lot done and that will show it is an adult work environment we dont micromanage and when you make people feel good and trusted they will do better weaver adds managing growth over the past eight years clark associates opened six warehouses and one cashandcarry store while remodeling two other retail locations in other words theres no time for complacency fred has always had very high expectations hes a very fair person but you cant say freds complacent garber says we do it better every time because of our growth the way we did things yesterday is not the way we will do it tomorrow weaver says thats our biggest challenge because we have a lot of new people trying to learn our business model and we have to react to our growth at the same time indeed data plays a key role when clark associates evaluates new opportunities and tries to measure the performance of the business in general the company will test some of the ideas out and then let the data determine its fate it becomes cut and dry as to whether it works garber adds we are a very datadriven company and with the data we have available to us why wouldnt you be you would be wasting a lot of opportunity if you did not maximize the data available to you of course in the fastpaced world of ecommerce managing customer expectations specifically when things dont go according to plan can make or break an organization and clark associates is no exception garber sees all of the complaints that come in about the sites for the webstaurantstore and the restaurant store siterelated complaints are sent to a developer or a designer to fix the issue and work with a customer service agent to reach out to any clients the issue may have affected i love complaints more than compliments because you can learn more from them garber adds we will roll out something similar to amazon where customers can review how we did with their shipment and we will be able to track the review of a package all the way down to the employee that packed it this will enable the clark team to know how the customer feels about every aspect of their purchase and provide the employee with metrics by which to measure their performance one of the hardest things to do when making a website is to look at it from a customers perspective and thats what we do here garber says we look at some sites and wonder if anyone has ever gone through it i shop online and some of things sites will do are mind boggling and i shop on our site as do some of our people and when you have highly entrepreneurial motivated people looking at your site they see things that can be improved another aspect that keeps clark associates nimble is its lack of corporate bureaucracy this helps the company maintain its customer focus and facilitates speed to market when i make a decision to open a new store our team makes a plan submits it to accounting and that gets the ball rolling leaman points out we are forever changing and adapting to the climate of the business world its not like turning an aircraft carrier and fred clark gives his managers room to roam it is important to empower your managers and fred trusts his managers you have to be able to trust your managers and that they are able to take it to the next level weaver says being open to change is part of the company dna at clark associates and it starts at the top freds philosophy is i would rather be pulling you back than pushing you forward garber says if i get too cautious you can tell hes not too happy but by all accounts it would seem that theres lots to be happy about related articles

specification customer reviews and comparison price i want recommend that you check the purchase price  ive been a smoker of smokes for sixtytwo years my spouse and i stop smoking cigarettes by using the green machine electronic digital cigarette i was very skeptical when i bought it because i more than likely accept anyone telling myself that i could leave cigarettesthe green equipment is an electronic cigarette that uses injections of a formula that makes you believe that youre smoking the vapors that you inhale are flavored heavy steam a smoker enjoys the smoke from a cigarette and without the similarity of smoke there is no satisfaction the heavy steam is there when you exhale and provides substantive satisfactionwhat about the kick you askyou can purchase several tastes for the green equipment tobacco blueberry mint menthol and many more flavours are available and can be obtained with pure nicotine in the formula or without it i began with the tobacco taste with nicotine because i actually was skeptical of the smokers satisfaction i are now smoking the blueberry flavor with nicotine and i am very pleased with the smokers kick apparently the only thing absent is the tars but thats not detectableexactly what is the difference between smokes and the green equipmentcigarette smokers inhale tars from the tobacco that cause blockages in the blood stream i leave smoking tobacco because my spouse and i had a heart assault the key artery in my heart became blocked and could not pump the blood for recirculation i had fashioned to have surgery to unblock the artery and i spent five days and nights in intensive care so they could get my heart to again defeat in a rhythmic mouvementthe green machine will not produce tars and when consulting my cardiologist i received approval for use the pleasure perhaps there is and the danger is minimal in comparison to cigarettesi never thought id be able to quit cigarettes until my spouse and i tried the green equipment there are several other electronic cigarettes on industry but the green equipment is the one i actually use and functions  months ago i would have given anyone a stiff argument about the dangers of tobacco use i had all the answers to all the antismokers arguments now we know i used to be dead incorrect no im not lifeless but i could have been because i was too stubborn to pay

to уou what current owners necessity certainly to express over it with regards to quitting smoking everyone panics and cant decide which smoking alternativecessation to choose due to side effects the safest option and most healthy options are the digital cigarette are there any side effects to the ecigarettemost people would say no side results what so ever nevertheless  i have to somewhat disagree any time you are trying a new product  of the time there is always some kind of concern heres what i actually uncovered after using the electronic cigarette for  weeks straight now free of moisture mouthfrom day one of using the electric cigarette i indeed experienced dry mouth i never had dry mouth before because i usually drink everywhere from  ounces of water a day consistently after i took the first  puffs my spouse and i noticed my mouth sense like cottonfrom that point on i upped my water to see if the dryness was actually coming from the ecigarette i puffed again a few times and the cotton mouth delivered however the dry jaws was not going to scare me away because i am smoke totally free for  weeks and this side effect is nothing slight headachethe initial few days of using the ecigarette my spouse and i had a slight frustration i recently came across my head harm more once i inhaled too much at any given time the materials in the ecigarette are propylene glycol glycerin filtered water nicotine terpineol methylfurfural and vanilla extractnevertheless after the two week mark i noticed the headache was gone might be every other day possibly even i would get an extremely slight one but nothing to really grumble about loss of cravingsthis side effect could be perfect for many they will say when you leave smoking you can gain weight i really believe if your a food person really all in your brain and you will go right to food however with the ecigarette i observed i really havent recently been hungry at all the more i puff on it the more my spouse and i lost my appetite this may definitely vary everyone is different and definitely will react differentalthough i experienced some effects i am still smoke free this was totally worth it merely be sure
