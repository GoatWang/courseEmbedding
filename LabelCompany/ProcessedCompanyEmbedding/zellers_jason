stores were retained the president and ceo of zellers mark foote had a mandate to liquidate the  zellers stores in preparing it for targets takeover by october  footes strategy was to use a blueprint of a retail liquidation but without the typical insolvency and desperation that plagued failing chains foote focused on raising profits even if that meant losing market share and reducing store traffic by ramping up inventory levels of highermargin goods over loss leaders such as apparel over deeply discounted paper towels and detergent and slashing costs foote also replaced the expensive fall television ad campaign with a social media blitz on facebook reportedly the strategy was paying off as zellers’ operating profit was “well ahead of expectations” and the retailer had “performed very well” in  in march  the first  zellers stores were put in liquidation this included all  zellers stores slated to become walmart outlets by midjune the latter locations were closed to the public

stores were to happen at the latest on march   which coincided with the deadline date the hbc had to vacate the sites acquired by target the hbcs main reason for closing the  remaining stores was due to zellers lack of profitability the hbc also remarked that it would not be viable to keep zellers as an ongoing chain due to the geographical locations of the remaining  stores the hbc did not exclude the possibility of keeping some stores open and converting them as the bay or home outfitters outlets after the deal with target corporation hbc still a burden in halfambiguous of the million

advertising campaign and then rose to his popularity by the early s the main purpose of zeddy was to advertise toyland the toy section in zellers stores zellers would provide a stuffed zeddy bear for any child who had a birthday party sponsored by zellers there would also be a zellers employee in a giant zeddy costume hosting the party lineup toys of zeddy were also created in the final months

stickers zeddy remains used as a baby brand for products such as diapers and baby bath products during the festive finale campaign in  zeddy was reintroduced in weekly flyers for zellers toyland

to other retailers or returned to the landlords who own the sites riocan reit was significantly affected as many of its mall properties include zellers locations in addition the united food and commercial workers union planned to hold demonstrations as many zellers staffers were to be laid off instead of being retained by target or walmart this was in marked contrast to the takeover of woolco by walmart in  where all woolco employees of the acquired stores were retained the president and ceo of zellers mark foote had a mandate to liquidate the  zellers stores in preparing it for targets takeover by october  footes strategy was to use a blueprint of a retail liquidation but without the typical insolvency and desperation that plagued failing chains foote focused on raising profits even if that meant losing market share and reducing store traffic by ramping up inventory levels of highermargin goods over loss leaders such as apparel over deeply discounted paper towels and detergent and slashing costs foote also replaced the expensive fall television ad campaign with a social media blitz on facebook reportedly the strategy was paying off as zellers’ operating profit was “well ahead of expectations” and the retailer had “performed very well” in  in march  the first  zellers stores were put in liquidation this included all  zellers stores slated to become walmart

the hbcs main reason for closing the  remaining stores was due to zellers lack of profitability the hbc also remarked that it would not be viable to keep zellers as an ongoing chain due to the geographical locations of the remaining  stores the hbc did not exclude the possibility of keeping some stores open and converting them as the bay or home outfitters outlets after the deal with target
