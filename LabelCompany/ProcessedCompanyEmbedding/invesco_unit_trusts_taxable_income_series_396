the american recovery  reinvestment act of 9 it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments impairing the issuers ability to make scheduled interest payments the trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer this makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio the trust is more susceptible to political
