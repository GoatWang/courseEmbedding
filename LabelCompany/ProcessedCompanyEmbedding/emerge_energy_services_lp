an outstanding job he knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim we are so happy we did not go

mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially after investigating and speaking with several attorneys i was most impressed with lars i have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and i found lars to be extremely intelligent compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation lars was on top of every detail of the process due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment i cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation he truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case if i ever had to file suit again i would not hesitate to contact lars again in a second i cannot recommend him enough he does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time i was most impressed with his attitude responsiveness knowledge and compassion i cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of needjohn c • clientthank god for this guy lars soreide is amazing he recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who
