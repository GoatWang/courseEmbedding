syndrome is an acute immunemediated polyneuropathy where the immune system is triggered into attacking the myelin sheath surrounding nerves leading to progressive fairly symmetric muscle weakness accompanied by absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes patients usually present a few days to a week after onset of symptoms the weakness can vary from mild difficulty with walking to nearly complete paralysis of all extremities facial respiratory and bulbar muscles guillainbarré syndrome occurs worldwide with an overall incidence of one to two per  per year and over  patients admitted to us hospitals with a primary diagnosis of gbs every year while all age groups are affected the incidence increases by approximately  percent with every tenyear increase in age beyond the first decade of life patients are treated with supportive care plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin ivig the proportion of patients with gbs who walk independently at six months and one year after diagnosis is approximately  and  percent respectively at one year full recovery of motor strength occurs in about  percent of patients while severe motor problems persist in about  percent approximately five to ten percent of patients with gbs have a prolonged course with several months of ventilator dependency and very delayed and incomplete recovery within one year of diagnosis approximately  to  percent of patients with gbs die despite intensive care coversin has been successfully tested in animal models of guillain barré syndrome gbs in gbs complementmediated damage is provoked by the deposition of autoantibodies against the neuromuscular junction in the myelin sheath this in turn triggers systemic complement activation and local tissue destruction with often devastating neurological

william blair news overview news and eventswilliam blair in the mediaawards  recognitionsfor the press akari therapeutics plc initiation of research coverage thursday april   william blair  company initiated research coverage of akari therapeutics plc aktx  akari therapeutics is a developmentstage biotechnology company focused on development of nextgeneration complement inhibitors for the treatment of rare hematologic diseases analyst tim lugo said “akari therapeutics’ lead candidate coversin is a nextgeneration complement inhibitor in earlystage clinical trials complement inhibition has become a blockbuster therapeutic category with the success of soliris which generated  billion in  revenue given the alternative binding site of coversin versus soliris the product should find a niche in nonsolirisresponding patients whose genetic mutations prevent the activity of soliris akari has already successfully treated one such european patient and presented this data at the  american society of hematology meeting we believe that coversin has several other potential competitive advantages to soliris including a oncedaily selfadministered subcutaneous injection ltbindependent inhibition and a smaller molecule which may allow increased tissue penetration” lugo added “the company’s phase ii study is likely to be detailed at akari’s analyst event on april  and should provide data on several additional patients to date the product has a clean side effect profile from the phase i data in normal healthy patients in addition preclinical data reinforces the limited clinical data and suggests that coversin is blocking complement with c inhibition being a validated method of treatment in the rare lifethreatening rare diseases of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome we see the upcoming phase ii data set as a major valuecreating event for the company” william blair is a global investment banking and asset management firm we are

designation for coversin march    et  source akari therapeutics plc new york and london march   globe newswire  akari therapeutics nasdaqaktx an emerging growth clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company announced today that the us food and drug administration fda has granted fast track designation for coversin™ for treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh in patients who have polymorphisms conferring eculizumab resistance coversin™ is a secondgeneration complement inhibitor that acts on complement componentc preventing the release of ca and the formation of cb– also known as the membrane attack complex or mac and independently also inhibits ltb activity “we are very proud of the continued advancement of our coversin program for the treatment of pnh in patients with or without polymorphisms” said dr gur roshwalb chief executive officer of akari therapeutics “the fda fast track designation recognizes the unmet need in patients with pnh who cannot be treated with the current standard of care due to polymorphisms” akari is evaluating coversin in two phase  clinical trials the first phase  trial is evaluating coversin™ in patients with pnh who have never received a complement blocking therapy interim results from this ongoing phase  trial will be presented at the recently announced research and development day to be held on april   in new york the second phase  trial is evaluating coversin in patients with pnh and c polymorphisms resistant to eculizumab one patient has been enrolled in this trial and has demonstrated significant ldh reduction and complete complement blockade with selfadministered subcutaneous coversin™ for over one year the fast track program was created by the fda to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs which show promise in treating a serious or lifethreatening disease and address an unmet medical need drugs that receive this designation benefit from more frequent communications and meetings with fda to review the drugs development plan including the design of the proposed clinical trials use of biomarkers and the extent of data needed for approval drugs with fast track designation may qualify for priority review to expedite the fda review process if relevant criteria are met about akari therapeutics plc akari is a clinicalstage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of lifetransforming treatments for a range of rare and orphan autoimmune and inflammatory diseases caused by dysregulation of complement c and leukotriene b ltb including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria “pnh” atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome “ahus” and guillain barré syndrome “gbs”  akari’s lead product candidate coversin™ complement inhibitor a secondgeneration complement inhibitor acts on complement componentc preventing the release of ca and the formation of cb– also known as the membrane attack complex or mac and independently also inhibits ltb activity  c inhibition is growing in importance in a range of rare autoimmune diseases related to dysregulation of the complement component of the immune system including pnh ahus and gbs exploiting the power of nature akari is also developing other tick derived proteins and expects to bring additional compounds to clinical trials over the next several years the pipeline is focused on developing bioengineered versions of native tick salivary proteins that act as antiinflammatory compounds allowing the tick to remain on its host these compounds include pgp sparing ltb inhibitors classical and alternative complement inhibitors antihistamines and serotonin inhibitors as examples akari is also developing engineered forms that allow for potential oral absorption as for example a potential orally absorbed c inhibitor and tissue specific proteins as for example coversin™ that acts specifically at the neuromuscular junction for diseases like myasthenia gravis cautionary note regarding forwardlooking
