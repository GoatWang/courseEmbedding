purchase“the first thing the midwife noticed about michael k when she helped him out of his mother into the world was that he had a hare lip the lip curled like a snail’s foot the left nostril gaped obscuring the child for a moment from it’s mother she prodded open the tiny bud of a mouth and was thankful to find the palate whole”in this novel by nobel prize winner jm coetzee michael k is a simpleminded young man living in the middle of a civil war in south africa his mother a maid in the home of a white family is ailing the family she works for has left the city making no provisions to take care of their servants she not only asks michael to care for her but she requests that he take her back to her home in the countryone of the things that struck me most about this novel was the “science fiction” feeling of the book we have michael who is like a stranger in a strange land he cannot communicate because of his deformity and with the war going on he is in danger from both the army and the insurgents the countryside is devastated it is dry and hot there is no food anywhere and of course michael is black he does not have value hereyet through it all michael cherishes his freedom – which is taken away on several occasions he strives to maintain his dignity and eventually we see the light of compassion in othersso many times in novels relating to the horrors of war in africa it feels like the reader is outside looking in coetzee is for me at least able to extend the feeling of what it is like to be michael k i really enjoyed life  times of michael k and hope to

format paperbackverified purchaseoppression is a recurring theme in coetzee novels and it is the theme that drives life and times of michael k while the novel is set in south africa it is not explicitly perhaps not even impliedly a novel about racial oppression rather michael is treated as an outsider as subservient because he is disfigured and mentally dull having been raised in an institution where he was taught to peel potatoes before being given a job as a municipal gardener michael wants nothing more than to be left alone nose to the ground to work the fertile land of his ancestry he is a simple man with simple needs and the simplest of thosefreedomis bedeviled by travel permits and curfews and work camps by a civil war he does not understand by societal demands that do not concern him throughout the novel coetzee illustrates the oppression of war of institutions and bureaucracies of demanding parents of uncaring employers and landowners even the doctor who envisions himself as michaels savior wants to bend michael to his own willusing prose that is plain yet elegant coetzee creates empathy for michaels plightwe feel for him when his crops are trampled when he is removed from the land he loves when he is forced to do physical labor for the benefit of those who have political pull with the authorities when he is badgered to talk about his past when he is not permitted to indulge the simple pleasures of sleeping and eating as he chooses michael thinks of himself as an earthworm but he lacks an earthworms freedom to be true to itself the last few pages of the novel are almost an ode to simplicity to the freedom of living off the land unencumbered by the dictates of those who would imprison nonconformistslife and times of michael k is an important contribution to world literature it is also a moving beautifully written novel five starsread morecomment  people found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of

paperbackverified purchasemichael k is a puzzling combination of total passivity and active ingenious coping with his very difficult situation a sort of fantasy on the chaos of south african culture toward the end of the apartheid era the tale is an allegory of a seriously troubled society the main shortcoming of the book is the difficulty it presents to the reader in ferreting out just what it is allegorizing but the author is a master of language and the book would be worth reading on that head aloneread morecommentwas this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starspage
