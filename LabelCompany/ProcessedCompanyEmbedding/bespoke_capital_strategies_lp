capital partners merchant banking strategy following the completion of the 8 million investment into  hour fitness that we did in partnership with dean bradley osborne the joint managing partners rob berner and mark harms have agreed to establish a  venture for additional merchant banking transactions robs entity rlb partners and glcp the principal investment arm of glp has established bespoke capital partners llc bespoke bespoke capital partners name succinctly describes the business model bespoke the definition of bespoke is custom made bespoke tailors solutions to complex investment transactions requiring a thoughtful approach deep sector knowledge and a clear understanding of the companys and other shareholders needs  hour fitness  the  hour fitness transaction was bespoke in that we designed solutions to a variety of issues that the sellers had identified maximize certainty avoid an auction achieve a fair price manage a complex set of timing and management issues we brought in aea and ontario teachers pension plan together with a fully underwritten financing from jp morgan to maximize certainty of closing we met the sellers price objectives which enabled them to avoid a second auction process for the business we worked to the sellers timetable as they were selling another business and reached agreement with us then put our deal on hold while they finalized the other transaction then completed ours quickly and efficiently as we had as glp operating partners two outstanding sector executives who were prepared to step in to run the company if necessary we were able to mitigate a potentially onerous management transition issue in the end we closed the deal expeditiously including raising capital in two months inserted two glp operating partners as the new ceo and president of the company and developed a value enhancement strategy which is now in execution mode the  hour fitness transaction is the model for bespoke  nomacorc – the nomacorc transaction is also bespoke in that we designed a transaction structure to meet the needs of the companys founder marc noel whose firm noel group is bespokes partner in the investment and also meet the needs of the selling shareholder summit partners  marc noel was seeking a partner who could bring a long term perspective potentially as long as ten years a significant amount of industrial knowledge which we brought via ken lamb the glp operating partner who is one of the worlds leading experts on wine strategic and transactional value added which glp will do with its presence in europe as well as a significant amount of capital we raised c 7 million and invested  million into nomacorc  summit was seeking to maximize certainty avoid an auction achieve a fair price and complete the deal quickly  we worked to the sellers timetable completing the transaction in approximately three months start to finish raising the needed debt and equity capital completing due diligence and enhancing a carefully thought out platform development strategy  two glp operating partners ken lamb and bill rogers were instrumental in completing the transaction and acted as consultants to the consortium  they will join the board of nomacorc as well as having board roles in the general partner of the fund we established to make the investment   capital bespoke will be in the capital raising business as principal we plan to raise capital as sponsor or cosponsor as we have total flexibility as to size and structure we can tailor the amount and type of capital that we provide to a given situation we can make debt mezzanine and equity investments with size ranging from very small  m to very large  million partners rob berner lindsay harms and mark harms are all partners in this venture along with the other investors in and shareholders of glp bespoke will in every situation partner with management and likely also with glp operating partners for larger transactions we will also partner with sector leading private equity firms with which we have close and long standing relationships we will identify the right capital for each opportunity and then bring together our capital and the transaction in a highly thoughtful and structured way we will be partnering with the capital that we raise and acting as a steward for and manager of this capital the team the managing partners are robert berner iii and mark harms the investment committee is constituted of rob berner and lindsay and mark harms the managing partners will be supported by the glp team in london in particular by michael petschler robert berner iii joint managing partner of bcp is a highly experienced investor rob was a senior morgan stanley banker running the consumer group prior to moving to private equity he first worked at charterhouse then joined ripplewood ultimately becoming the  partner there then joined cvc to cohead their north american business rob has completed over  buyouts in his private equity career investing over  billion rob left cvc to set up rlb capital a holding company for his private investments  rob is currently chairman of three businesses dds a circa m retail distribution  services businesses owned by him and his brother in law johnnieo a fast growing branded apparel company and lottery rewards a business founded by the former ceo of the ny state lottery rob is based in the new york area the strategy bespoke capital partners objective is to invest in  portfolio companies over the next five years across the leisure and consumer space in both the us and europe creating a diversified portfolio of businesses our goal is to reach  b in aum investing between  m on the small end to  m on the high end per deal we will augment our already powerful existing group of  glp operating partners with additional sector experts who can help us seek to manage supervise and add value to the investments in the portfolio our objective is to be disciplined regarding our investments we plan to take either significant minority stakes with strong governance rights and carefully thought through exit provisions or controlling stakes in the businesses we back we will not do passive co investment we will seek transformational opportunities either by investing in growth industry consolidation or turnaround situations opportunities that will be of interest to us will combine an attractive valuation strong growthturnaround prospects and potential for operational improvement leveraging our operating capabilities we do not plan to participate in auctions we will seek a combination of transaction fees to help pay the overhead and management and incentive fees to compensate us for the value we expect to add we will expand our partnering activities with the private equity firms that we regard as market leaders and best in class leveraging their infrastructure and expertise for larger transactions as well as access to debt financing as many funds reduce the absolute size of their commitments they welcome value added partners such as us as an additional source of capital to augment their lp relationships we believe our business model is compelling to many of the more sophisticated family office and institutional investors as with our model they dont have to pay management fees on uninvested capital they also have a direct say over whether or not they make an investment and will have a more aligned management and incentive fee structure than is the norm with traditional private equity we have a strong group of existing lp investors desirous of more product from us and a group of potential lp investors who couldnt invest in either of  hour or nomacorc  primarily as a result of timing issues glp is a women and minority owned business by virtue of the fact that lindsay harms is a cofounder equal controlling shareholder of glp and board member of fcp we plan to build on this significant point of differentiation with both capital providers and target companies we are excited about the next phase of growth of glp with a strong partner a sound business plan and a lot of deal opportunities we believe that the creation of bespoke will help our advisory business as not every opportunity will be appropriate for bespoke our philosophy has always been to tailor solutions for our clients and invest where appropriate and welcomed and we will continue to take this approach  home   about us    activities  sector focus    transaction history    bespoke capital partners    team    operating partners    news    contact us copyright  global
