wholesale distribution business for electrical communications and data networking products and is a provider of related supplychain management and logistics services it is included on the fortune  list of the largest united states corporations founded in  in cleveland ohio by elisha gray and enos barton it was the origin of the western electric company on december   it was separately incorporated as graybar electric company inc contents  history  early history  incorporation as western electric  formation of graybar  recent years  see also  notes  references  external links historyedit early historyedit during the postcivil war reconstruction era an entrepreneur named enos barton who had served as a telegrapher during the war worked for western union in rochester new york during this period barton met george shawk the foreman of the companys cleveland ohio shop when that shop was closed down shawk bought some of the equipment and went into business for himself making various kinds of electrical and other apparatus including inventors models while on a trip to rochester he and barton who was then  agreed to go into partnership to raise the  her son needed for his share of the business venture bartons widowed mother mortgaged her home the new firm located at  st clair street in cleveland grew in may  elisha gray an oberlin college professor and inventor of telegraphic equipment bought out shawks interest up until then gray had been one of the firms top customers he had invented a needle annunciator for hotels and elevators a telautograph a machine for the electrical transmission of writing and the telegraph answerback call box gray and barton joined forces with an investment of  each with gray as the senior partner the success of the new company attracted the attention of general anson stager general superintendent of the western union telegraph company he offered to enter the business as an equal partner with gray and barton providing the companys headquarters was moved from cleveland to chicago illinois in december  the company moved to  s water street chicago the great great chicago fire in  came within two blocks of its small plant chicago illinois building which housed the shops and offices of gray  barton in the early s the destruction caused by the fire resulted in greater growth for gray  barton as the company sold fire alarms and helped rebuild the western union infrastructure in the city incorporation as western electricedit graybar electric internal call system preserved at edison and ford winter estates after several relocations all in chicago the business was incorporated as the western electric manufacturing company in  to meet the capital requirements of the telegraph supply business the new company so closely allied with the elder western that three of its five directors were western union executives moreover stager was named president although it was barton as secretarytreasurer who actually handled daytoday affairs although the young firm thrived in the telegraph industry it was not until the invention of the telephone by alexander graham bell in  and the incandescent lamp by thomas alva edison in  that western electric began to gain stature as a large company partowner gray held the title of company electrician and spent his days working on his inventions becoming increasingly less involved in the operations of the shop and eventually he sold his interest in western electric in  and retired to pursue independent research and to teach at oberlin college in  he filed a caveat with the us patent office announcing his intention to soon patent an invention that would transmit vocal sounds telegraphically gray dubbed his telephone the harmonic telegraph only hours earlier however alexander graham bell applied for a patent for the same idea which became known as the telephone as it turned out what bell actually patented would have never worked while grays idea would have western union acquired both grays and edisons telephone patents to challenge the american bell telephony company renamed att in  which led to a patent infringement suit and bell ultimately being named the inventor of the telephone therefore it was bells patent and not gray’s that launched the telecommunications industry further information elisha gray and alexander bell telephone controversy as applications of electricity broadened western electric not only sold the electric bells and batteries telegraph keys fire alarm boxes and hotel annunciators it originally manufactured but also many items it purchased from other manufacturers stager served as president of western electric until shortly before his death in  and barton then served as president from  to  western electric company was the first company to join in a japanese joint venture with foreign capital it invested in nippon electric company in  western electric held  of nec at the time their representative in japan was walter tenney carleton by the turn of the century western electric had become the main producer of telephone equipment in the united states it also manufactured arc lamps lighting equipment and power apparatus ranging from small fans to huge motors and generators alongside manufacturing the distribution business continued to grow handling an extensive line of electrical supplies such as wire conduit wiring devices and pole line material by the s the company became the world’s largest distributor and the united states’ leading wholesaler of electrical supplies these facts attracted investment by the american bell telephone company which also discovered that gray and barton could purchase supplies and sell them to the telephone companies more efficiently than the companies could acquire the supplies themselves a chain of warehouses was established across the nation and the growth of the distributing business continued to increase through world war i and into the postwar period formation of graybaredit graybar president albert l salt left presents  million check to western electric president edgar s bloom as graybar employees’ down payment toward the purchase of their company in  scores of electrical supply manufacturers were using the companys distribution network and business relationships were formed some of these relationships such as with general electric and the square d company are more than a century old and still exist today in  a separate entity was established for handling distribution of supplies and equipment this new entity was named graybar in honor of the companys founders elisha gray and enos barton this was the first time a major corporation had reverted to its original designation as the basis for its corporate name the graybar electric company was capitalized at  million and consisted of  distributing houses in cities across the united states graybar had become the largest merchandiser of electrical supplies in the world in  graybar employees purchased their company for its capitalized value which consisted of  million in cash and  million in cumulative preferred stock graybars corporate headquarters were located at the graybar building in new york city until  during the s the company explored many different avenues of income including a line of appliances and sewing machines under the graybar brand by  the companys sales volume was more than  million the number of distribution houses had jumped to  and there was a corresponding increase in personnel also that year the remaining outstanding shares of stock were purchased from western electric with a  million check signed by graybar president frank a ketcham when the country entered world war ii graybars ingenuity and knowledge of logistics proved to be of immeasurable value in providing warneeded goods graybar became a vital link between americas manufacturers and americas defense needs defenserelated business continued in the postwar era with graybar again aiding the military during the subsequent korean war and vietnam war overall the company enjoyed strong growth in the years following world war ii its momentum not checked until the recession of the mids which led to graybar slashing its workforce by  as a result when economic conditions improved in the s graybar was unable to gear up quickly enough to meet the rising demand for electrical products the corporate headquarters moved from the graybar building in new york city to clayton missouri in  recent yearsedit the current graybar corporate headquarters at the graybar building clayton missouri graybar modernized its infrastructure implementing one of the first computertocomputer ordering systems but a weak real estate market and slowdown in construction began to take its toll on the bottom line revenues which had approached  billion in  improved to just  billion in  then fell to  billion in  prompting the closure of some regional offices and another reduction in the workforce aside from a weak economy it was also becoming clear to management that graybar suffered from internal problems the company was losing market share on its traditional electrical business while unable to make desired progress on the newer communicationsdata products business improved as the economy recovered in the early s despite sales growing to  billion in  management decided to realign the business starting in january  forming two business groups one for electrical supplies and another devoted to the increasingly important commdata business that same year graybar formed the solutions providers alliance teaming up with wholesale distributors kaman industrial technologies wwr scientific products and vallen corporation to accommodate an aggressive new growth strategy graybar added  locations  employees and  salespeople from  to  it also improved its network of warehouses spending  million to construct  major new facilities that dramatically cut down on delivery time as a result of these investments the company was well positioned to take advantage of a strong economy in the final years of the s in  annual revenues topped  billion while profits almost doubled during this period improving from  million in  to  million in  the improvement in the commdata sector was of particular importance in  it accounted for just  percent of graybar sales but by  totaled  percent graybar engaged in some external growth making several acquisitions in  and  the largest being splane electric supply co a detroit michigan company with  million in annual sales  employees and six locations in  graybar revenues improved to  billion while net income topped  million to support further expansion of its nationwide distribution centers instrumental to the companys growth graybar placed a  million bond offering in the summer of  the largest financing effort in its history by this time nine of the  distribution centers started in  were operational and the remaining seven were only months away from opening once the system was in place graybar was able to achieve its longterm aim of being able to ship to customers within  hours throughout the united states a downturn in the economy however soon hurt business and forced management to finetune the companys strategy in  revenues fell to  billion and business continued to drop off in  and  to  billion and  billion respectively as it had done in the early s graybar opted to invest in its infrastructure in order to be ready to take advantage of the economy when it ultimately rebounded the company invested  million on new technology to provide customers with more detailed information on orders deliveries and payments at the same time it encouraged its  suppliers to implement a standardized bar code system to create an open central database similar to that found in the retail industry in this way graybar would distinguish itself from its rivals graduating from the role of middleman to a supply chain expert capable of adding value to the process once the new system was functional graybar hoped to be able to sell detailed reports to
