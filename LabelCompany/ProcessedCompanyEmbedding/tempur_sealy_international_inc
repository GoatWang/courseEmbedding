over  reviews want toknow more see our independentreviews from aroundthe web saatva mattress reviews rating    reviews published jan   by aaron  of  people found the following review helpful no regrets i was originally skeptical about making a mattress purchase online however after my experiences with saatva…i am very happy that i took the chance i purchased my saatva mattress in november  and felt it necessary to wait until now before posting a review i chose to write this simply because i relied on others reviews to help me make my decision to purchase and i hope it helps you if you are on the fence about making the plunge…so here you go i have had my mattress for a little over  days and i am in love the purchase was very simple and easy to complete online with no hidden fees throughout the process a few days after making my purchase i was sent an email containing details of my purchase and what to expect for delivery about  days after my purchase i received a phone call from the delivery company to set up a date and a time window for delivery the delivery company arrived when expected and was very professional the mattress and foundation were taken to an upstairs master bedroom and installed on my bed frame after they removed the old mattress and foundation i was worried about off gassing and chemical odors that are common with new mattresses and was quite surprised when this was not the case a few days after delivery i did have a question about the foundation and subsequently sent saatva an email within  minutes of sending my email i received a phone call from saatva with an answer to my question i have never had a company respond so fast to an email and to do so with a phone call…simply amazing the saatva representative was very responsive and nice and she quickly answered my questions offering her direct number if anything comes up and i should have more questions i give saatva’s customer service an a this is reassuring to me that they stand behind their product and are willing to go above and beyond to make their customers feel like they made the right decision so now about the mattress itself i purchased a king sized luxury firm and i gotta say that i have never had a better night’s sleep than i have had with my saatva mattress i wake up feeling refreshed with absolutely no back pain another thing i have noticed is that i dream more often which i believe means a more relaxing and deeper sleep i feel comfortable recommending this mattress to anyone who is looking at replacing theirs based on the quality of this mattress i am sure that it will last as long as saatva claims and even if there are problems i am sure that saatva’s awesome customer service will take great care of me if you are reading this wondering if you should take the chance on saatva…do it…i did and have absolutely no regrets was this review helpful to you yes no published feb   by drew p  of  people found the following review helpful drew peretzky if youre reading this review youve probably been in the mattress market for a while i spent hours online researching mattresses and came to realize what a racket this can be its impossible to compare products and all of them seem to have unhappy customers that have to jump through hoops to get any warranty satisfaction i suddenly noticed how many mattress stores there are not something that you notice until youre looking for one obviously there is a huge markup on a mattress or there wouldnt be so many vendors in the marketplace we actually went to a store  the numbers mattress store where you essentially inflate a bag to get the firmness you want  for big dollars fortunately my wife and i are the same number so we didnt really need the individual adjustability but we would never have gone for it anyway  the quality just wasnt there and the price was silly  even if you didnt add the hundreds of dollars worth of pillows and accessory options somehow i stumbled on the saatva site and read with some astonishment the endless  star reviews when i looked at the construction i was impressed with the quality features  no gimmicks the warranty is superior to any others and they actually honor it i could never imagine ordering such an important purchase over the internet  but i figured with the return policy i really couldnt lose we received our luxury firm mattress in early december and it has been wonderful i actually look forward to falling into bed every night the mattress itself was beautifully made of high quality materials the delivery process was totally smooth and professional two months later we couldnt be happier with the quality and comfort and the price is a bargain in my opinion i have only the highest praise for the product the service and the value for money btw this review is completely voluntary  i have not been solicited paid or in any way induced by saatva we all need to support and encourage the growth of usa made products especially when they are of exemplary qualitywas this review helpful to you yes no published feb   by carla r  of  people found the following review helpful best mattress ever i have been looking for the last couple of years for a mattress i was very nervous about making a decision because you really cant tell if you are going to like something by laying on it for  minutes in a store and very nervous about buying a mattress online sight unseen while on facebook i saw the advertisement for saatva i started looking into it and reading the reviews i liked the fact that it had coil on coil construction and not just memory foam i took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered the luxury firm king size with the  box frames this was the best decision ever i received it sooner than expected and we love it no more aches and pains when we get up in the morning according to a tracking device i recently received i was getting an average of    hours of sleep every night now with the new saatva i am getting    hours of sleep per night i would recommend anyone who has any doubt to just try it out i promise youll love itwas this review helpful to you yes no published nov   by bert p  of  people found the following review helpful everything they said it would be i waited until now to write a review now that ive had my mattress for a week first of all placing the order was a breeze i decided to call and place my order rather than place it on line all my questions were answered and confirmation came right away as well as a phone call thanking me for the order the delivery date came and we eagerly awaited delivery our delivery window was between pm and  pm when  came and went with no call from the carrier i contacted them unfortunately they were closed not knowing what to do i contacted saatva they went into action managed to get someone from the carrier and learned that it had been damaged in transit cory with saatva kept in contact with my and called at least  times giving me updates thanks cory for giving up your saturday evening to help a customer saatva apologized profusely and being customer focused compensated me for the delay they got right on it and we received our mattress a week ago saturday now the best part the mattress is unbelievably comfortable i too was a little leery ordering sight unseen but dont worry the product is terrific i love it the folks at saatva get it they know that the customer puts the money into the equation and their focus on making the customer happy is their primary concern both in service and quality buy a saatva youll sleep better at night was this review helpful to you yes no published nov   by joyce s  of  people found the following review helpful thank you saatva i received your mattess almost  weeks ago i had been nervous about ordering a mattress from an online store but i did alot of research before finally choosing a satvaa mattress i was replacing a mattress from a wellknown company it was a torture chamber from day  as i felt like i was sleeping on the side of a mountain about to fall in to an abyss within  years a piece of the frame plastic broke and i had to take the whole thing apart to fix the frame i was still sleeping on the side of a mountainthen the sides started to bulge out and the mattress would slide all over the base and the base would slide all over the floor there was no helpful customer support the mattress and base were made of shoddy materials the whole thing started to fall apart within  years and was wildly overpriced one of the air chambers finally popped and i was glad it did so i could get a traditional mattress and box spring the day my saatva mattress was to be delivered i took apart the old mattress and frame to toss it and when i unzipped the cover and lifted up the foam beneath it i found black mold under the foam and top of the air chambers i would have been delighted to sleep in a doggie bed at that point then the saatva arrived right on time and was delivered by polite and nice delivery men when they left i couldnt wait to put on sheets and try it out i could not believe how comfortable the bed was for the first time in years i could sleep on my stomach and sides without pain numbness and tingling i forgot to mention that i am loaded with atthritis and within the last  years have had to have  back surgeries  knee replacements and a right hip replacement bottom linei sleep like a baby on this mattress and i am so happy i decided to take a leap of faith and trust the company and their incredible customer service and return policy thanks saatvawas this review helpful to you yes no published jan   by glen  of  people found the following review helpful awesome back pain relieved we got our matress a few days ago my wife has been suffering from lumbar

for producing a quality product in america for a great price point thanks for the peace you have given to uswas this review helpful to you yes no published jun   by patrick burrows  of  people found the following review helpful sleep like the dead having slept fairly comfortably on midpricedmidquality mattresses purchased from sams club for the past  years my wife and i decided to finally take the plunge on a higher quality luxury mattress like so many other reviewers on this website we visited several local luxury mattress stores and were not pleased with either the construction quality or the sales experience so we decided to check online to see what was available and in all the research saatva kept coming up over and over again as one the highest rated mattress manufacturers in terms of comfort customer service and manufacturing quality after an afternoon of internet research we took the plunge and ordered the  inch luxury firm kingsized mattress as someone who has led an active athletic lifestyle i have had  knee surgeries serious spinalneck injuries and most recently i was recovering from shoulder surgery following the recovery from the shoulder surgery i was unable to return to our old tired bed because it was so uncomfortable i was so excited the day our saatva mattress arrived my wife and i couldnt wait to get the sheets on it and try it out the next few nights sleep and every night since then have been a revelation no longer do i toss and turn all night with all my various damaged and surgically repaired joints screaming at me sleeping on our new saatva mattress is like sleeping on a cloud you close your eyes and it feels like you are floating the moment you stretch out all the pressure points on all the old aching joints and injuries just disappear my wife and i both sleep so well on this mattress we dont even set an alarm any more lay down to sleep and then wake up  or  hours later more rested than you could ever imagine it made me realize how badly i had actually been sleeping on our old tired mattress the quality of this mattress and the entire buying experience couldnt have been any better the saatva mattress has literally changed my life i have run out of superlatives so i will wrap it up by saying thanks saatva was this review helpful to you yes no published jun   by sam  of  people found the following review helpful month review i am a very conscientious online shopper i did a pretty thorough job on researching mattresses along with comparison pricing it is a very very challenging exercise and i was very reluctant almost giving up in actually buying a mattress thats how tough it is i made the choice to go with saatva and after months the mattress is in the same condition it was when it first got delivered i purchased the ” and cannot express how much we look forward to going to bed at night as a reward for the day’s workwas this review helpful to you yes no pages                 dear valued customer

and felt it necessary to wait until now before posting a review i chose to write this simply because i relied on others reviews to help me make my decision to purchase and i hope it helps you if you are on the fence about making the plunge…so here you go i have had my mattress for a little over  days and i am in love the purchase was very simple and easy to complete online with no hidden fees throughout the process a few days after making my purchase i was sent an email containing details of my purchase and what to expect for delivery about  days after my purchase i received a phone call from the delivery company to set up a date and a time window for delivery the delivery company arrived when expected and was very professional the mattress and foundation were taken to an upstairs master bedroom and installed on my bed frame after they removed the old mattress and foundation i was worried about off gassing and chemical odors that are common with new mattresses and was quite surprised when this was not the case a few days after delivery i did have a question about the foundation and subsequently sent saatva an email within  minutes of sending my email i received a phone call from saatva with an answer to my question i have never had a company respond so fast to an email and to do so with a phone call…simply amazing the saatva representative was very responsive and nice and she quickly answered my questions offering her direct number if anything comes up and i should have more questions i give saatva’s customer service an a this is reassuring to me that they stand behind their product and are willing to go above and beyond to make their customers feel like they made the right decision so now about the mattress itself i purchased a king sized luxury firm and i gotta say that i have never had a better night’s sleep than i have had with my saatva mattress i wake up feeling refreshed with absolutely no back pain another thing i have noticed is that i dream more often which i believe means a more relaxing and deeper sleep i feel comfortable recommending this mattress to anyone who is looking at replacing theirs based on the quality of this mattress i am sure that it will last as long as saatva claims and even if there are problems i am sure that saatva’s awesome customer service will take great care of me if you are reading this wondering if you should take the chance on saatva…do it…i did and have absolutely no regrets was this review helpful to you yes no published feb   by drew p  of  people found the following review helpful drew peretzky if youre reading this review youve probably been in the mattress market for a while i spent hours online researching mattresses and came to realize what a racket this can be its impossible to compare products and all of them seem to have unhappy customers that have to jump through hoops to get any warranty satisfaction i suddenly noticed how many mattress stores there are not something that you notice until youre looking for one obviously there is a huge markup on a mattress or there wouldnt be so many vendors in the marketplace we actually went to a store  the numbers mattress store where you essentially inflate a bag to get the firmness you want  for big dollars fortunately my wife and i are the same number so we didnt really need the individual adjustability but we would never have gone for it anyway  the quality just wasnt there and the price was silly  even if you didnt add the hundreds of dollars worth of pillows and accessory options somehow i stumbled on the saatva site and read with some astonishment the endless  star reviews when i looked at the construction i was impressed with the quality features  no gimmicks the warranty is superior to any others and they actually honor it i could never imagine ordering such an important purchase over the internet  but i figured with the return policy i really couldnt lose we received our luxury firm mattress in early december and it has been wonderful i actually look forward to falling into bed every night the mattress itself was beautifully made of high quality materials the delivery process was totally smooth and professional two months later we couldnt be happier with the quality and comfort and the price is a bargain in my opinion i have only the highest praise for the product the service and the value for money btw this review is completely voluntary  i have not been solicited paid or in any way induced by saatva we all need to support and encourage the growth of usa made products especially when they are of exemplary qualitywas this review helpful to you yes no published feb   by carla r  of  people found the following review helpful best mattress ever i have been looking for the last couple of years for a mattress i was very nervous about making a decision because you really cant tell if you are going to like something by laying on it for  minutes in a store and very nervous about buying a mattress online sight unseen while on facebook i saw the advertisement for saatva i started looking into it and reading the reviews i liked the fact that it had coil on coil construction and not just memory foam i took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered the luxury firm king size with the  box frames this was the best decision ever i received it sooner than expected and we love it no more aches and pains when we get up in the morning according to a tracking device i recently received i was getting an average of    hours of sleep every night now with the new saatva i am getting    hours of sleep per night i would recommend anyone who has any doubt to just try it out i promise youll love itwas this review helpful to you yes no published nov   by bert p  of  people found the following review helpful everything they said it would be i waited until now to write a review now that ive had my mattress for a week first of all placing the order was a breeze i decided to call and place my order rather than place it on line all my questions were answered and confirmation came right away as well as a phone call thanking me for the order the delivery date came and we eagerly awaited delivery our delivery window was between pm and  pm when  came and went with no call from the carrier i contacted them unfortunately they were closed not knowing what to do i contacted saatva they went into action managed to get someone from the carrier and learned that it had been damaged in transit cory with saatva kept in contact with my and called at least  times giving me updates thanks cory for giving up your saturday evening to help a customer saatva apologized profusely and being customer focused compensated me for the delay they got right on it and we received our mattress a week ago saturday now the best part the mattress is unbelievably comfortable i too was a little leery ordering sight unseen but dont worry the product is terrific i love it the folks at saatva get it they know that the customer puts the money into the equation and their focus on making the customer happy is their primary concern both in service and quality buy a saatva youll sleep better at night was this review helpful to you yes no published nov   by joyce s  of  people found the following review helpful thank you saatva i received your mattess almost  weeks ago i had been nervous about ordering a mattress from an online store but i did alot of research before finally choosing a satvaa mattress i was replacing a mattress from a wellknown company it was a torture chamber from day  as i felt like i was sleeping on the side of a mountain about to fall in to an abyss within  years a piece of the frame plastic broke and i had to take the whole thing apart to fix the frame i was still sleeping on the side of a mountainthen the sides started to bulge out and the mattress would slide all over the base and the base would slide all over the floor there was no helpful customer support the mattress and base were made of shoddy materials the whole thing started to fall apart within  years and was wildly overpriced one of the air chambers finally popped and i was glad it did so i could get a traditional mattress and box spring the day my saatva mattress was to be delivered i took apart the old mattress and frame to toss it and when i unzipped the cover and lifted up the foam beneath it i found black mold under the foam and top of the air chambers i would have been delighted to sleep in a doggie bed at that point then the saatva arrived right on time and was delivered by polite and nice delivery men when they left i couldnt wait to put on sheets and try it out i could not believe how comfortable the bed was for the first time in years i could sleep on my stomach and sides without pain numbness and tingling i forgot to mention that i am loaded with atthritis and within the last  years have had to have  back surgeries  knee replacements and a right hip replacement bottom linei sleep like a baby on this mattress and i am so happy i decided to take a leap of faith and trust the company and their incredible customer service and return policy thanks saatvawas this review helpful to you yes no published jan   by glen  of  people found the following review helpful awesome back pain relieved we got our matress a few days ago my wife has been suffering from lumbar

for producing a quality product in america for a great price point thanks for the peace you have given to uswas this review helpful to you yes no published jun   by patrick burrows  of  people found the following review helpful sleep like the dead having slept fairly comfortably on midpricedmidquality mattresses purchased from sams club for the past  years my wife and i decided to finally take the plunge on a higher quality luxury mattress like so many other reviewers on this website we visited several local luxury mattress stores and were not pleased with either the construction quality or the sales experience so we decided to check online to see what was available and in all the research saatva kept coming up over and over again as one the highest rated mattress manufacturers in terms of comfort customer service and manufacturing quality after an afternoon of internet research we took the plunge and ordered the  inch luxury firm kingsized mattress as someone who has led an active athletic lifestyle i have had  knee surgeries serious spinalneck injuries and most recently i was recovering from shoulder surgery following the recovery from the shoulder surgery i was unable to return to our old tired bed because it was so uncomfortable i was so excited the day our saatva mattress arrived my wife and i couldnt wait to get the sheets on it and try it out the next few nights sleep and every night since then have been a revelation no longer do i toss and turn all night with all my various damaged and surgically repaired joints screaming at me sleeping on our new saatva mattress is like sleeping on a cloud you close your eyes and it feels like you are floating the moment you stretch out all the pressure points on all the old aching joints and injuries just disappear my wife and i both sleep so well on this mattress we dont even set an alarm any more lay down to sleep and then wake up  or  hours later more rested than you could ever imagine it made me realize how badly i had actually been sleeping on our old tired mattress the quality of this mattress and the entire buying experience couldnt have been any better the saatva mattress has literally changed my life i have run out of superlatives so i will wrap it up by saying thanks saatva was this review helpful to you yes no published jun   by sam  of  people found the following review helpful month review i am a very conscientious online shopper i did a pretty thorough job on researching mattresses along with comparison pricing it is a very very challenging exercise and i was very reluctant almost giving up in actually buying a mattress thats how tough it is i made the choice to go with saatva and after months the mattress is in the same condition it was when it first got delivered i purchased the ” and cannot express how much we look forward to going to bed at night as a reward for the day’s workwas this review helpful to you yes no pages                 dear valued customer
