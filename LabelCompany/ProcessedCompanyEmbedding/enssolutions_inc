and erosion for a whole new generation eco applications are extensive ranging from simple backyard trails and construction sites to heavylift military cargo runways once applied to the soil or aggregate the copolymer molecules coalesce forming bonds between the soil or aggregate particles the key advantage of eco polymer originates with its long nanoparticle molecular structure that link and crosslink together as the water dissipates from the soil or aggregate a durable and water resistant matrix of flexible solidmass is created once cured eco becomes completely transparent leaving

please contact us by phone at  or by email officeenssolutionscom terratop specialized pine pitch emulsion  amensadmin terra top is a unique blend of a lignin and top pine pitch emulsion that creates a long lasting road surface that holds up to rain and traffic at an economic discount from just a straight top pine pitch emulsion application in the sulfite process the lignins are sulfonated and become water soluble on their own they can leach or fail after a short period of time with traffic and rain but by adding top pine pitch emulsion it becomes a much stronger stabilizer this helps bind the lignin to the aggregate creating a non water soluble surface that is water resistant the lignin helps the pine pitch penetrate deeper into the surface to give the roadway a stronger more durable surface that will hold up to weather and traffic this blend will last longer than just regular lignin or lignin mixed with mag chlorides on their own here are some important facts and details – terratop meets or exceeds pm standards – improving travel safety – conserving water – constant watering no longer required – improving public relations – convenient application – can drive on the treated area next day – longterm cost savings – higher residual and reduced future application rates – nontoxic ingredients – not harmful to humans animals or plants – custom blends for specific climates or soil types – reduced carbon footprint – saves money on labor and equipment cost – reduces dust in agriculture areas where dust mites are a factor – fewer potholes and less wash boarding – increased low bearing capacity a firmer road surface without loose gravel   ens solutions inc all rights reserved  website bywwwgoshiftmediacom rapgsa paving – ens solutions tollfree   open menuabout
