call this morning ill begin with a highlevel summary of our first quarter results and financial activities before handing the call over to bert marchio for a more detailed review of our financial performance we began  with positive momentum driven primarily by substantial progress last year in our phase  newton  study of eg for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage weve continued that momentum and were very pleased that we remain on track with our previously stated anticipated timelines for our topline efficacy data from the interim analysis and if necessary the full data readout in the first quarter we also initiated our study assessing intracisternal delivery of eg for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage now before i provide details on our clinical progress i wanted to briefly comment on our recently completed registered direct offering of common stock that was sold at a premium to the market price without any advantageous features over common stock so this transaction was a result of an institutional investor conducted substantial due diligence and then taking a high level of interest in edge and also feeling that the stock was undervalued during that transaction we secured  million in gross proceeds from the transaction and this allows us to further strengthen our cash balance and provides the capital that will allow us to expedite precommercial activities for eg that we had previously planned to initiate after the newton  interim data readout moreover the financing provides additional financial flexibility to expand our product portfolio including advancing our early phase pipeline programs such as lumbar administration of eg eg for chronic subdural hematoma and some other potential opportunities at the same time this transaction allowed us to broaden our strong shareholder base with a new healthcare dedicated longterm focused institutional investor so now let me turn to our clinical programs so lets begin with our lead program eg for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage or the more common known  more commonly as a ruptured brain aneurysm remember that this is a catastrophic medical emergency associated with extremely high resource utilization both in the hospital and after discharge from the hospital this is a condition with poor clinical outcomes typically striking a patient population with an average age of  years old and right now only a single therapeutic treatment option available for patients stricken with this condition furthermore there been no new innovation or no new medicine to improve clinical outcomes in almost  years in our phase  newton  study were assessing eg administered through an external ventricular drain versus the standard of care oral nimodipine we designed the newton  study largely based on our promising phase  newton north american data so that is we got the same patient population the same competitor and the same assessment for efficacy although the newton  study is a doubleblind study so we aim to reproduce the positive efficacy and safety results seen in the phase  study now as a reminder eg is being developed under the us and the eu orphan drug and us fast track designation weve continued to make progress in newton  as weve increased patient enrollment and also activated additional clinical sites notably we are very excited to have activated our first clinical site in europe the european centers will now join many of the world centers of excellence for treating aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage for already active participant in our newton  study interest in the newton  study continues to be very strong around the world and globally and we now have a total  centers as of today opened for patient enrollment in the us europe and australasia its also important to know that many of these sites have experienced conducting clinical trials in subarachnoid hemorrhage and include most of the sites from the original newton study excuse me in the original newton study so this experience is very important to ensure selection of the appropriate patients and also to adhere to the study protocol also with newton  our emphasis right now continue to be on monitoring and training investigators and the clinical staff to ensure patient selection for the newton  study in addition we continue to provide x medical monitoring to field any questions from the investigators and the research coordinators so regarding the newton  milestones we remain on track with our previously stated anticipated timelines for our topline data readout from the prespecified interim analysis in the first quarter of  and for a readout of the topline results from the full study in late  so lets move on to the regulatory area so you saw today we showed in the press release that the pediatric committee of the european medicines agency recommended granting a productspecific waiver for eg across all subsets of the pediatric population this waiver allowed for a marketing authorization application filing without the requirement for the pediatric clinical studies so now for a quick update on the intracisternal and intrathecal development programs and these are aimed at enabling the eg administration through these other routes these other administration routes would also allow us to expand access to eg to those aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients who dont receive an ebd so during the quarter we initiated our controlled study evaluating intracisternal administration of eg now with this study were focusing on those patients that undergo microsurgical clipping for securing of the ruptured brain aneurism who are not otherwise eligible for newton  so again were focused on newton  enrollment but for those patients that are not eligible well look to enroll them in the cysternal study with eg so a little bit about that study this is a randomized controlled open label study its investigating the safety in the pharmacokinetic profile of eg injected directly into the basal cisterns in the brain during surgical repair of the aneurysm and were comparing this to oral nimodipine in a group of  adult subjects with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage so in this study nine subjects will receive treatment with eg while three subjects will receive standard of care oral nimodipine well also assess the clinical outcomes at  days of these patients moving forward to intrathecal or lumbar administration what this involves is delivering eg into the cerebrospinal fluid or the csf via a single injection into the lower back lumbar region of the spine we anticipate initiating an animal study mid and will look at the safety in the pk of delivering eg via the single lumbar puncture or injection and comparing it to the animal data that we have on file for the administration of either cysternal or intraventricular administration so with that ill turn the call over to bert marchio for our financial review bert marchio thank you brian as of march  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were  million and its down from  million at yearend a cash burn of approximately  million that was in line with our projections obviously our cash position has improved since quarter end because of the registered direct offering that brian described that brought in  million of gross proceeds research and development expenses for the quarter were  million inclusive of approximately  of noncash stock compensation expenses rd expenses in the first quarter reflected increased spending on our ongoing newton  study for eg as spending on other clinical programs and increases in personnel costs general and administrative expenses were  million for the first quarter including approximately  of noncash stock compensation expense ga spending during the first quarter reflected increased personnel costs nonrecurring executive separation costs stockbased compensation expenses facility costs and professional fees we reported a net loss of  million for the first quarter as of yesterday may  we had  million shares outstanding as we look ahead we expect operating expenses to increase as we continue adding sites and enrolling subjects in our newton  study of eg and as we continue to advance our other development programs including lumbar and cysternal and build our infrastructure based on our current plans we expect our cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to fund our operations through full data readout from our newton  study which as brian said is anticipated to occur in late  and now ill turn it back to brian brian leuthner thanks bert so in summary were executing our clinical plan for our phase  newton  study on target we continue to focus on activating additional study sites and ensuring the quality of the data and the patients that the sites enroll and were looking forward to the anticipated interim and full data readout from our newton  study in the first quarter of  or later in  respectively at the same time were making progress on our other development programs so with that thank you again for joining us today we appreciate your continued support and look forward to updating you as we continue to advance through newton  and our other development programs at edge therapeutics so operator were ready to take question now thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from paul matties leerink your line is open paul matties hey guys thanks so much for taking my questions i have a few the first one is on how many i am just curious if you can tell us how many patients youve enrolled in the us and outside of the us relative to your initial plan and how youre tracking relative to your expectations the second one is i would love to maybe just if you could talk a little bit about the intracysternal study and what you see as a successful outcome and how youre defining that in this study and then the third thing as youve talked a little  a lot about statistical power on the primary end point i am wondering how youre thinking about statistics on key secondary endpoints that may better convey pharmacoeconomic value like duration of icu stay duration of hospital stay thanks so much brian leuthner sure thanks paul for the question first one on patient enrolled we have not given that out what we just continue to say is were on track for the interim read out in the first quarter of  which is  subjects and also full data readout at the end of the year for  patients what we do have is weve now increased our clinical sites enrolling at  sites and as we mentioned we just got our first european site up in germany a few days ago so there continues to be tremendous excitement in europe so thats where we are on that cysternal as far as what would success look like the first thing obviously this is a safety and pharmacokinetic study so what we hope to do is just evaluate the safety of the drug given via cysternal administration and then look at that pk and were gathering data obviously from  we have our pk results from our earlier newton study when we administered eg intraventricularly so well be comparing them so i think thats really what we want to look at is are we getting similar levels in plasma and just compare it to what we have and obviously we are looking at the functional outcome using the glasgow outcome score extended in that study regarding the powering yes as you know weve spoken about this from a statistical standpoint were really focused on the primary endpoint which is the glasgow outcome score extended because obviously thats what fda cares about from a standpoint of approvability some of the secondary endpoints we are collecting but we really havent spoken about the statistics around that but were keenly looking as you mentioned the icu length of stay the total hospital length of stay where patients actually go after they go out of the hospital because as you know in the first newton study patients on oral nimodipine is a standard of care they were in the icu meeting in  days in the hospital for  days and still two thirds of the people ended up going to rehab so we want to understand that and were also looking at other measures that look at the really intensity of care intensity of treatment on the hospital so as we get all of this health economic data well be able to make what we feel is a strong argument if the data continue to look like what we saw in the newton study does that answer your questions paul paul matties yes great thanks so much brian really appreciate it brian leuthner thank you paul operator thank you our next question is from jason butler of jmp securities your line is open jason butler hi thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all the progress two questions first of all can you give us a sense of what proportion of patients you expect to enroll in newton  from the us versus europe and australasia and then talk about any differences in how these patients are managed in the different countries and then the second question you talked about how the increased cash position provides the opportunity to advance some earlier stage programs any plans at this point to broaden the use of the delivery platform to molecules beyond nimodipine thanks brian leuthner sure thanks jason first question is whats our assumption on the proportion of patients in i would say north america we look as really north america and ex north america and right now based on our assumptions we believe that were going to have i think more patients in the us because we started a little earlier on the sites in the us and north america we dont know exactly that split as we start to see the enrollment numbers coming in from europe but we essentially  in our assumptions when were looking at the modeling we were thinking that the percent of patients enrolled per site would be roughly equal between ex north america and north america so again ill probably next quarter be able to provide a little bit more insight as we start to see how well europe enrolls now the thing that we do know generally about the european sites are these are really high enrolling excuse me high volume centers because in europe its much  its even more concentrated efforts from the centers of excellence so the volume the subarachnoid hemorrhage volume at these centers that were doing is on average higher in europe also if we are looking at the interim analysis clearly we would expect many more as a percentage of patients to be in the north american centers because were looking at  but then that  getting closer to even out when we go  so thats why were looking at from that perspective i believe i wrote down your second question jason if you can remind me what that was again jason butler just if you have any plans at this point with the additional cash you now have to expand the use of the delivery platform to other molecules brian leuthner yes yes we do we think precisa is a very good way to be our engine for future value creation eg we dont spend as much time on that that is taking a different api drug called aprotinin and using it in the chronic subdural hematoma population so this population is another orphan population we believe sill a little bigger than the aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from a patient population but again theres no therapy out there to really help in that population and were using precisa and again looking at targeted and sustained release delivery using precisa so we do expect and we do plan to look at other precisabased products and develop our portfolio jason butler great thanks again for taking the questions brian leuthner thank you jason operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from vamil divan of credit suisse your line is open vamil divan great good morning guys thanks for taking my questions just two if i could so one you talked about the interim analysis earlier next year and then before the final just in terms of managing expectations can you just give us a sense of how much we should focus on interim and your interim planning how much are you focusing on interim potential being positive versus just having to go through the end of the study again just in terms of managing investor expectations as we get closer to that and then second just on the cost side or the pricing side of this equation obviously the data is going to drive things but wondering when we might have more insight from you guys around what you think is reasonable in terms of pricing if there is other additional survey work or updated thoughts you have there beyond what youve shared previously that would be helpful just give us a sense of how to model things thanks brian leuthner sure thank you vamil so the first question is interim analysis and here is how we look at it and obviously we have the plan that were going to hit at the interim analysis that we clearly now that its a hurdle if you look at the newton  or newton data there was a  absolute difference between the proportion of subjects that had a favorable outcome that were treated with eg verses those that were treated with oral nimodipine so we have  delta to win at the interim we would need to show approximately a  difference in the proportion of favorable outcome and then as we talked about before if you look at the full study we need to show around  to  difference at the full study so again we need to show a  difference the difference is this is a blinded study the newton  versus the open label phase  or excuse me the open label original newton study so again i believe we could show a difference or won the built but its not a slamdunk by any means so on one hand from a financial perspective were planning to go all the way out to the full data readout but from an operational standpoint here well were planning if we hit it we want to be ready so that we can get the regulatory documents in if we hit at the interim we want to make sure that we have our precommercial activities started so thats really how we look at it from our perspective regarding health economics we talked about this probably the best article we look at from a health economic standpoint as a foundation is this article published in  at the duke university medical center that you showed that those patients that had a deterioration cost  more on direct hospital costs than if they did not deteriorate and this is in  so thats our baseline to say what is the intensity of care for these patient in the hospital but then also looking at the full course of care when they leave the hospital because as i mentioned in our prepared statements the average age is  years old so this is a managed care population so the hospital costs the rehab costs and then what were trying to do here is take people or young population and get them back to work from the outcome standpoint so its a really complex and intense digging of information thats really never been done except for that one article and that one article back in  just focused on the inpatient cost so dan brandon and his group is really digging down were working with some of these companies that have the data mining capabilities were working with the brain and years of foundation and talking to patients and caregivers so we hope to have at least provide more data in the next few quarters to give you that but all the signals are showing us clearly that we can replicate what we saw in newton were going to have a very very strong health economic argument for this young patient population because essentially what were doing if we can prevent these delayed complications and have people have a favorable outcome and again you may remember from the newton study almost a third of the patients had a glasgow outcome score extended of an eight at  days which means they are basically almost back to normal thats a substantial impact on these patients and could reduce expenses over the whole continuum of care so were looking into it its very very complicated these things that were doing all the signs say this medicine can really provide a very strong rationale of wanting  having payers want to pay for this to help the patients and also reduce cost in an institution so thats what were doing from the health economics vamil divan okay thanks so much brian leuthner thank you vamil operator thank you our next question is from it are sick of ed arce of hc wainwright and company your line is open ed arce great thank you guys for taking my questions and congrats on all the recent progress just a couple questions on the main study newton  if you could just remind us another something you went over recently but if you could remind us in relation to newton  any differences in inclusion criteria and in particular in the endpoint with regards to pharmacoeconomic benefit that you just discussed brian leuthner sure thanks for the question so i am starting across our chief medical officer and when i ask them after the first newton study how can we do everything we can to ensure that we see the same results that dont change anything so from our phase  to our phase  essentially the only difference is that the phase  is a doubleblind double dummy study so what is the same is the same inclusion criteria so that wfns two through four so wfns is a measure of consciousness when they come into the hospital and patients with they have to have an external ventricular drain to give the drug so thats identical the competitor is eg versus oral nimodipine so thats the same and the primary endpoint is the glasgow outcome score extended which is in the cup point is the six seven or eight determines a favorable optimum so were looking at the proportion of favorable outcome of eg versus oral nimodipine and that has been the same so everything has been the same the same thing we are looking at some lets call the health economic drivers first and foremost is if these patients deteriorate in this kind of three to day window many people have to get this intervention called rescue therapy and rescue therapy is expensive its timeconsuming and its only marginally effective if you look at what we did in the newton study we reduced rescue therapy by almost  so we are looking at that were looking at icu length of stay which we decreased by  days from the median perspective in the first phase  study and were looking at the overall hospital length of stay which again we decreased by  days in the newton study and were actually tracking whether these patients go home or they go to rehab because clearly as everyone knows spending time in a rehab facility is very expensive for the hospitals as well so with that the only changes were making are again its a blinded study in regard to  centers to roughly  centers but the randomization and its a onetoone randomization in the phase  study versus a  to  randomization in the phase  study and obviously we did it  to  because we wanted to get more information about eg in that phase  study but otherwise everything else is similar and thats why were spending so much time on the quality of working with the sites to make sure that everyone is aligned and educated on the inclusion and exclusion criteria as weve gone out to a broader hospitalbase ed arce okay great and the other question that i had is on the intracysternal study that you mentioned some of these patients as you mentioned dont qualify for the newton  it would be helpful if you could just review some of those differences and in particular again the endpoint that you look to measure especially since theres been very little study in this area especially there brian leuthner sure so the intracysternal study so if you look at patients one thing they want to do and these patients have aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage or a ruptured brain is the first thing they want to do is secure the aneurysm and they will do that obviously for a couple ways use endovascular procedures to security aneurysm or though undergo microsurgical clipping so in cysternal study what were looking to studying and doctors all the time come to us and they say if i were a patient that i need to clear i access to see right into the area and the basal assistance underneath the brain why couldn’t i inject the medicine directly into the basal cisterns so thats really quote “what were answering” this is really customerdriven on what were doing and so these patients would be wfns ones and twos they would not be eligible for the newton  study because especially for the wfns s they would not have an external ventricular drain the endpoint were looking at are similar to what we did in the phase  newton study so we want to look at pk were going to look at obviously safety and then were also going to look at in this population were going to look at the glasgow outcome score extended at  days and compare the two sides were also going to be looking at rescue therapy were going to be looking at vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia were going to look at infarction although these are  were looking at  subjects here well also be looking at length of stay and pretty much everything that we looked at in the newton study were just taking this to a cysternal administration and again this will be for those patients that if the medicine works and gets approved with external ventricular drain this will be another option for doctors that may not have access for patients that may not be able to get this but undergo microsurgical clipping so thats why were doing is really based on customer demand and were looking at the pk safety and then we will be looking at the efficacy endpoints that we looked at in the newton phase  study ed arce okay sounds good and congrats again on all the progress brian leuthner thank you very much thanks for the question operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call over to brian leuthner for any closing remarks brian leuthner sure no i just want to thank
