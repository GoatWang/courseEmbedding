securities will fluctuate in response to general economic conditions and to changes in the prospects of particular companies andor sectors in the economy investments in small and midcap companies involve greater risks not associated with investing in more established companies such as business risk significant stock price fluctuations and illiquidity investing in international securities generally poses greater risk than investing in domestic securities including greater price fluctuations and higher transaction costs special risks are inherent to international investing including those related to currency fluctuations and foreign political and economic events with respect to certain foreign countries there is a possibility of nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation imposition of withholding or other taxes and political or social instability that could affect investments in those countries the securities markets of emerging countries tend to be less liquid especially subject to greater price volatility tend to have smaller capitalization companies less government regulation and may not be subject to as extensive and frequent accounting financial and other reporting requirements as securities issued in more developed countries further investing in the securities of issuers located in certain emerging countries may present a greater risk of loss resulting from problems in security registration and custody or substantial economic or political disruptions no investing strategy can overcome all market volatility or guarantee future results
