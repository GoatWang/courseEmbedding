schedules management uses these nonus gaap measures in monitoring and evaluating the ongoing performance of woodward and each business segment now turning to our results net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year  were  million an increase of  compared to  million in the second quarter of  earnings per share were  for the second quarter of  compared to  in the second quarter of  aerospace segments sales grew  and earnings increased  while industrial segment sales and earnings decreased  and  respectively as compared to the prior year quarter now i’ll turn the call over to tom to comment further on our results strategies and market thomas gendron thank you don and good afternoon to those joining us today half way through fiscal  our results are largely inline with our expectation for the second quarter aerospace segment performance was very strong offsetting some of the weaker industrial segment performance compared to the prior year as anticipated we continued our shift from investment to cash generation cycle delivering significant growth in free cash flow this quarter now i’ll turn trends for our aerospace and industrial segment online with our growth strategies record commercial aircraft backlog support healthy production levels for the next decade and industrial application initial regulations as well as increased availability and favorable price in the natural gas are expected to drive long term growth in the natural gas utilization talking to our market in some more detail our aerospace market remain strong our commercial sales are accelerating benefitting from the introduction of the next generation program airbus aneo continues to ramp up and the boeing  max is up to the launch in the coming months account on both these programs has more than doubled from previous generation commercial aftermarket community is robust driven by strong growth and global passenger traffic which through february  was up  yearoveryear as well as improving global indiscernible this positions for the new platforms is also a contributor commercial craft and business jet markets remain weak and we are anticipating a near term recovery defense activity both oem and aftermarket continues to be strong fueled by global and the rest and growing international defense budget potentially end sales benefitted from growth in smart weapon while aftermarket sales were up as results of rising maintenance budget aircraft service life expansion and major upgrade programs turning to industrial macroeconomic indicators continued to point strength in industrial market in the latter half of the calendar year and we are seeing some positive order activity in our early cycle product family the power generation activity related to natural gas reciprocating engine showed improvement and our order volume is increasing industrial gas turbine oem sales remain flat aftermarket sales for industrial gas turbines have been strong for some time now at this quarter we saw some downward pressure wind turbine converter sales were off the leak and transportation we are pleased to see the second consecutive quarter of meaningful improvements international gas fuel systems for trucks in asia and we expect this trend to continue in oil and gas the price of oil has settled above  a barrel and we are seeing signs of stabilization in summary as we look ahead to the balance of fiscal  we expect the positive momentum in aerospace to continue and the industrial segment to have a stronger second half while uncertainty remains many of our industrial markets remain confident in our overall fiscal year guidance now let me turn it over to bob to discuss the financials in more detail robert weber thank you tom as tom previously mentioned our yeartodate results were largely consistent with our expectations however in the second quarter aerospace performance was stronger and industrial was weaker than we expected in aerospace sales increased  this quarter with strength across most of the segment rotorcraft business and sales were the only area of commercial weakness consistent with our expectations combined commercial aftermarket sales for the quarter which includes aftermarket sales made through the joint venture were up  compared to the prior year quarter putting us to about  growth yeartodate this is now more inline with our fullyear commercial aftermarket expectation up midsingle digit growth defense sales were also strong across the board with smart weapons growth accelerating in the quarter and anticipated continue growing throughout the fiscal year aerospace segment earnings for the quarter were  of sales compared to  in the same period last year the improvement was driven largely by the higher sales volume turning to industrial second quarter industrial segment sales up  million were down  compared to the second quarter of fiscal  while we appeared to be at the bottom of the cycle for a number of our endmarkets and see improving orders for the second half of the year we still experience some pockets of decline most notably in wind turbine converters and aftermarket sales for industrial gas turbines in the quarter we saw improved sales of natural gas fuel systems used on trucks in asia and on reciprocating engine power generation applications second quarter industrial segment earnings were  of sales compared to  in the prior year period segment earnings were unfavorably impacted by lower sales volume and plant cost associated with the new facility which collectively more than offset the cost savings from strategic initiatives previously implemented we expect marked improvement in our industrial segment performance in the second half of the year largely driven by a return to sales growth in a number of markets we also continue to expect fullyear margin improvement of  basis point to  basis points in the industrial segment on sales growth in the second half and as a result of various cost savings initiatives mentioned previously at the woodward level gross margin percentage for the second quarter of  was  compared to  in the prior year period research and development cost were  of sales in the second quarter compared to  in the prior period selling general and administrative expenses were  of sales in the second quarter compared to  of sales in the prior period largely due to the timing of recognition of stockbased compensation expense for the six month period sga expenses were  of sales compared to  in the prior year period the effective tax rate for the second quarter of  was  compared to  for the second quarter of  our fullyear effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately  and favorable outcomes of certain tax matters looking in cash flows we generated  million of cash from operations for the first half of fiscal  compared to  million in the prior year period free cash flow for the first half of  was  million compared to  million in the similar period in the prior year the prior year period included  million from the formation of the joint venture with ge capital expenditures were  million for the first half of  compared to  million in the same period of the prior year in the second quarter of fiscal  we repurchased shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  million a total of  million yeartodate lastly turning to our  outlook as previously mentioned our overall first half performance is largely as expected with strength in aerospace and some weakness in industrial we anticipate based on current order volume and other indicators that our industrial business will improve in the second half however significant uncertainty remains in many of our industrial markets and we now expect industrial sales to be down slightly for the fullyear overall our fiscal year  guidance remains unchanged net sales are expected to increase by approximately  to  from the prior year and earnings per share are expected to be between  and  this includes our comments on the business and results for the second quarter of fiscal  operator we are now ready to open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from gautam khanna from cowen and company your line is open gautam khanna hey thank you good afternoon thomas gendron good afternoon robert weber hi gautam khanna so a couple of questions the first one i was wondering if at either segments but aerospace in particular if there were any onetime benefit as you had in q and if in the guidance generally you are anticipating any one time items that are either positive or negative in the remaining quarters robert weber yes nothing we knows that a small gain of sales of product line in the first quarter nothing like that this quarter there are always small significantly small items that occur in any given quarter we had most notably maybe the facility expenses that are probably a good example of that so weve been trying to call out and give you a feel for other than that no there is nothing significant gautam khanna okay obviously the tax rate previously was guided i think at  and today its been updated to  what im just curious about why not change the range the earnings per share range by the result in  sum variance or nine sum variance was there anything else that changed in the guidance or below the line or elsewhere robert weber right so yes we mentioned overall at the woodward level no change underneath that though we did mentioned that aero is looking stronger and industrial is weaker at this point while we do see signs of improvement in industrial that is where all the uncertainty currently lies and thats why we left the range where it is currently so we do still see a lot of uncertainty on the industrial side i might want to also point out that weve been working really hard addressing the industrial recession and many of the cost actions that weve been taking our focused on that so we do still anticipate the  basis points to  basis points improvement in industrial earnings as we go through the year even if we do end up being down slightly on sales gautam khanna okay could you also just maybe expand on your comments about the industrial gas turbine aftermarket being a little softer maybe how much softer and are there any specific things you can attribute it to be an advanced gas pass upgrades flowing or was it daytoday maintenance or was it across all oem any flavor you can give us on that robert weber yes right now i would say is we always have quartertoquarter variability in all of our aftermarket activities it was primarily around upgrades and retrofit where we saw this decline yearoveryear its uncertainty that its just timing or where that market is going so at the moment it was yearoveryear down and were monitoring the work those customers closely to see how the rest of the year roll out best half gautam khanna and was it across many oems or one in particular robert weber it was i would say across the market weighted by in our various market shares with each customers gautam khanna right okay and just an update on the aero segment margin guidance i think previously you said it be flat but slightly up i just want to be clear just trying to be a little better it sounds is there an update to that segment level guide and margin thomas gendron no update at this time as you point out we said up slightly to flat we are currently up with head cold slightly and no reason to believe that that wont continue but as you guys have already seen aftermarket volatility can go both ways for us so at this point no change overall aero appears to be doing a little bit better than expected at this point in time gautam khanna thank you guys ill get back in the queue i appreciate it thomas gendron thank you robert weber thanks operator okay thank you our next question comes from michael ciarmoli from suntrust michael your line is open michael ciarmoli hey good evening guys thanks for taking my question thomas gendron sure michael ciarmoli maybe just to followup on what gautam was going down here on the industrial so to get that  basis points of margin expansion it looks like second half year is going to have to average roughly  and im just trying obviously youve taken cost out of the business im trying to engage the confidence level there especially in the context if now there is a little bit of weakness in the aftermarket and maybe thinking that those are sort of your higher margin sales i mean is that run rate you guys haven’t been at that margin level in quite some time im just trying to i guess calibrate the confidence level there thomas gendron yes id say were quite confident in achieving the margin expansion in second half or see more of the cost savings that we initiated come through secondly sales in the second half will be higher than the first half then well get positive leverage on that and we continue with our new factories to drive productivity so combination of all of those we have confidence that we will deliver the number michael ciarmoli okay quite i guess based on the filings from last quarter i mean those cost saves you were getting about  million run rate is that kind of what you guys were looking for in those cost savings should we see an acceleration of that robert weber well you see some acceleration has kind of everything starts to flow through but thats a reasonable number its not going to be significantly changed from that as we go quartertoquarter michael ciarmoli okay thomas gendron but we took the actions at different points in time during the year and as time sets so theyll accelerate a little bit as we get into the second half michael ciarmoli okay and then just on aerospace i mean great performance there just can you maybe help frame us or frame the risk around whats been happening with the aneo engine i think around some of the  that theres been some combust or i think issues there are you guys seeing any rework or are you guys seeing any risk to those specific component in the engine where they are all having some i guess growing pains or teething issues thomas gendron i think thats why look at the neo its in total the whole a program to be honest i think everybody on the call recognizes we have very good content on the current generation a and increased content on the neo were on both the current generation and the neo run both engines airbus is continuing to ramp their production and well they have hick ups and peer power engine they’re substituting the other aircraft in so we see that the full year outlook for sales would be closing and we could be having our customers depending on proms we’re already doing that that’s part of we’re coming on that but overall we think  sales are going to hold through full year based on the balance between the engines and the two generations of the program michael ciarmoli got it and you don’t really see any cost risk there thomas gendron i don’t michael ciarmoli okay perfect i’ll jump back in the queue thanks guys operator thank you our next question is from robert spingarn from credit suisse your line is open for questions robert spingarn thanks at the risk of beating a dead horse on this industrial thing i just want to understand where your visibility comes from for the second half i mean it seems like the it seems up markets but down overall revenues for industrial and also seems like some of the pieces are moving in different directions then they were so the aftermarket in gas turbine on the one hand going down sounds a little surprising natural gas is up again also maybe a bit surprising so if you could talk about the confidence and the visibility on where this comes from that’s my first question thomas gendron good question we’re happy to continue with these questions around the major drive to us as well i’m going to start first with we do a lot of economic modeling and looking at a lot of economic deal and particularly in industrial production in us and all the major countries in the world what we’re seeing is industrial production is picking up but we’ve been indicators in a macro level appointing to a strong second half of the calendar year to industrial application with that macro  from that we start looking and we do have what we would call vast cycle and long cycle businesses some of our vast cycle businesses are around are reciprocating engine application the reason that’s vast cycle is there are going into something like construction equipment like truck natural gas trucks or items that don’t take long term projects that’s why they are vast cycle if you take like big steam turbines or industrial gas turbines they’re long cycle because you got the whole project cycle okay so that’s the different so what we’re seeing tied to that economic data is that vast cycle businesses the order intake is raising nicely and that’s where bob highlighted on our natural gas truck application our natural gas power gen those are going up some of the retrofit activities is going up so that would correlate in our mind very well and our tracks history the economic indicators moving our fast cycle moving and then our cycle businesses trail so that gives lot of confidence that we are seeing this turn and things are moving up robert spingarn if i could interrupt there on the vast cycle stuff what is the duration of backlog i mean can you see a quarter ahead two quarters thomas gendron so we are seeing about six months on that six to nine months we are seeing that it is that business is rising robert spingarn okay thomas gendron okay so now to continue to answer your question our wind business did go down as bob highlighted that i would say is primarily tied to market share of our customers and we cant really go to individual ones but we ride the market with our customers based on the applications we are on and i want to say is the overall wind market is doing okay it just happens to be a fourth quarter for our customer base and ourselves into that customer base the gas turbine aftermarket is probably the one that it gets everybodys attention and thats what we are saying we had big – a bigger first quarter and a low second quarter here so it could be timing but we are also concerned about the sustainability and the high rate we are running and that one is a little harder for us to correlate economic data and other activities so if you look at the balance of our business thats why we feel like we are seeing things turned up but we do have issue we can go back to gas service we cant forecast oem how that tracks with economic indicators would power utilization around the world things like that but the aftermarket is little more volatile so thats the balance what we are looking at and thats little bit why we see the second half taking up we have confidence in the vast cycle business we do have confidence in the economic indicators so we think we are seeing that turn however we have these two negatives wind and gas turbine aftermarket that have bided this quarter robert spingarn okay and then my other question bob this is for you going back to cash flow i thought capex was a little lighter than expected in the quarter and maybe free cash flow you are trying to handle you still looking for the same components of free cash flow for this period so i guess around  million for the year capex around one ten or is there any changes there robert weber no all of the differences are just timing related we are still getting the large project mode so timing and payment so forth so no those still hold robert spingarn okay alright thank you guys operator thank you and we will take our next question from peter skibitski from drexel hamilton go ahead with your question peter skibitski good afternoon guys tom is when that fast cycle or long cycle thomas gendron we would put wind more into the long cycle peter skibitski okay go ahead thomas gendron the timing to setup the wind park it does take that time is longer and thats why we put it in the long cycle peter skibitski okay so i am guessing that you had some visibility to the quarter and it maybe the visibility for the year and that bad either is i would assume would be flat for the year is that a bad assumption now thomas gendron that would be a bad assumption its going to be down for the full year peter skibitski okay so the gas turbine aftermarket is the real uncertainty factor here thomas gendron yes thats good clarification yes the wind we definitely see being down from full year gas turbine aftermarket the drop we had third quarter run it maybe down for the full year we just dont know that at this point peter skibitski okay is there any way or should we extrapolate wind into  having another down year there or they are up opportunities for regain share of the customer level thomas gendron we see some opportunities we are looking at new applications and new projects and there is a good chance that it will pick up in  again peter skibitski okay okay just a couple last small questions i guess that the resolution hasnt really impacted you yet do you fear the potential for full year continue resolution or i guess maybe giving your aftermarket exposure is that just not a concerning factor for you thomas gendron what i would say for when you are looking at fiscal year  we have a lot of confidence the defense will be up mid single digit and we are confident that with the order book and the like if we get a better distance project that can improve and it definitely would be momentum going into  peter skibitski okay got it and then just for bob the stock comp surprised me a little bit whats your fullyear expectation for corporate expense now robert weber well we are probably going to hold that rate a bit it may come down a little bit in the second half but the overall rate that you see now for last couple of quarters will probably hold yeartodate you kind of saw the stock comp it doesnt have that much of an impact very small yeartodate its mostly something thats usually in the first quarter and ended up being the second quarter and it was not significant in the quarter it was about  so it had an impact in the quarter thats totally related to – this time it had to go through a vote in our shareholder meeting which is in the second quarter so thats the reason why it changed normally it does not require the vote and this time just for administrative purposes it did and thats why its in the second quarter peter skibitski okay so you end up being around  million or so for the fullyear that alright robert weber thats not too far off peter skibitski okay thanks guys operator okay thank you our next question comes from sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies  company inc your line is open sheila kahyaoglu hi good afternoon guys thomas gendron hi sheila sheila kahyaoglu hey i’ve few questions i was wondering if you could quantify the commercial oe growth within aerospace just what you are seeing maybe with the different platforms on the indiscernible in particular thomas gendron the commercial what i am sorry sheila sheila kahyaoglu the commercial oe growth thomas gendron oe growth well overall we look at usually its about overall oe side and it started to pick up with the new platform coming as you know we have  had called down the line rates we dont see anything different in the call down but overall oe is picking up and its picking up to ramp in the launching of these new programs and we are always little head up deliveries we got to get our product to manufacturer first so we are seeing a pick up and we are going to continue to see oe pickup as we go through the year sheila kahyaoglu okay so it was the growth maybe high single digit nothing but just wanted to get an idea okay and i know we might more of the facility business but just on the a and  max can you talk about where you are in capacity realization and maybe on the ramp as to the finance thomas gendron well in terms of capacity utilization the plants and hopefully i am glad you will be on the tour all others will be there but the plants were designed the physical structures were designed to handle the maximum volume and like  so when you see the facilities you are going to see that there space like we put in our target is to be fixed nine months ahead of the ramp with equipment and with our number hiring and like so when you are going to see we are well ahead of the ramp and we will be able to make all the deliveries comfortably going forward no capacity concerns sheila kahyaoglu okay and you would say you are about six to nine months ahead on the neo versus the max at this point thomas gendron i guess you have to see a lot of our equipment a lot of it is going to run on the same lines so we are building line capacity for the forecast and maybe it wasnt clear we are trying to have the capacity on ready six to nine months ahead of the steps in the ramp rates that way everything we had no issue with meeting the committed ramp rates sheila kahyaoglu no understood thomas gendron okay sheila kahyaoglu and then just i guess lastly stepping back whether you think about aero business or within industrial are there you have had significant aero wins you won ha turbine last year with te can you talk about what you are maybe bidding on where the most activity that you are seeing throughout the company thomas gendron well right now great deal of our we have a lot of rd going into development of the x we are also working on the next generation turbine programs that are out there in the aerospace side we are doing some rd on looking at our market share expansion and product line expansion so thats without going into detail there for competitive reasons we are looking so that the next generation of programs that we can increase our content again on the industrial side we are seeing a lot of activity around dual fuel and alternative fuel or variety of fuel types so some of those programs are coming back and we are investing again in those areas so those are some of the primary plus some of our growth initiatives that as i said we are looking at how to expand the business with our organic expansion sheila kahyaoglu got it thomas gendron those are prime ones we are also participated in looking at both boeing air about the next generation aircraft or just middle of the market but we are involved in those activities as they are trying to figure out where those planes are going to be positioned and what time of the year but we are working on that activity as well sheila kahyaoglu okay understood thanks a lot tom appreciated operator okay operator instruction and i am showing one question left from indiscernible from stephens your line is open unidentified analyst yes hey guys thanks for taking the time quick question on industrial gas turbine aftermarket again i am curious is there a historical correlation where when utility see under utilization from that normally one that maybe you see a correlation and pull back in aftermarket demand is that something you seen historically thomas gendron yes there is a seasonality to the gas turbine aftermarket which would be tied to planned outages on those outages usually before you get to summer season where you are going to have high power use summer season everybody air conditioning so usually you see it advance that so thats usually the seasonality around outages so we track outages we try to help our forecasting capability and working with our customers to see where they are the other one is people working on emission regulation or if they are not compliant and they have to do an upgrade to get compliant that could also drive the timing of the aftermarket unidentified analyst okay and then on the  growth in aftermarket what would you attribute to legacy platform growth for initial provision thomas gendron yes we had a real healthy mix this quarter we are i think bob mentioned earlier we are seeing initial provisioning for the new programs starting which is as anticipated and the initial piercing is ramping up but the programs we are on have some  and some of the sweet spots in the aftermarket we are talking about  where the a program itself the b the g all these are hidden great timing in their repaired overhaul cycles and we are seeing that coming through and we have a legacy thats going well so it was a mix across the board there but as we are highlighting we continue to see aftermarket being strong going forward but tied to that shop visit rates as well as ongoing initial provisioning that will occur for a number of years here unidentified analyst okay and then just last one from me in terms of capital deployment i think you got  million authorization in place how kind of aggressive do you plan on being over the next  to  months and any increase appetite maybe actively start looking at thomas gendron well we are both bob and i comment on that later first okay robert weber later first okay well on the ma yes our ma approach is really targeted in with a lot of patience we get acquisitions that did with our strategic plan that would either enhance our system strategy or bring new technologies to us and we are constantly looking but we are extremely patience to get the right asset at the right price so its always really uncertain when you could time that and we want to make sure that we have the balance sheet to be able to do that but you can never exactly predict the timing outside of that we are going to go back to our capital deployment strategy with – thomas gendron yes i wouldnt call us any more aggressive we are not aggressive in that second half as we go forward we always have strategy of offsetting dilution we will continue that strategy a lot obviously depends on where the stock price is as we go through the year and we love to see it up high and that kind of keeps us a little bit out of the market when its up at the higher level so hopefully that will continue but as part of it also as we go forward people ask why are you going to let cash pile up on the balance sheet and no so then the balance between those comment and ma and availability of opportunities there and where cash sits will be determined what we do with that i call it “excess cash” robert weber and we are committed to dividend growth rate that we highlighted and we are going to continue to make sure we follow on that unidentified analyst right alright thanks guys best of luck operator thank you and our next question is from gautam khanna from cowen and company please go ahead you can check your mute button you may have muted your phone gautam khanna hi sorry about that couple of followup questions i was wondering if you could quantify how many leap equivalent ship sets you have already shipped into the channel and how thats going to progress through the year so if you have a number that would be helpful and like what counter q rate was how many shipped secondly on the pw if you had any update on that as well you can quantify for us thomas gendron yes i guess little bit thats sometimes sensitive information for our customers and i would rather defer that they provide that data not us but i cant tell you its both programs are ramping up and obviously the leap is ramping quickly on the neo we are getting ready to launch the max so that thats going to have a very steep ramp they are making progress and we were planning and position ourselves to handle the full ramp rate that airbus is planning so around that i am confident that they are going to get over the issues they had and going forward we are just preparing for the step change that thats both boeing and airbus are planning gautam khanna maybe if you are not willing to quantify it could you at least give us some color on what the lead time is for woodward how far have you shipped relative to when they deliver thomas gendron yes when we are in full rhythm it will be four to six months in advance to the aircraft being delivered gautam khanna and where is it now thomas gendron pardon sorry gautam khanna where is it now looking four to six months or you are saying down the road four to six thomas gendron right now its forward towards the six months and basically we shipped we do direction airbus and boeing but the ones that when you are trying to leap and pure power goes first you have to go to engine manufacture go to their build cycle and go to and then deliver the air frame or so its a little bit longer on those i hope you are going to come to our facility tour you are going to get real feel for how the rhythm of the production is and the flow and you get a feel for that if you are able to make the tour gautam khanna thats great but to be clear six months ahead is sort of where you are relative to where they are delivering so right now you are delivering at ges q exit rate on the lead approximately thomas gendron approximately yes gautam khanna okay i wanted to also just parse this igt aftermarket dynamic because you mentioned upgrades and aftermarket broadly i just can you trace what is actually in upgrade shipment versus a daytoday maintenance general service kind of sale thomas gendron we can gautam khanna you can and so which stepped down most thomas gendron the most – they are both they are all down most of the time with upgrades gautam khanna okay and thats volume thats not price but volume came down thomas gendron correct gautam khanna okay and – thomas gendron and we have to also  you are looking at that some of that is timing because we had a big first quarter a good first quarter and some of that first quarter could be an inventory that will be then going into the upgrade so if there is a timing issue that does occur and it could be totally timing and order thats what we are trying to highlight so the overall we go on a color code its down but there is some of that going on gautam khanna i dont remember you guys ever calling this out and so i am wondering is this the first quarter you have actually seen sizable step down sequentially on yearonyear in the upgrade market thomas gendron what we have is over the last couple of years we have had very strong upgrade market and so yes this might be the first down in the upgrade market that we had in the last couple of years so i think that’s why we highlighted it so the oe side its relatively flat and i comment earlier on the point in the cycle we are we do see that going forward increasing but we had couple of years very strong aftermarket here and i think first quarter we had down robert weber and we have called out that strength over the last two years gautam khanna absolutely thats why it’s surprising in terms of the typical order to revenue kind of conversion time line on one of these upgrades orders is it several months is it a month like i am just curious how quickly these things can turn where – whats the lead time whats the backlog if you will going into any quarter thomas gendron yes you mean our lead time within woodward is that question you are asking on the project gautam khanna yes exactly so like right your lead time to deliver the product you get an order how long does it take to deliver the product typically is it book and ship thomas gendron no these are much long i mean i got to think about the exact lead time from if we take the total lead time probably four months lead time and there maybe a little longer depending on how we have the production line waited so if you just go pure accumulate lead time its going to be much longer than that so we do a lot of forecasting planning to have the material on the pipeline so that we can respond quicker but thats you are talking pretty this isnt like book and ship really fast but it is longer cycle gautam khanna okay and how long would us say that the orders stock has been has it been through the first month of the current quarter as well like all of last quarter plus the first  thomas gendron we ended with the very strong first quarter of our fiscal year fourth quarter calendar year and the softening started to occur really beginning of january at the beginning of this year gautam khanna and just to be clear thats softness in orders because the sales were strong in the first quarter or  thomas gendron sales were good gautam khanna four monthly… thomas gendron sales were strong and orders declined in the as we move forward in the calendar year  gautam khanna but they were strong in fiscal q thomas gendron orders thats what you are asking on orders started  gautam khanna correct thomas gendron orders started softening in the first quarter and as you go through the quarter you can get orders dropping in or timing of project and things so we  the question we have seen some softening in the first quarter in orders yes because of lead time but as you go through quarters we are not sure exactly what you pick up in the next quarter so we saw some softening forecast we had some concern but we had a strong shipment first quarter but the orders didnt continue into our fiscal second quarter and thats what you are seeing so hopefully i clarify gautam khanna got it no that helps that helps to explain the bit of the margin okay thank you very much guys i appreciate for the answers operator okay thank you we will take our followup question from indiscernible capital your line is open unidentified analyst hey guys just a couple of model clarification questions on the tax rate the  sort of fullyear is that implies kind of the first half of around  or in upper s for back half of the year thomas gendron yes of course yes unidentified analyst okay and then the second one was just in regard to question earlier about kind of the nonsegment or corporate expenses i just want to make sure i understood kind of where that landed because this is up close to i think from throughout  is that very significant increase over last year on an adjusted basis at least thomas gendron yes so run rates in roughly that  sort of area and  but we will have some facility expenses and timing of some of those we have got some of our in nonsegment we have got some and all of our segments and so the timing is some of that will also determine in terms of move cost and something like that whether they are in the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of next year so that will move around a little bit it will a little bit higher than its been in the past years and then probably start to drop back down to where its been more historically unidentified analyst got it thanks very much thomas gendron sure welcome operator mr gendron there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference back to you thomas gendron okay i do appreciate everybody joining us today and i referred to it couple of times but hopefully everybody saw the press release advising them all of the analysts and
