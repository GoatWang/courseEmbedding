jonathan ebinger jonathan ebinger mba ’ is a general partner at bluerun ventures a leading earlystage venture capital firm that has helped finance and grow some of the biggest names in mobile such as paypal the ubiquitous ecommerce site waze one of the world’s largest communitybased traffic apps which is now owned by google and has gained international popularity and topsy a social search and analytics company recently purchased by applewhat do you look for when evaluating an investment opportunityit used to be three things strength of team strength of market and strength of technology but in the last couple of years i’ve added another attribute the company has to matter it’s just not worth it for me to spend time on another “me too” company i want to work with entrepreneurs who are looking to change the world it sounds cliché but if we are spending our time and resources we want it to be on something that’s going to make a differencehow would you define “making a difference” in

another big step up in innovationhow do you navigate opportunities in a market as broad as mobilewe focus on realtime data which measures realtime site traffic the advertising rotation and commerce so if we’ve pitched a product that doesn’t operate in real time it’s easy for us not to look at it innovation is important to our firm so we can stratify opportunities and hopefully point entrepreneurs toward investors that are right for their businessesalong with providing funding how do you help entrepreneurs grow their businessesa lot of times it’s really about growing the top line in my
