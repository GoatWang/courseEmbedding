sunday  april   edt last modified on sunday  april   edt sheryl sandberg’s last words to her husband like all last words assumed a haunting poignancy “i’m falling asleep” she told him oblivious to the imminence of tragedy and curled up on a cushion for a nap it was friday  may  she and dave goldberg  had left their two children at home with her parents in northern california and flown down to mexico for a weekend break to celebrate a friend’s th birthday they were silicon valley royalty’s power couple he the ceo of a tech company worth more than bn she the chief operating officer of facebook and author of global bestseller lean in a feminist call to arms for working women to emulate the selfbelief and ambition of men sandberg had featured on forbes’ list of the most powerful women on the planet served as chief of staff to the treasury secretary in bill clinton’s government been widely tipped as a future member of a hillary clinton cabinet and earned a personal fortune well in excess of bn at  she was mother to a yearold son and sevenyearold daughter weekends away were rare and precious no wonder she was tired she fell asleep that afternoon a happily married wife and woke up an hour later a widow when sandberg didn’t see her husband she at first thought nothing of it and joined her friends for a swim she took a shower spoke to their son on the phone and dressed for dinner it was only when she rejoined the group on the beach and realised no one had seen goldberg for hours that panic set in racing to the resort gym she found him lying on his back his face blue a pool of blood around his head she performed frantic cpr an ambulance rushed him to hospital but it was too late he had suffered a fatal heart attack sandberg flew home that evening to tell her children their father had died the news of sandberg’s loss made global headlines but held a particular resonance for my family i knew what it was to fly away a happy couple and come home with a coffin for our own beach holiday had shattered into tragedy  months earlier when my partner had drowned as a member of what sandberg calls “this club of ours no one ever wants to join” i wasn’t surprised that she went back to work  days later – when every room in your house is haunted by memories the longing for refuge is overwhelming nor was i surprised by the problem she was floored to find waiting for her at the office “you know we were facebook we were very open we sit at open desks and we share openly” she tells me as we talk at facebook hq in menlo park in northern california sandberg doesn’t even have her own office at work but sits among her colleagues in a vast openplan space “it’s part of who we are we share but everyone looked at me like i was a ghost no one would talk to me” she confided in her boss mark zuckerberg “all my relationships are gone and no one will talk to me” he told her “they want to they just don’t know what to say” in jewish tradition the mourning period for a spouse lasts for  days as it drew to a close sandberg took a risk so out of character that even now she seems faintly amazed by herself she wrote an unfiltered account of her griefstricken month and posted it publicly on facebook “the night before i thought this is a terrible idea this is too personal too raw there’s no way i’m posting this” but when she woke the next morning “i was like this is supposed to be the end of mourning i could not feel less like the end of mourning this is horrible and i said you know it’s not going to get worse and i just hit post and it broke open the dam” sandberg’s post has attracted more than  comments to date strangers all over the world flooded her facebook page with tales of their own tragedies and heartbreaks “and you know” she says “after that i didn’t feel alone any more” facebook twitter pinterest with husband dave goldberg in  four years before his sudden death photograph julie jacobsonap if something as simple as sharing stories could have such a radical impact on her grief sandberg wondered what else might why is it that some people never recover from loss while others emerge with greater resilience to lead more meaningful lives working with a psychologist adam grant sandberg studied the research of behavioural scientists neurologists and psychologists for techniques empirically proven to build resilience to her amazement she discovered that by applying them all she wouldn’t just recover but could actually achieve “posttraumatic growth” option b sandberg and grant’s book is part personal memoir and part practical manual for how to withstand catastrophe and grow from adversity she even claims it can deliver “pretraumatic growth” for readers yet to suffer loss themselves who fortify themselves with the lessons she has learned had i not yet read the book this might sound to me like the laughable nonsense of california selfhelp but option b named after the idea that if your option a is taken away you have to “kick the shit out of option b” is the single wisest book about grief i have ever found and so useful that i only wish it had been in print three years ago when i was widowed i would have stuck pages to my fridge and sent it to relatives who wanted to help but didn’t know how so cleared off rather than get it wrong all we’d needed was a book spelling out how to help when i was too broken to explain i have tried to think of anyone who would not find option b invaluable at some point in their life and i can’t  facebook hq lies  miles south of san francisco on a forgettable stretch of industrial estate flanked by a freeway whoever designed it went to some lengths to perfect an aggressively glamourfree aesthetic the grey metal building is a quarter of a mile long stands on top of a nineacre car park and is accessed by squat silver buildings which look uncannily like the entrance lobbies found in ikea car parks the resemblance to ikea does not end there each lobby is furnished by a reception that appears to have been knocked together in a hurry out of makeshift plywood but on closer inspection turns out to be permanent stairs lead up to the first floor where openplan office space stretches as far as the eye can see and accommodates  staff the interior looks halffinished – concrete floors no ceiling to conceal the industrial tangle of electrical cables and ventilation flues overhead – but facebook moved in two years ago so this must be how it’s meant to look rows of identical white desks are punctuated by columns identified by numbers like an ikea warehouse presumably to help staff find their way back facebook calls its hq a campus and it’s easy to see why as i don’t spot anyone over  and everybody is dressed like an undergraduate sandberg’s desk is somewhere near the middle and looks like everyone else’s we will meet in a big glass box one of two meeting rooms and the only enclosed spaces i see i was not shocked by the anger not shocked by the sadness but the selfconfidence blow completely surprised me but no amount of gratuitous architectural austerity can distract from the power and wealth of this organisation for most of which its coo is almost singlehandedly responsible sandberg joined from google in  and turned facebook from a popular tech startup that didn’t make money into one of the wealthiest companies on the planet she comes to meet me straight after the photoshoot looking like an italian screen siren all tiny birdlike limbs and big luxurious hair and is shockingly beautiful to my surprise she throws her arms around me and showers me in flattery “i’m so glad you’re doing this interview” she tells me fixing a luminescent gaze “because you get it” in the early months after goldberg’s death sandberg says she made the three classic mistakes – “the three ps – personalisation pervasiveness and permanence” she blamed herself for his death “especially because the early reports which were false said he died by falling off an exercise machine so i absolutely thought that if i had looked for him sooner he would be alive a friend would say to me ‘you didn’t leave a threeyearold alone in a gym’ but i felt hugely guilty” when the autopsy revealed undiagnosed coronary artery disease “i spent months thinking i should have known that i felt hugely guilty you blame yourself endlessly then one day adam grant said ‘if you do not recover your kids cannot recover that is it you must’ so that really snapped me out of it i was like ok this isn’t my fault i stopped taking it personally “then the pervasiveness you don’t want to feel that anything’s good as in ‘can i feel ok about work how can i feel ok’ right and then the permanence and that for me was the hardest it felt in the depths of grief that i would always feel sad it would always feel that bad and the sadness is still here i still miss him every day but it does not feel like it did in the beginning when you can’t breathe that’s why i shared so openly about the pain and the grief because i think the only way people are going to think it gets better is if they know you feel what they were feeling” sandberg writes about the moment she had to break the news to her children of their father’s death “the screaming and crying that followed haunt me to this day nothing has come close to the pain of this moment even now when my mind wanders back i shake and my throat constricts” she studied research on how to raise resilient children asked friends to make videos of themselves talking about their memories of goldberg filmed the children sharing their own memories of their father and played one of those films back to her daughter when she worried she was “forgetting daddy because she has not seen him for so long” on what would have been his th birthday they wrote letters to him and sent them up in balloons she learned actively to seek out and treasure small moments of joy and made it a habit to write down a list of three moments at the end of every day “writing about joyful experiences for just three days can improve people’s moods and decrease their visits to health centres a full three months later” she reports in option b – and having taken her advice and tried it i can confirm it works i almost winced with selfconsciousness making my first entry – “dancing with my son in a children’s nightclub” – but it makes me smile every time i read it another device she learned works too to make a list each night of three things she’d done well that day in the early days hers were as modest as made tea got through all of my emails went to work and focused for most of one meeting “but it really does work” she says “and everyone i know who’s tried it since then has told me it works it absolutely works” facebook twitter pinterest with mark zuckerberg photograph andrew gombertepa she could never have guessed that rebuilding selfconfidence would play such a big part in recovering from grief “well that part was so interesting for me right because i’d thought a lot about selfconfidence i wrote an entire book on selfconfidence the lean in community helps people get together to build selfconfidence now i had read about grief and i was not shocked by the anger not shocked by the sadness but the selfconfidence blow completely surprised me” confidence was not a commodity sandberg had ever been short of before now she felt like a failure both at work and at home “i felt i could barely get through a meeting without thinking about dave and parenting is hard in the first place but i had a partner and i had two kids with very happy childhoods then all of a sudden i had two grieving children and no partner and no experience so my selfconfidence completely crumbled” what sandberg needed for the first time in her life was praise when she made mistakes in the early weeks back at work her colleagues would brush them off with “how could you keep things straight with all you’re going through” it was exactly what she had said herself in the past to anyone struggling with personal problems now she saw that far from making her feel better it only damaged her selfconfidence further she found out what actually helped when she panicked to zuckerberg about something she’d got wrong and he responded “really i thought you made a good point in that meeting and helped us make a better decision” empathy she writes “was nice but encouragement was better” another mistake she’d made before goldberg died was to ask people in trouble “is there anything i can do” she says “i really meant it but it kind of shifts the burden to the person who needs the help to tell you” the classic inquiry “how are you” also turned out to be unhelpful “well my husband just died on the floor of a gym like how am i” the more meaningful question she learned is “how are you today” mark is why i’m walking when i felt so isolated and just needed to cry i would drag him into his conference room but the biggest – and remarkably common – mistake is to ask nothing at all “i want to talk about dave bringing up dave to me is always a positive it doesn’t make me sad i know he’s gone” i ask if anyone has said they didn’t like to mention him as they didn’t want to “remind” her of her loss and she laughs “yes it’s not possible to remind me” she recommends something she calls the platinum rule of friendship “not to treat people as you want to be treated but treat people as they want to be treated that’s a pretty big mind shift and some people do that quite naturally and some people don’t” to anyone who saw the social network the film about facebook’s origins which portrayed zuckerberg as a socially awkward computer geek this may come as a surprise but the emotionally astute standout star of option b is sandberg’s boss “mark is why i’m walking most of what he and his wife priscilla did is not even in the book because they did so much when i felt so overwhelmed and so isolated and just needed to cry i would drag him into his conference room and he would just sit there with me and be like ‘we’re going to get through this and we want to get through it with you’ he did it over and over” facebook twitter pinterest with mike pence and donald trump in december last year photograph drew angerergetty images sandberg says she likes the person loss has taught her to become and prefers this new self to her old one “i would definitely choose to be before so i could get dave back i’d give up all the growth but the deeper sense of meaning gratitude purpose – those things are wonderful things my kids have unbelievable perspective my son they lost the basketball playoffs two weeks ago and all the other kids are pretty upset and my son looks at me and goes ‘mum we’ve been through horrible things this is sixth grade basketball i’m good’ he just had a birthday party because he’s going to turn  and the joy i feel in that i never felt before before i thought it was obvious he would turn  who doesn’t turn  but now i do not take that for granted and that does with all the pain give your life much deeper meaning” i get the impression though that she is angrier than she cares to say she writes about having struggled with anger and when i ask how she managed her feelings towards loved ones she felt let her down i’m struck by how she sidesteps the question “i don’t know anyone who’s been through this who hasn’t had friends who disappointed them i think we all go through that” has she lost friends she looks uneasy “there are people who i was close to and am now not as close to very few but there’s a few” ten months after being widowed sandberg began dating bobby kotick an old friend and tech billionaire a facebook user posted that she was a “garbage whore” another that she was “one classy lady” for “already sharing fluids with a new guy” i ask how she feels about being judged and glimpse a rare flash of uncamouflaged anger “i’m hoping that this book helps people stop judging people who date after the loss of a partner particularly women because women get judged much more harshly men date sooner men date more and women get judged more and you know obviously that’s super unfair i think i’m helping people remember that dating for those who want to do it is part of moving forward and it is option b if i could i would only date dave i made that choice i just had that taken away from me” i ask if her children have accepted her new partner and she says “yes yes” but something in her expression closes the subject down facebook twitter pinterest with old friend and new boyfriend bobby kotick last july photograph getty images sandberg was not born into the executive superrich she grew up in miami comfortably middle class the eldest of three children to an ophthalmologist father and a mother who taught french a straight a student she studied economics at harvard before being hired by her thesis tutor larry summers to be his assistant at the world bank she returned to harvard a year later studied an mba graduated with distinction and was hired by the management consultants mckinsey before going to work for summers in the white house her sole biographical failure as she saw it was a marriage at  to a washington businessman which ended in divorce a year later she is without a doubt one of the most impressive women i’ve ever met and yet there is something disconcerting about our conversation a sense that we are impersonating intimacy beneath the surface something feels tightly controlled strategically calculated as our hour together comes to a close i sense her attention starting to wander the early intensity has gone the luminescence is fading she glances at the clock i try to ask about facebook but she stops me we are to talk about the book nothing else and the shutters slam down a few minutes later we hug goodbye but before i leave i’m taken aback when she asks “so what did i get wrong” what does she mean “the book tell me what i got wrong” i remember that sandberg is famous for inviting feedback so i tell her i wish she’d put more of herself into the book she looks appalled “no really” her editors she groans already extracted more from her than she meant to divulge there is nothing left she says to tell but listening back to the interview tape afterwards i’m struck by the deftness with which she evades inquiries that trespass from the path of the story she wants to tell for example she takes conspicuous care throughout option b to acknowledge the wealth that protects her from difficulties most widows face i ask if she did this because critics of lean in accused her of appearing oblivious to the privileges that make her life unrecognisable to most women but before i can finish the question she replies with statistics about single mothers’ poverty levels when i ask if she’s concerned that the resentful register of contemporary identity politics will make it hard for some readers to find sympathy for a billionaire widow she closes the question down with “i think everyone deserves sympathy” and starts talking about a prison visit she made and how prisoners deserve it too which is a different question altogether and one she is far too clever to have confused with mine i leave in awe of sandberg’s resolve to find a positive story to tell out of tragedy but i also leave feeling unsettled by how carefully curated the whole encounter seemed it takes days to place the feeling and when i do it is perfectly obvious it’s exactly the feeling i get when i look at profiles on facebook perhaps that’s no surprise sandberg is a natural leader and problem solver – not merely facebook’s coo but its living embodiment – who has dealt with her grief almost as if it were a failing business to be turned around she studied the data applied herself to its findings and found the potential for growth ‘he led me to the dancefloor and we let go dancing and singing then i burst into tears’ an exclusive extract from sheryl sandberg’s new book facebook twitter pinterest sandberg far right with ‘the girls’ ‘friends for life’ since school when i was  my best friend informed me that i wasn’t cool enough to hang out with this hurtful breakup turned out to be a blessing soon after i was dumped three girls picked me up we became friends for life adding three more to our circle in high school mindy eve jami elise pam and beth – or as we still call each other “the girls” in the fall of  beth’s daughter was becoming a batmitzvah part of me didn’t want to go just days before my husband dave died we had picked a date for our son’s barmitzvah the thought that dave would not be at our own son’s ceremonial transition to adulthood cast a pall over the occasion but during the dark days of that summer the girls had checked in daily they took turns coming to california by showing up again and again they proved to me that i was not alone i wanted to be there for them in the happy times just as they’d been there for me in the sad sitting with the girls and their families at the service felt deeply comforting almost as if i had been transported back to when we were teenagers the ceremony ended with the traditional reciting of the prayer for those who have died six hands reached out to me my friends held me tightly and we got through it together at the party that night there were other guests from our miami schooldays including the cutest boy in our class brook rose back then none of us believed we had a chance with him and after college he confirmed that when he told us he’s gay the dj started playing september by earth wind  fire and brook reached for my hand he led me to the dancefloor and just like high school we let go dancing and singing then i burst into tears brook quickly manoeuvred me to the outdoor patio and asked what was wrong i assumed i was missing dave except i knew exactly what that felt like and somehow this was different then it dawned on me dancing to a song from childhood had taken me to a place where i wasn’t filled with loneliness and longing i actually felt happy and that happiness was followed immediately by a flood of guilt how could i be happy when dave was gone facebook twitter pinterest sandberg with glasses with ‘the girls’ the next day i told my friend adam grant a psychologist about my meltdown on the dancefloor he wasn’t surprised “of course this was the first moment you were happy” he told me “you haven’t been doing a single thing that brings you joy” for more than four months since dave died i’d been completely focused on my kids my job and just making it through each day i had stopped doing anything dave and i had done together for fun such as going to movies having dinner with friends watching game of thrones or playing settlers of catan or scrabble catan was especially upsetting to me because dave and i had been playing during our last moments while on holiday in mexico to celebrate a friend’s birthday there were plenty of reasons to hole up i didn’t want to leave my kids with a babysitter i was afraid that if i tried to go out i’d end up crying in public i had made one attempt to be social early that autumn i invited friends over to watch a movie we started the evening with frozen yoghurt and i kept thinking you can do this pretend everything’s normal a few minutes into the movie the main character’s wife died i thought the froyo was going to come back up everything was not normal in my facebook post  days into widowhood i wrote that i’d never have another moment of pure joy when friends who had lost spouses assured me that some day i would feel happy again i didn’t believe them then earth wind  fire proved me wrong but the moment of happiness was fleeting barely rearing its head before guilt whacked it back into its hole survivor guilt is a thief of joy when people lose a loved one they are not just racked with grief but also with remorse “i could have saved her” “why am i the one who is still alive” even after acute grief is gone the guilt remains “i didn’t spend enough time with him” until that moment on the dancefloor i did not realise i’d been holding myself back from happiness even that fleeting moment was ruined by guilt making my prediction that i’d never feel pure joy again seem accurate then one day dave’s brother rob gave me a true gift “since the day dave met you all he ever wanted was to make you happy” rob told me his voice choking up “he would want you to be happy – even now don’t take that away from him” my sisterinlaw amy helped too by making me see how much my mood affected my children they had told her they were feeling better because “mommy stopped crying all the time” with rob’s and amy’s words ringing in my ears i decided to try having fun for my children – and with my children dave had loved playing catan with our kids one afternoon i asked them if they wanted to play they did in the past i was always orange my daughter was blue my son was red dave was grey when just the three of us sat down to play my daughter pulled out the grey pieces my son got upset and tried to take them away from her insisting “that was daddy’s colour you can’t be grey” i held his hand and said “she can be grey we take things back” “we take it back” became our mantra – rather than give up the things that reminded us of dave we embraced them we took back rooting for the teams that dave loved we took back poker which dave had played with our kids since they were young for myself i took back game of thrones it wasn’t nearly as much fun as watching with dave who had read the entire series of books and could track who was plotting against whom but i caught up and ended the season rooting for khaleesi and her dragons i started having friends over to watch movies looking more carefully for ones in which no one loses a spouse my best takeback was finding the perfect online scrabble opponent dave and i had played together dave and rob had played together now rob and i play each other in almost  games i have beaten rob a grand total of once but now for just a few minutes on our phones throughout the day rob and i are connected to each other… and to dave whether you see joy as a discipline an act of defiance a luxury or a necessity it is something everyone deserves even when we’re in great distress joy can still be found cooking dancing hiking praying driving singing billy joel songs offkey and when these moments add up we find that they give us more than happiness they also give us strength • this is an edited and condensed extract from option b facing adversity building resilience and finding joy by sheryl sandberg and adam grant published on  april by wh allen at £ to

business emma mcintyre  stringer  getty images as chief operating officer of facebook sheryl sandberg knows a thing or two about sustaining a successful business like many other leading luminaries of the tech industry shes a voracious reader who credits the habit with helping her achieve such stratospheric heights the lean startup by eric ries is a favorite she recommends to all entrepreneurs written to help new ventures develop sustainable business models quickly this book advocates taking a scientific approach to building a business by continuously refining products based on feedback if youre interested in ensuring your startups success these seven insights from the lean startup can keep your business on the right track  focus the entire startup on a single goal as a startup your primary goal is to find a profitable and sustainable business model the faster you do that the more likely youll be to succeed start by focusing the entire company on finding out which products your potential customers want only after youve figured this out should you try to translate customers desire into dollars  use validated learning to find and test your business model your best bet for effectively selling the right product to the right people is by using a scientific approach known as validated learning begin by hypothesizing whether and how a certain product will be successful then find out if people will actually buy it by offering it to them and observing their reactions amazon  develop a minimal viable product to test your idea in the market in order to quickly find out whether demand for your idea truly exists create a minimal viable product mvp to collect meaningful feedback this barebones version of your concept should only contain the essential components but should be substantial enough to give potential customers a realistic product experience  build measure learn as fast as possible after creating a prototype of your product establish a buildmeasurelearn bml loop to continuously improve upon it gather authentic feedback on your prototype and based on what you learn conceptualize and construct an improved version rinse and repeat as rapidly as possible to find your optimal business model more quickly  use splittesting to optimize your idea to help you determine which of your products features customers find valuable — and which they dont — create two versions of your concept one with a new feature and one without it this type of splittesting makes it easy to see which version customers prefer helping you decide which features to keep — and which to ditch  be prepared to pivot if your initial hypothesis isnt playing out as planned it might be time for a pivot this fundamental change of course might mean redefining your core values targeting a different customer segment or choosing a new sales channel making the decision to pivot isnt easy but many successful startups have done so and it shouldnt be avoided  concentrate on your current customers while it might be tempting for startups to pursue new customers at all costs a safer strategy is to get current customers to use your product increasingly often by regularly offering new features or providing new services your current advocates will become more vocal making it more likely your product will go viral more from blinkist see also facebook coo

reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story palo alto califevery monday a bit before  am sheryl sandberg facebook’s chief operating officer dashes off a quick email to her boss mark zuckerberg “we have a routine” ms sandberg says “i email ‘coming in’ he replies ‘on my way’ ”a few minutes later mr zuckerberg facebook’s cofounder and chief executive walks into the company’s headquarters here says a few hellos and heads to a conference room where he and ms sandberg huddle for an hour the two executives end the week the same way with a closeddoor meeting on friday afternoon they discuss products strategy deals personnel — and each other“we agreed that we would give each other feedback every friday” ms sandberg says “we are constantly flagging things nothing ever builds up” at a recent meeting for instance they ironed out a disagreement between them over the details of mr zuckerberg’s pledge to give  million to schools in newarkif all of that sounds a bit touchyfeely well it is ms sandberg a wellregarded internet executive is known for her interpersonal skills as much as for her sharp intellect and her regular meetings with the famously introverted mr zuckerberg have helped to keep one of silicon valley’s most unusual business partnerships working wonders for facebook advertisement continue reading the main story indeed for a variety of reasons ms sandberg may well have become mr zuckerberg’s most valuable friend continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story since ms sandberg joined the company more than two years ago facebook has successfully navigated one of the more perilous stages in a startup’s life a period of hypergrowth facebook’s work force has expanded sixfold to nearly  and its global audience has multiplied by more than seven to half a billion revenue once little more than an afterthought is expected to balloon to around  billion this year according to estimates from wedbush securities facebook a private company doesn’t disclose its revenuepart of the reason for that sales growth is ms sandberg’s close ties to many of the world’s largest advertisers relationships she first developed as a senior executive at google ms sandberg also brought stability to facebook which had suffered from a long period of turmoil and the departure of several executives and early employees including the company’s other cofounders“one of the reasons the company is doing so well is because the two of them get along so well” says mike schroepfer vice president for engineeringms sandberg has focused on building the business expanding internationally cultivating relationships with large advertisers and putting her polish on things like communications and public policy that has freed mr zuckerberg to focus on what he likes best the facebook web site and its platformdonald graham the chairman of the washington post company who once tried to hire ms sandberg says that in the last two years a lot of questions about facebook’s viability have been put to rest“the combination of mark and sheryl is the primary reason” says mr graham who is also a member of facebook’s boardthese days ms sandberg is also juggling another duty mounting a defense of mr zuckerberg at a time when a new movie “the social network” portrays him as an aloof and conniving student who may have stolen the idea for facebook from others ms sandberg will have none of that advertisement continue reading the main story “he is shy and introverted and he often does not seem very warm to people who don’t know him but he is warm” ms sandberg says of mr zuckerberg her voice rising with empathy “he really cares about the people who work here”she can be just as protective of mr zuckerberg in privateat a technology conference this summer for instance mr zuckerberg flopped during an onstage interview he gave rambling answers to questions about facebook’s privacy policies became visibly nervous and started sweating profusely after the interview ms sandberg encouraged him not to beat himself up over it but to focus on parts of the interview that went well so he could do better next time according to people briefed on their interaction who didn’t want to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter photo sheryl sandberg is credited with helping to guide the growth of facebook — and her boss credit todd heislerthe new york times “she really wants him to succeed” says one of these peoplefor all her achievements there’s one area where ms sandberg’s influence has yet to work its magic privacy concerns while ms sandberg is not ultimately responsible for the features on the facebook site — that’s mr zuckerberg’s job — she is deeply involved in the planning that revolves around them she readily acknowledges that facebook has made mistakes“it is completely fair to say that we have had our challenges around privacy” she saysms sandberg says that facebook built powerful privacy controls but that they became too complicated for the average user facebook recently simplified those settings “mark took the step to apologize” about the privacy problems she notesbut some critics say the privacy issue goes beyond how easily users understand facebook’s settings for example they note facebook collects increasing amounts of personal information from users to help marketers finetune their messages“i fear that ms sandberg is failing to provide the adult supervision that facebook requires” says jeff chester executive director of the center for digital democracy an advocacy group based in washington “facebook’s direction regarding its use of its member data and the viral and largely stealth marketing practices it endorses is very disturbing”a spokesman for facebook said the site lets users control what information they want to share and with whom and makes it clear how the information may be used in its advertising products facebook never sells that information to third parties the spokesman saidmark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg may well be silicon valley’s oddest couplemr zuckerberg a yearold engineer and product visionary is socially awkward and reserved at  ms sandberg is the opposite polished personable chatty and at ease in the limelight advertisement continue reading the main story the differences don’t end there mr zuckerberg dropped out of harvard after his sophomore year to focus on building facebook and has never worked anywhere else ms sandberg who has a harvard mba is a veteran of google where she had a central role in building the largest most successful advertising business on the internetby the time she left google her unit had grown from a handful of people to about  employees or about onequarter of google’s total and it accounted for more than half of the company’s revenue she also helped to establish google’s philanthropic arm and ran operations for a collection of unrelated projects like google’s bookscanning operationseric schmidt google’s chief executive says he considers ms sandberg to be a “superstar” but there is growing tension between the two companies in part because ms sandberg has recruited a string of former google executives and employees about  exgooglers are now working at facebook newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify

world bank and at mckinsey  company and then worked as chief of staff for lawrence h summers when he was treasury secretary in the clinton administrationdespite their obvious differences — or maybe because of them — mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg have grown close “a lot of people choose to hire people who look exactly like them” mr zuckerberg says “here we just value balance a lot more it takes work to build those relationships but if it does work you end up with a much better system”mr zuckerberg met ms sandberg at a christmas party in  and they immediately took a liking to each other what followed was an intense sixweek business courtship during which the two dined together multiple times a week because both of them are silicon valley celebrities they typically ate at ms sandberg’s house so they could keep their talks confidential“we were very methodical and thoughtful about the relationship” says ms sandbergfor his part mr zuckerberg ever the tech geek describes their interactions as “highbandwidth”“we can talk for  seconds and have more meaning be exchanged than in a lot of meetings that i have for an hour” he says ms sandberg might give him a quick update on say the development of facebook’s offices in ireland or india“i make sure that i understand the basic things that we are doing” says mr zuckerberg but he adds he trusts that anything ms sandberg handles will run smoothly “the dynamic on the management team” he says “has improved a huge amount since she joined” photo sheryl sandberg second from left and mark zuckerberg right in sun valley idaho in july they met with george bodenheimer left of espn and abc sports and robert a iger of disney credit mario anzuonireuters outside the company ms sandberg spends much of her time with advertisers last week for example she crisscrossed manhattan where she gave a keynote speech at an advertising week conference and met in private with various large advertisers advertisement continue reading the main story ms sandberg also oversees the seemingly arcane operational details that can help a company run smoothly — especially a company that is growing rapidlyshe recently sat down with pedram keyani an engineer whose team builds the tools that handle complaints and requests from facebook’s users mr keyani said ms sandberg met with his small group to understand the challenges it faced and later reorganized it to run more smoothly“she operates at every level” mr keyani says “she’s good at strategy and dives deep and understands how teams work together”the embrace of ms sandberg by mr zuckerberg and facebook’s something rankandfile was not preordained when she was hired a frathouse atmosphere permeated the company according to many early employees and technology blogs speculated that she had been brought in to clean up the placeto this day ms sandberg looks a bit out of place at facebook she sits in a cluster of desks that includes mr zuckerberg’s as well as those of other engineering and product executives their penchant for jeans tshirts and hoodies is in sharp contrast to her taste for elegant clothing her own staff which handles most of facebook’s business functions works in another building a few blocks awayher efforts to win over the facebook troops began on her first day she went desk to desk to introduce herself cracking jokes and asking questions it had the desired effect“she’s legit” says christopher cox a confidant of mr zuckerberg and the company’s vice president for product “she’s not like a robot mba the people who get rejected here are the people who come here and say all these mba words like ‘synergy’ ” advertisement continue reading the main story ms sandberg earned a reputation for mentoring many younger employees — especially women encouraging many of them not to shy away from important roles simply because they were planning to start families ms sandberg can speak to that topic from experience she is married to dave goldberg the chief executive of surveymonkey a maker of software for online surveys and the couple have two young childrenwhenever anyone on her side of the company is promoted she sends a congratulatory notepeople who have known ms sandberg a long time say they are not surprised by her success as a harvard undergraduate she sat near the back of an economics class taught by mr summers he says he didn’t pay much attention to her until she turned in the best midterm examination in her class — and then the best finalmr summers became her thesis adviser and later hired her to work with him at the world bank and at the treasury department although she was still in her s she played pivotal roles like helping ramp up aid efforts to africa by opening treasury’s door to bono of u“i had never heard of him and said to sheryl that i only meet with people who have a first name and last name” mr summers recalls at ms sandberg’s urging he finally agreed debt relief in africa “wouldn’t have happened if she hadn’t insisted i meet bono and persevered on this issue” says mr summersms sandberg’s connection with mr zuckerberg runs especially deep the two often socialize and mr zuckerberg who was captain of his high school fencing team has taught ms sandberg’s yearold son a few fencing moveswhen mr zuckerberg and priscilla chan his longtime girlfriend started thinking about philanthropy they turned to ms sandberg she immediately tapped her vast network of contacts and organized meetings with the likes of mayor michael r bloomberg of new york and michelle a rhee the schools chief in washington dcms sandberg “helped me navigate the politics of it and to figure out where i could have the most leverage” mr zuckerberg says “that she was the person that priscilla and i turned to is a strong symbol of our relationship” continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think related coverage the media equation film version of zuckerberg

sharing manifesto drives facebook  bloomberg how sheryl sandberg’s sharing manifesto drives facebook the coo inspires her fans and her employees to talk about sadness even tragedy at work that can be healing—and very good for business photographer mark peterson for bloomberg businessweek by sarah frier sarahfrier more stories by sarah frier april    am edt on the last day in january about two dozen prolific users of facebook were invited to the social network’s headquarters in menlo park calif there they were arranged in a circle of brightly colored chairs to meet sheryl sandberg the company’s secondhighestranking executive and the oprah of corporate america the guests who had made lifechanging friendships using an organizational tool called facebook groups were invited to ask sandberg questions she insisted that she had to hear their stories firstthat’s when the tears started flowing a woman talked about how a facebook post on her struggle to become a mother led her to adopt a foster child two women from opposite coasts discussed how they’d become close by starting a private group to help women of color navigate mental health issues and a dallas waiter who’d lost his leg because of a rare bone disease talked about meeting a man who’d helped him raise money to try out for a soccer team for the disabled sandberg dressed in a loose white sweater jeans and boots california quietluxury style leaned in over and over to listen offering words of encouragement and hugs “i love this” she told them after the sudden death of her husband david goldberg two years ago she was comforted to know that facebook was helping others cope with their own hardshipsas they talked cameras and boom mics followed members of the press looked on from the edge of the room the publicized event was in celebration of friends day a facebookconceived holiday with all the authenticity of greeting card company concoctions like “grandparents day” but really it was just another normal morning at facebook inc where employees are generally encouraged to share their personal challenges with colleagues nor would the event have been out of place in the emotionally welladjusted atmosphere that now characterizes many corporate cultures thanks in large part to sandberg herself on friends day mark zuckerberg facebook’s ceo also enthusiastically joined the festivities but when guests were asked for the highlight of the trip—dinner out in palo alto or the session where they got to give product advice—one woman quickly answered “getting a selfie with sheryl”sandberg’s message of openness and empathy may come across as a selfserving schtick facebook’s coo encouraging people to overshare is like exxon mobil promoting oil but since she’s one of the most powerful women in business you can’t just dismiss her as the chief emoting officer there’s what sandberg’s accomplished at zuckerberg’s side—the company is with a market value of  billion the world’s fifthlargest and affects the daily lives of its almost  billion users there’s also her hardertoquantify role as this decade’s leading culture shifter in the long slog toward a corporate reality in which winning doesn’t require posing as a mandecades ago pioneering feminists like betty friedan and gloria steinem pointed out that compartmentalizing domestic and professional spheres was a way for men to stay in charge because women can’t hide the fact that they’re pregnant or breastfeeding simply being female looked unprofessional and as long as problems related to child care and other forms of domestic labor—traditionally the purview of women—weren’t seen as work public policies would never change and women would never become part of political decisionmakingthe foremothers of today’s female ceos organized women to become a vocal force asserting that their issues were collective ones but over the years the pace of change slowed sandberg in her blockbuster bestseller lean in women work and the will to lead cowritten by nell scovell and through her nonprofit leaninorg picked up the thread encouraging women to get together online and in person to share the struggles and feelings involved in bridging those stillpresent divides sandberg’s central management message was a compelling one “bring your whole self into work” she’d conveyed this inspirational koan in a commencement address to harvard business school her alma mater in  the year before the book was published the slightly paradoxical idea was for women to drop their professional facades and convey vulnerability to better connect with colleagues and customers while at the same time acting with the confidence needed to rise in the workplacenow with the publication of a new instructional memoir option b facing adversity building resilience and finding joy sandberg has taken that cause even further moving workday anguish over setbacks such as divorce disease and death from solo crying jags in the office parking lot to company hallways conference rooms and boardrooms after sandberg became a widow and the single mother of a gradeschoolage son and daughter she was vulnerable in a way she couldn’t control “if i believed before dave died in bringing your whole self to work what i learned after option b is you have no choice” she says during an interview at facebook “when your whole self is going through adversity and tragedy that whole self comes to work”in the book cowritten with wharton school professor and ted talk superstar adam grant she weaves her family’s story of loss with academic data on recovery from tragedy and with anecdotes from others facing cancer disability or mental illness the title refers to a conversation sandberg had with her friend phil deutch a managing partner at an energy fund as she recounts in the first chapter called “breathing again” he offered to fill in for goldberg at a fatherchild school activity “but i want dave” sandberg writes deutch put his arm around her and said “option a is not available so let’s kick the shit out of option b” back at work motivational posters encouraging people to “kick the shit out of option b” went up all over the sprawling campustwo friends gave sandberg chains on which to string her husband’s wedding ring she melded them and wears the necklace dailyphotographer mark peterson for bloomberg businessweeksandberg doesn’t have an office in the den of transparency that is facebook but she does have a personal conference room a glasswalled case with a table right in the middle of all the standing desks and modernist furniture on a recent tuesday between meetings she uses a spare moment as many workers do checking for comments on her most recent facebook post an announcement of the upcoming book unlike most people she has thousands to wade throughone comment jumps out at her from a woman who says her husband died a week after goldberg passed away “she went back to work after  days because i did” sandberg says folding her hands over her chest while seated in her conference room “i would never want anyone to lose their husband at  ever but given that it happened isn’t it incredible that i feel connected to her after the post this morning i feel less alone”sandberg exudes such intense sincerity when she talks that it can come across as manufactured her eyes fix on listeners as she takes them through data a vignette and a handy concluding sentence—exactly the package they need to convey it to someone else her tone is one you’d use talking to a close girlfriend though her sentences end with her voice falling which underscores the seriousness of what she’s saying her conversations incorporate calculated pauses that provide opportunities to absorb her message she’s disciplined too even when she’s telling recycled stories and jokes friends and colleagues who’ve heard them before marvel that she can deliver them with fresh emotion and impactsandberg contends that she’s almost an accidental prophet of openness in the workplace a decade ago as an executive at google inc she always worked from  am to  pm then her first child was born and she found she couldn’t stand coming home to find him already asleep she started sneaking out of the office early sometimes placing a decoy jacket on her chair leaving the light on at her desk or scheduling afternoon meetings in other buildings so her colleagues wouldn’t see her leave the subterfuge continued for years then in  about a month before facebook’s initial public offering she admitted to a reporter that she regularly left work at  the revelation blared across multiple news outlets sandberg was worried that she would be lectured or fired instead her brazenness was heralded by other female professionals the women of the legal team at yahoo inc sent her flowers with a card saying that they too were leaving at  “i didn’t realize how much noise there would be” sandberg says “a friend told me ‘you couldn’t have gotten more publicity if you murdered someone with an ax’ ” this was in the innocent days before facebook live the streaming video service was used by murderers for prwhen she submitted the lean in manuscript to editors later that year they told her that the first draft was boring it was all data and research with nothing about her own challenges navigating the workplace obstacle course of gender expectations and entrenched sexism goldberg told her nobody would read it if she didn’t put herself into it she began rewriting sandberg says she didn’t want to overshare but apparently the market was demanding itwhen goldberg died she regretted the fame the book had brought her “if i could have gone back and rewritten lean in i would have because i didn’t want to live publicly” she says “but then it was so isolating” people avoided her gaze interactions became stilted she confided to zuckerberg that she felt as though her workplace friendships were melting away one night before bed she wrote a word explanation of what she was going through and how she hoped people would interact with her it started as a cathartic exercise she didn’t think she would publish it but when she woke up she changed her mind and put it on facebook in lean in sandberg had admitted to crying at work another confession the media jumped on but this was the first time she’d shared anything so deeply personal the post received  comments many from coworkers acknowledging her struggleof course one could argue that sandberg had begun down this path the moment she joined facebook—a company that earns billions from getting people to open up about their lives she and zuckerberg have frequently been asked to lead by example when facebook lifted a tactic from twitter and gave public figures the option of opening their profiles to people who weren’t friends but followers “i wasn’t going to do it and neither was mark” sandberg says then a communications executive caryn marooney told them they would have to do it if they wanted others to fall in line “i think the product has really changed us” sandberg says earnestly zuckerberg gives her a lot of credit too “when sheryl first came to facebook she started a tradition of checkingin to our leadership meetings” he wrote in an email “checkingin” means each person around the table is invited to discuss their current emotional and professional state before they get down to business “nine years later we’re still doing it”in  sandberg hosted an allhands meeting to talk about the connection between sharing personal stories and working at a place like facebook she talked at length about the company’s culture and how employees were individually charged with serving its mission “to make the world more open and connected” then she introduced some employees whom she now describes as “a bunch of people who went onstage and shared a lot of really personal stuff things they’d gone through and how facebook connected to it”one employee who got the message was stephanie latham a marketing director who coordinates facebook’s relationship with the auto industry and had just relocated to menlo park when she found out she had cancer and was pregnant reluctant to post about her personal life she told only her team so they could prepare for her unpredictable schedule soon after a group of her coworkers including some she didn’t know produced a video for her set to pharrell williams’s happy latham was moved to tearsnews of the video reached sandberg who encouraged latham to share her story at facebook’s internal women’s leadership day conference “that was way out of my comfort zone but i felt like it was a necessary thing to do” latham says in an interviewthe episode sounds like a scene from the circle the bestselling thriller by dave eggers that’s just been released as a feature film starring emma watson in it employees at a facebooklike company are svengalied into making their lives and emotions transparent as a precursor to totalitarian thought control but in real life latham’s story didn’t end in treachery and murder it just went viral on the company’s internal network responses from colleagues were accompanied by the hashtag fbfamily which was later printed on blue rubber wristbands and passed around campus latham now cancerfree with a healthy daughter credits sandberg for helping her find a supportive community at work “she leads so strongly by example” latham saysample sharing among colleagues is inculcated in employees from the second they walk in the door new hires are invited by the hr department to a facebook group of their peers and are expected to befriend one another and members of their future teams collaboration among all employees occurs on facebook groups milestones and failures are publicized on the network as well as “faceversaries”—anniversaries of workers’ start dates these are hallowed events acknowledged like birthdays with hundreds of celebratory posts from colleagues and a note from the employee reflecting on what he or she has learned while tagging the bosses and coworkers who made it all possible“after the post this morning i feel less alone”many workers find the approach freeing in february  an engineering director named david ferguson posted to the global facebook employee network an explanation of why the following monday she would arrive as a woman and go by the name deb in september oscar perez a diversity director who posts about life as a gay latino shared thoughts about the day his father became a us citizen “you think it would waste time to sit around and talk about your life but it doesn’t” says sandberg “it actually saves time because it’s so present for people that having an opportunity to talk about it actually helps”facebook celebrates the values of transparency and personal sharing with the exuberance of a company that knows it might be very good for business but the sandberg effect is now showing up at places that don’t capitalize on the human urge to communicate mary barra the ceo of general motors co posts on facebook about issues such as female empowerment another close sandberg friend walmart stores inc ceo doug mcmillon responds to customer complaints on the social network with his personal email address this year he became the first chief executive to be featured in one of the retail giant’s commercials “the reason i share i’m proud of the people i work with”it’s sandberginspired postmodern marketing—a corporate attempt to strengthen bonds with customers via an abundance of sharing that in a prior era might have seemed unbecoming “it makes us trust them more or at a minimum know them more and that’s good for loyalty over time” says mike hoefflinger a former facebook employee who wrote a book about the social network“this younger generation really craves this authenticity this vulnerability” explains kellie mcelhaney a professor at the university of california at berkeley’s haas school of business she sees sandberg as far ahead of the game “when i hang out with these most powerful women particularly in tech they’re just like machines” she says recounting a time she overheard two female executives compare recent results of blood tests to measure their testosterone levels among the regular churn of leadership books a more recent set has emerged promising to teach authenticity and touting research showing that those in upper management who master it will have more swaysandberg employs this soft power even in her conversations with wall street before facebook’s earnings reports are published her team helps her gather compelling anecdotes from advertisers that take advantage of the company’s usertargeting tools she keeps the stories in a list beside her to use as examples on the investor call that accompanies the quarterly release “i’m doing that on purpose on earnings calls and in all my communication because stories are what help us understand things” she saysin facebook’s frank gehrydesigned building  sandberg posts openly about her life and asks colleagues to bring their “whole self” to workphotographer mark peterson for bloomberg businessweekif the company’s new product workplace succeeds sandbergian management will have proven to be scalable various silicon valley startups have tried to create versions of facebook for work slack technology inc the creator of a popular office messaging service is now valued at  billion facebook’s answer provides an officefriendly version of its standard news feed—and a justification for employees to spend even more time on the network early adopters include starbucks viacom and the government of singaporethe attention sandberg’s book is getting comes at a good time for facebook the company has arrived at a moment when it desperately needs to be humanized—when now unimaginably large and influential it’s under assault on a number of fronts for how criminals use facebook live for enabling the proliferation of extremism and for elevating fake news which some critics blame for the election of donald trumpduring barack obama’s presidency silicon valleyites were comfortably ensconced with the liberal elite suddenly they’re being cast as hbvisaabusing terroristenabling globalists sandberg who supported hillary clinton’s presidential candidacy demurred in  when asked if she would accept a political appointment from the first female commanderinchief but there was speculation she might be nudged this year looked like an option b for sandberg politically too and she’s not kicking the shit out of it after she failed to write about the women’s march protests a local tech blog pando daily penned a scathing post charging that her silence was evidence that facebook was “bending over backwards to embrace a donald trump world” sandberg later conceded that she should have posted about the event then she sent a donation to planned parenthood asked how she decides what to post publicly she says “i care about the issues i care about i care about women i care about resilience it’s like anyone else” she spends more time on the posts about “big stuff” like one she did for mother’s day the year after goldberg died in which she talked about criticisms lean in had received for its assumption that all women could lean in neglecting to sufficiently address the reality of for instance solo mothers with lowwage jobs now she explained she’s painfully aware that even with plenty of money and help being a single mother makes leaning in hard with the publication of the new book sandberg is prepared for fresh criticism this time for her personal choices tabloids are already commenting on her dating life everyone has a different idea about how someone should grieve she sayssandberg has been at facebook for nine years—“a long time for anyone to be anywhere” she says but even though her name is frequently associated with highlevel roles such as walt disney co ceo or california senator she says she’s not going anywhere her argument is as always deployed with data and a handy vignette research shows that after experiencing a death it’s common for people to want to do something meaningful with their lives she says she thinks her work at facebook is more meaningful than everand in a sense the company is a kind of wealthy nationstate unto itself—one that might grant her more influence than she would have as a politician alongside encouraging warm open conversation among employees she and zuckerberg have implemented longer bereavement plans and more flex time for coping with life tragedies policies which if they spread to other companies would offer a tangible payoff for all this jobmandated vulnerability “i work on something i really believe in with my best friend i think i’m doing this” she says of her intention to stay put “i don’t know how many times to say it”  corrects spelling of deutch’s name in the th paragraph  sheryl sandberg  technology  the guardian

barriers that women create for themselves through internalizing systematic discrimination and societal gender roles sandberg argues that in order for change to happen women need to break down these societal and personal barriers by striving for and achieving leadership roles the ultimate goal is to encourage women to lean in to positions of leadership because she believes that by having more

minds that’s especially hard for women because we live in the same house as the socalled superior group and don’t have a neighbourhood of our own much less a country with her new foundation and book lean in sheryl sandberg is opposing both external and internal barriers to equality which is one reason she’s misunderstood in an eitheror world another is that she herself is successful for a woman
