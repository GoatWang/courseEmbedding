paternity divorce modification faq why do i need a lawyer when the insurance company has offered to pay my medical bills florida law provided for an injured person to be compensated or made whole by the responsible party obviously the extent of compensation will vary depending on the specific facts or a case in many cases however full compensation may include elements of damage other than payment of medical bills such as payment for pain and suffering mental anguish loss of ability to enjoy life lost wages and diminished earning capacity this is why early consultation with a lawyer experienced in personal injury cases can help you obtain the maximum recovery allowed by the law what should i look for in choosing a lawyer to represent me before hiring a lawyer you should research the law firm and lawyers you are considering to represent you ask for information about the lawyer’s education training and experience and ask the lawyer to tell you about hisher experience in dealing with cases similar to yours ask about the lawyer’s trial and courtroom experience and assure yourself that if your case goes to trial your lawyer has the knowledge and experience to take you there ask the lawyer to go over the attorney’s fee contract with you in detail and be sure you understand how the lawyer’s fees and costs will be paid at the end of the case how can i afford a lawyer most trial lawyers are willing to handle personal injury cases on a contingency fee basis this means that the lawyer will not charge you a fee for his time unless there is a recovery if a recovery is made then the attorney’s fee is based on an agreed percentage of the gross amount recovered the lawyers at johnson  williams pa charge contingency fees in accordance with the florida supreme court guidelines typically  in a case that is settled before the need for a lawsuit arises and  when a lawsuit becomes necessary and is contested the contingent attorney’s fee does not include the costs of pursuing a claim which may range from just a few hundred dollars to tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars these costs are payable separately and not as a part of the contingent fee although many law firms may require you to pay these costs in advance at johnson and williams pa we understand that the consequences of an injury make it difficult if not impossible for our clients to advance the costs of a case in most cases we pay the costs and simply ask to be reimbursed at the conclusion of a case when your recovery is received will i have to put up any money to get started typically no the majority of cased we handle involve a contingency fee contract that means we do not get paid unless and until our client makes a recovery in some unique circumstances we will represent a client on an hourlyfee basis if the case calls for such an arrangement in either case the fee and cost agreement you have with our firm will be explained to you in detail before we begin pursuit of your claim isnt it expensive to pursue a claim involving serious injuries medical malpractice or a defective product who pays for the outof pocket expenses to prosecute my case indeed it can be very expensive to pursue claims involving serious injuries medical malpractice and defective products it is not uncommon for the costs in such cases to exceed many tens of thousand dollars at johnson and williams pa we understand that the expenses of pursuing significant cases can be substantial accordingly we have positioned ourselves to be able to advance the costs necessary to prepare cases properly for trial ultimately outofpocket expenses are a client’s responsibility in a successfullyconcluded case while a case is pending we generally advance the expenses incurred during our representation if and when the case reaches a successful conclusion the costs we have expended are returned to us out of your recovery what is my case worth every case is unique before an accurate determination of the value of your personal injury case can be made your doctors must have determined that you have reached maximum medical improvement and we must have a thorough understanding of your course of medical treatment your current condition and your future prognosis additionally we must have had an opportunity to completely investigate the details of the accident and analyze the impact that the accident has had on your wageearning ability and on your lifestyle only then can an experienced and knowledgeable personal injury attorney accurately determine the value of your case you should be wary of any law firm that purports to put a specific value on your claim before having an opportunity to learn all of the relevant facts and determine the impact that the accident will have on your future im not the suing type is there any way my claim can be resolved without actually filing a lawsuit you should know that the vast majority of personal injury claims are resolved before a jury reaches a verdict at trial many cases are settled even before a lawsuit must be filed the ultimate decision about whether to file a lawsuit at all is the client’s at johnson and williams pa we are committed to helping our clients reach a satisfactory conclusion to their claim whether by a lawsuit and trial or by some alternative means our lawyers are experienced in alternative dispute resolution procedures such as mediation and arbitration that can avoid the need to file a lawsuit altogether in all cases we take the time to explain to our clients the alternatives available including the risks and advantages of each so that our clients can make an informed decision that is best for his or her individual circumstances will my case go to trial if we do not have to file suit it is welldocumented that most lawsuits that are filed are settled before trial regardless we prepare every case as if it might ultimately be decided by a jury we believe in being prepared in the event an agreement between the parties cannot be reached at the same time our philosophy is to aggressively pursue resolution of claims at all stages in the case so that the process does not become unduly difficult burdensome or expensive for our clients and so that we obtain the best results possible ive heard that jury awards are more conservative than they used to be and that the large verdicts i read about in the newspaper are unusual is this true studies show that verdict trends have moved in a more conservative direction over the past several years both with respect to the probability of a verdict in the plaintiff’s favor and the amount of damages awarded the popular media focus on the unusual verdicts and tend to sensationalize jury awards that are exceptional do not be misled into thinking that juries routinely award large amounts of money for personal injury claims the results in any case depend on its particular facts and the effectiveness of your legal representation sir william johnson

empire as a young man johnson moved to the province of new york to manage an estate purchased by his uncle admiral peter warren which was located amidst the mohawk one of the six nations of the iroquois league johnson learned the mohawk language and iroquois customs and was appointed the british agent to the iroquois because of his success he was appointed in  as british superintendent of indian affairs for the northern colonies throughout his career as a british official among the iroquois johnson combined personal business with official diplomacy acquiring tens of thousands of acres of native land and becoming very wealthy johnson commanded iroquois and colonial militia forces during the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war – in europe his role in the british victory at the battle of lake george in  earned him a baronetcy his capture of fort niagara from the french in  brought him additional renown serving as the british superintendent of

years  marriage and family  death and legacy  in popular culture  ancestors  references  external links early life and careeredit william johnson was born around  in county meath in the kingdom of ireland he was the eldest son of christopher johnson – of smithstown co meath and anne warren daughter of michael warren of warrenstown co meath and catherine aylmer sister of admiral matthew aylmer st baron aylmer his mother anne was from an old english catholic gentry family who had in previous generations lost much of their status to protestant english colonists christopher johnson was descended from the oneill of the fews dynasty of county armagh william johnsons paternal grandfather was originally known as william macshane but changed his surname to johnson the anglicisation of the gaelic mac seáin some early biographers portrayed william johnson as living in poverty in ireland but modern studies reveal that his family lived a comfortable if modest lifestyle although the johnson family had a history of jacobitism william johnsons uncle peter warren was raised as a protestant to enable him to pursue a career in the british royal navy he achieved considerable success gaining wealth along the way admiral sir peter warren c  as a catholic william johnson had limited opportunities for advancement in the british empire never particularly religious johnson converted to protestantism when offered an opportunity to work for his uncle in british america immigration to the coloniesedit william johnson negotiating with a mohawk chief history of the city of new york  peter warren had purchased a large tract of undeveloped land along the south side of the mohawk river in the province of new york warren convinced johnson to lead an effort to establish a settlement there to be known as warrensburgh with the implied understanding that johnson would inherit much of the land johnson arrived in about  with twelve irish protestant families and began to clear the land he purchased african slaves to do the heavy labor of clearance they were the first of many slaves bought by johnson warren intended johnson to become involved in trading with american indians but johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north on the opposite side of the river from warrensburgh acting on his own initiative in  johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river where he built a store and a sawmill from this location which he called mount johnson johnson was able to cut into albanys indian trade he supplied traders with goods who were going to fort oswego and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver he dealt directly with new york city merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at albany the albany merchants were irate and warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent johnson became closely associated with the mohawk the easternmost nation of the six nations of the iroquois league by the time johnson arrived their population had collapsed to only  due to chronic infectious diseases unwittingly introduced by europeans and warfare with competing tribes related to the lucrative beaver trade the mohawk thought an alliance with johnson could advance their interests in the british imperial system sometime around  they adopted him as an honorary sachem or civil chief and gave him the name warraghiyagey which he translated as a man who undertakes great things king georges waredit in  the war of the austrian succession spread to colonial america where it was known as king georges war because of his close relationship with the mohawk in  johnson was appointed as new yorks agent to the iroquois replacing the albanybased indian commissioners the newly created colonel of the warriors of the six nations was instructed to enlist and equip colonists and indians for a campaign against the french recruiting iroquois warriors was difficult ever since the socalled grand settlement of  the iroquois had maintained a policy of neutrality in colonial wars between france and great britain working with the mohawk chief hendrick theyanoguin johnson was able to recruit mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the british johnson organised small raiding parties which were sent against the settlements of the french and their indian allies in accordance with new yorks scalp act of  johnson paid bounties for scalps although he realised this encouraged the scalping of noncombatants of all ages and both sexes in june  johnson was made colonel of the new york levies a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at albany in july  word was received of a peace settlement the mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war which lessened johnsons prestige among them for a while in  johnson built a new stone house upriver from mount johnson which became known as fort johnson the home was heavily fortified when the next war approached in  johnson shifted the primary meeting place for diplomatic councils between the british and the iroquois from albany to fort johnson he also bought houses in schenectady and albany to stop at on his business trips to new york city after king georges war johnson was caught between rival new york political factions one faction was led by governor george clinton who had appointed johnson as new yorks indian agent and in  appointed him to the governors council governor clinton urged the new york assembly to repay johnsons outstanding wartime expenses which amounted to £ repayment was blocked by clintons political rivals a faction led by lieutenant governor james de lancey who was connected to the albany indian commissioners whom johnson had supplanted de lancey was also the brotherinlaw of admiral peter warren which added to the strain in the relationship between johnson and warren an exasperated johnson resigned as new yorks indian commissioner in  when warren died in july  he left nothing to johnson in his will although warren died a very wealthy man in his will he required that johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling warrens land french and indian waredit further information great britain in the seven years war in june  hendrick theyanoguin and a delegation of mohawk travelled to new york city where they announced to governor clinton that the covenant chain—the diplomatic relationship between the british and the iroquois—was broken the british government ordered clinton to convene the albany congress of  to repair the covenant chain at the congress the mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if johnson were reinstated as their agent this mezzotint of william johnson was published in london in  johnsons reinstatement as indian agent came the following year just as the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war was escalating in  major general edward braddock sent to north america to direct the british war effort appointed johnson as his agent to the iroquois although johnson had little military experience he was commissioned as a major general and instructed to lead an expedition against the french fort at crown point his troops were provincial soldiers paid for by the colonies and not regular soldiers of the british army which meant that he had to deal with six different colonial governments while organising the expedition johnson initially had nearly  colonials at his command but general william shirley the governor of massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to fort niagara shifted some of johnsons men and resources to his own campaign tensions escalated as the two generals worked against each other in recruiting native allies the dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure as braddocks secondincommand general shirley was johnsons superior officer but when it came to indian affairs johnson was theoretically in charge in time shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on johnsons refusal to provide him with adequate indian support according to the johnson biographer milton hamilton historians usually portrayed johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with shirley but hamilton argued that johnson was reacting to shirleys clumsy indian diplomacy which harmed the british relationship with the six nations crown point expeditionedit marching north into french territory in august  johnson renamed lac du saintsacrement to lake george in honour of his king on  september  johnsons forces held their ground in the battle of lake george johnson was wounded by a ball that was to remain in his hip or thigh for the rest of his life hendrick theyanoguin johnsons mohawk ally was killed in the battle and baron dieskau the french commander was captured johnson prevented the mohawk from killing the wounded dieskau a compassionate rescue that would become famous in paintings of the event benjamin wests painting of johnson sparing baron dieskaus life after the battle of lake george the battle brought an end to the expedition against crown point and johnson built fort william henry at lake george to strengthen british defences in december tired of army life johnson resigned his commission as major general general shirley who had become the commander in chief upon braddocks death sought to have johnsons commission as indian agent modified so that johnson would be placed under his command but shirley was soon replaced both as governor and commander in chief and johnsons star was on the rise although the battle of lake george was hardly a decisive victory the british needed a military hero in a year of major setbacks and johnson became that man claims that johnson had been disabled by his wound early in the battle and thus did not participate in the victory did not reduce the recognition given to him as a reward for his services parliament voted johnson £ and king george made him a baronet never was such an insignificant encounter so generously rewarded wrote the historian julian gwyn in january  the british government made johnson sole superintendent of indian affairs for the northern colonies this position gave him great influence and power since he would report directly to the government in london and would not be controlled by provincial governments as the department was a military one of all the indian nations in the northern colonies johnson was most knowledgeable about and most closely connected to the iroquois six nations especially the mohawk as superintendent he would make the iroquois the focus of british diplomacy promoting and even exaggerating the power of the iroquois confederacy johnson also began a long process of trying to control iroquois diplomacy attempting nothing less than the refurbishment of the iroquois confederacy with himself as its centre capture of fort niagaraedit although johnson was no longer a british general he continued to lead iroquois and frontier militia in august  after the french began their siege of fort william henry johnson arrived at fort edward with  indians and  militia greatly overestimating the size of the french army british general daniel webb decided against sending a relief force from fort edward to fort william henry the british were compelled to surrender fort william henry after which many were killed in an infamous massacre stories circulated that johnson was enraged by webbs decision not to send help and that he stripped naked in front of webb to express his disgust with the war going badly for the british johnson found it difficult to enlist the support of the six nations who were not eager to join a losing cause in july  he managed to raise  warriors to take part in a massive expedition led by the new british commander general james abercrombie the campaign ended ingloriously with abercrombies disastrous attempt to take fort carillon from the french johnson and his indian auxiliaries could do little as british forces stormed the french positions in fruitless frontal assaults johnson in green is depicted in benjamin wests iconic painting the death of general wolfe although he was not present at the event in  with the capture of louisbourg fort frontenac and fort duquesne the wars momentum began to shift in favour of the british johnson was able to recruit more iroquois warriors in the summer of  he led nearly  iroquois warriors—practically the entire military strength of the six nations—as part of general john prideauxs expedition to capture fort niagara when prideaux was killed johnson took command he captured the fort after ambushing and defeating a french relief force at the battle of la bellefamille johnson is usually credited with leading or at least planning this ambush but the historian francis jennings argued that johnson was not present at the battle and that he exaggerated his role in official dispatches the conquest of niagara drove the french line back from the great lakes once more johnson was celebrated as a hero although some professional soldiers expressed doubts about his military abilities and the value of the iroquois in the victory johnson commanded the largest native american force ever assembled under the british flag johnson accompanied general jeffrey amherst in the final north american campaign of the seven years war the capture of montreal in  with the fall of new france to the british johnson and his deputy george croghan spent much time negotiating with the former indian allies of the french in  johnson made a mile  km round trip to detroit to hold a conference with the regional american indians johnson confronted the assembled chiefs about the antibritish rumours that were circulating among the natives and managed for the time being to forestall outright resistance to the british military occupation of the west normand macleod met johnson at this conference and returned with him to new york macleod was later appointed as commander of fort oswego on lake ontario postwar developmentedit after the french and indian war johnson hoped to concentrate on expanding and improving his land holdings in december  the mohawk of canajoharie gave johnson a tract of about  acres  km north of the mohawk river this grant proved to be controversial because other land speculators had already obtained licenses to purchase lands that the mohawk released for sale but sir william had not in  after years of manoeuvring and lobbying johnson finally gained royal approval for the grant this was one of several large tracts of land that johnson acquired from the mohawk and iroquois using his position as a royal indian agent by the time of his death johnson had accumulated about  acres  km and was one of the largest land owners in british america surpassed only by the penn and van rennsalaer familiescitation needed according to historian julian gwyn in all this he acted no differently from dozens of other speculators in indian lands he was distinguished only by the great advantages he possessed through his office and through his long intimacy with the indians he was indeed one of their principal exploiters in  johnson founded the city of johnstown on his grant about  miles  km west of schenectady new york north of the mohawk river he named the new settlement originally called johns town after his son john there at crown expense he established a free school for both white and mohawk children johnson hosting an iroquois conference at johnson hall in  painting by e l henry  outside the town in  he built johnson hall where he lived until his death he recruited numerous irish immigrant tenant farmers for his extensive lands and lived essentially as a feudal landlord he also purchased africanamerican slaves to work as labourers especially in his lumber operations johnson had some  slaves working for him making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province comparable to major planters of the south in  johnson organised st patricks lodge no  a freemason lodge at johnson hall and was installed as its master his nephew guy johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in  johnson was a strong supporter of the anglican church in the colony to counter the influence of french catholic missionaries in western new york in  he paid for the construction of an anglican church for the mohawk of canajoharie a village the british called the upper castle the building later used by europeanamerican congregations and known as indian castle church still stands near danube new york it is part of the mohawk upper castle historic district a national historic landmark in  johnson built st johns episcopal church in johnstown but soon complained that it was small and very ill built within five years he arranged for a larger church of stone to be constructed to accommodate the growing congregation in johnstown the historic church is still operating pontiacs war and final yearsedit in  pontiacs war resulted from native american discontent with british policy following the french and indian war for several years prior to the uprising johnson had advised general jeffrey amherst to observe iroquois diplomatic practices for instance awarding gifts to native leaders a practice they considered an important cultural symbol of respect and significant to maintaining good relations amherst who rejected johnsons advice was recalled to london and replaced by general thomas gage amhersts recall strengthened johnsons position because a policy of compromise was required with the indians and this was johnsons domain johnson negotiated a treaty with pontiac in  which finally ended the war from july to august  johnson negotiated a treaty at fort niagara with about  american indians in attendance primarily iroquois although most iroquois had stayed out of the war the seneca from the genesee river valley had taken up arms against the british and johnson worked to bring them back into the covenant chain alliance johnson convinced the iroquois to send a war party against the seneca involved in the uprising but otherwise the iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as johnson had desired johnson was a proponent of the royal proclamation of  which called for tighter imperial control and restraint of westward colonial expansion johnson negotiated the details of the boundary defined in the fort stanwix treaty of  against instructions from london johnson pushed the boundary  miles  km to the west enabling him and other land speculators to acquire much more land than originally authorised by the british government johnson was strongly criticised for exceeding his instructions but many of the land speculators were wellconnected in the government and the expanded boundary was allowed to stand native american discontent continued to grow in the west in the s johnson spent his final years attempting to prevent another uprising like pontiacs war pursuing a policy of divide and rule he worked to block the emergence of intertribal native american alliances his final success was his isolation of the shawnee before dunmores war in  marriage and familyedit in his lifetime johnson gained a reputation as a man who had numerous children with several european and native american women at the time men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children as long as they could afford it and supported them one thcentury scholar estimated that johnson had perhaps  illegitimate children but the historian francis jennings argued that there is no truth in wild stories that he slept with innumerable mohawk women in his will johnson acknowledged children by catherine weisenberg and molly brant german and mohawk respectively with whom he had longterm relationships he implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers sir john johnson nd baronet joseph brant in  shortly after arriving in america william began a relationship with catherine weisenberg c – a german electorate of the palatinate immigrant she originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant but had run away perhaps with the help of friends or relatives according to tradition she was working for another family near warrensburgh when johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper there is no record that the couple ever formally married weisenberg was johnsons commonlaw wife the couple had three children including daughters nancy and mary polly and a son john first christened under only weisenbergs name at fort hunter the senior johnson later arranged for his son john to inherit his title and estates as john johnson a grandson of sir william johnson was the rd baronet sir adam gordon johnson who was through his mother ann watts descendants of the schuyler family the delancey family and the van cortlandt family of british north america at the same time johnson had a relationship with elizabeth brant a mohawk woman by whom he had three children keghneghtago or brant born in  thomas  and christian  the latter two boys died in infancy about  johnson had a son named tagawirunta also known as william of canajoharie by a mohawk woman possibly margaret brant elizabeths younger sister johnson may have also been intimate with the sisters susannah and elizabeth wormwood and an irish woman named mary mcgrath by whom he appeared to have had a daughter named mary mary keghneghtago brant and tagawirunta william received inheritances in johnsons will in  johnson began a commonlaw relationship with molly brant a mohawk woman who moved into johnson hall and lived with johnson as his consort for the rest of his life molly was the older sister of joseph brant her younger brother joined the household when he was young johnsons relationship with molly gave him additional influence with the mohawk the couple had eight children all of whom received land from johnson in his will a grandson of william johnson and molly brant was william johnson kerr who married elizabeth brant a daughter of joseph brant and granddaughter of george croghan death and legacyedit it is mostly believed that william johnson died from a stroke at johnson hall on  july  during an indian conference guy johnson williams nephew and soninlaw he had married marypolly reported that johnson died when he was seized of a suffocation his funeral in johnstown was attended by more than  people his pallbearers included governor william franklin of new jersey and the justices of the new york supreme court he was buried beneath the altar in st johns anglican church the church he founded in johnstown the next day chiefs of the six nations performed the traditional iroquois condolence ceremony and recognised guy johnson as sir williams successor during the american revolution the rebel new york legislature seized all of johnsons lands and property as his heirs were loyalists in  johnson hall was named a national historic landmark it is a designated state historic site and open to the public johnsons most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful coexistence of angloamericans and indians during his tenure as indian agent for british north america as an adopted mohawk chief and husband according to iroquois law of mohawk mary brant he was a trusted counselor and member of mohawk nation and through that affiliation the five nations of the iroquois that position gave him standing not only to lead iroquois into battle on the side of the english but also to negotiate two treaties of fort stanwix modern day rome ny while the treaties deprived many indians of land without their knowledge they gave favourable terms to the iroquois and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional indian residents and new settlers coexistence was part of johnsons other major historical legacy the protection of british sovereignty and angloamerican settlement as a bulwark against french control of northern new york state and the great lakes region more generally johnson was instrumental in sustaining britishiroquois alliance through the covenant chain which consolidated both iroquois and british territorial and commercial interests against the rival algoonquin and french interests in new france before  after britain assumed control johnson eventually won a political dispute over indian policy with lord jeffrey amherst who disdained the iroquois alliance johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending it was to johnson that pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him old fort johnson his first home built in  is on the historic american buildings survey it is currently the home of the montgomery county historical society which operates a museum gift shop and holds events guy park manor built in  for sir williams daughter

indian affairs for the northern colonies throughout his career as a british official among the iroquois johnson combined personal business with official diplomacy acquiring tens of thousands of acres of native land and becoming very wealthy johnson commanded iroquois and colonial militia forces during the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war – in europe his role in the british victory at the battle of lake george in  earned him a baronetcy his capture of fort niagara from the french in  brought him additional renown serving as the british superintendent of

years  marriage and family  death and legacy  in popular culture  ancestors  references  external links early life and careeredit william johnson was born around  in county meath in the kingdom of ireland he was the eldest son of christopher johnson – of smithstown co meath and anne warren daughter of michael warren of warrenstown co meath and catherine aylmer sister of admiral matthew aylmer st baron aylmer his mother anne was from an old english catholic gentry family who had in previous generations lost much of their status to protestant english colonists christopher johnson was descended from the oneill of the fews dynasty of county armagh william johnsons paternal grandfather was originally known as william macshane but changed his surname to johnson the anglicisation of the gaelic mac seáin some early biographers portrayed william johnson as living in poverty in ireland but modern studies reveal that his family lived a comfortable if modest lifestyle although the johnson family had a history of jacobitism william johnsons uncle peter warren was raised as a protestant to enable him to pursue a career in the british royal navy he achieved considerable success gaining wealth along the way admiral sir peter warren c  as a catholic william johnson had limited opportunities for advancement in the british empire never particularly religious johnson converted to protestantism when offered an opportunity to work for his uncle in british america immigration to the coloniesedit william johnson negotiating with a mohawk chief history of the city of new york  peter warren had purchased a large tract of undeveloped land along the south side of the mohawk river in the province of new york warren convinced johnson to lead an effort to establish a settlement there to be known as warrensburgh with the implied understanding that johnson would inherit much of the land johnson arrived in about  with twelve irish protestant families and began to clear the land he purchased african slaves to do the heavy labor of clearance they were the first of many slaves bought by johnson warren intended johnson to become involved in trading with american indians but johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north on the opposite side of the river from warrensburgh acting on his own initiative in  johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river where he built a store and a sawmill from this location which he called mount johnson johnson was able to cut into albanys indian trade he supplied traders with goods who were going to fort oswego and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver he dealt directly with new york city merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at albany the albany merchants were irate and warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent johnson became closely associated with the mohawk the easternmost nation of the six nations of the iroquois league by the time johnson arrived their population had collapsed to only  due to chronic infectious diseases unwittingly introduced by europeans and warfare with competing tribes related to the lucrative beaver trade the mohawk thought an alliance with johnson could advance their interests in the british imperial system sometime around  they adopted him as an honorary sachem or civil chief and gave him the name warraghiyagey which he translated as a man who undertakes great things king georges waredit in  the war of the austrian succession spread to colonial america where it was known as king georges war because of his close relationship with the mohawk in  johnson was appointed as new yorks agent to the iroquois replacing the albanybased indian commissioners the newly created colonel of the warriors of the six nations was instructed to enlist and equip colonists and indians for a campaign against the french recruiting iroquois warriors was difficult ever since the socalled grand settlement of  the iroquois had maintained a policy of neutrality in colonial wars between france and great britain working with the mohawk chief hendrick theyanoguin johnson was able to recruit mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the british johnson organised small raiding parties which were sent against the settlements of the french and their indian allies in accordance with new yorks scalp act of  johnson paid bounties for scalps although he realised this encouraged the scalping of noncombatants of all ages and both sexes in june  johnson was made colonel of the new york levies a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at albany in july  word was received of a peace settlement the mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war which lessened johnsons prestige among them for a while in  johnson built a new stone house upriver from mount johnson which became known as fort johnson the home was heavily fortified when the next war approached in  johnson shifted the primary meeting place for diplomatic councils between the british and the iroquois from albany to fort johnson he also bought houses in schenectady and albany to stop at on his business trips to new york city after king georges war johnson was caught between rival new york political factions one faction was led by governor george clinton who had appointed johnson as new yorks indian agent and in  appointed him to the governors council governor clinton urged the new york assembly to repay johnsons outstanding wartime expenses which amounted to £ repayment was blocked by clintons political rivals a faction led by lieutenant governor james de lancey who was connected to the albany indian commissioners whom johnson had supplanted de lancey was also the brotherinlaw of admiral peter warren which added to the strain in the relationship between johnson and warren an exasperated johnson resigned as new yorks indian commissioner in  when warren died in july  he left nothing to johnson in his will although warren died a very wealthy man in his will he required that johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling warrens land french and indian waredit further information great britain in the seven years war in june  hendrick theyanoguin and a delegation of mohawk travelled to new york city where they announced to governor clinton that the covenant chain—the diplomatic relationship between the british and the iroquois—was broken the british government ordered clinton to convene the albany congress of  to repair the covenant chain at the congress the mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if johnson were reinstated as their agent this mezzotint of william johnson was published in london in  johnsons reinstatement as indian agent came the following year just as the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war was escalating in  major general edward braddock sent to north america to direct the british war effort appointed johnson as his agent to the iroquois although johnson had little military experience he was commissioned as a major general and instructed to lead an expedition against the french fort at crown point his troops were provincial soldiers paid for by the colonies and not regular soldiers of the british army which meant that he had to deal with six different colonial governments while organising the expedition johnson initially had nearly  colonials at his command but general william shirley the governor of massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to fort niagara shifted some of johnsons men and resources to his own campaign tensions escalated as the two generals worked against each other in recruiting native allies the dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure as braddocks secondincommand general shirley was johnsons superior officer but when it came to indian affairs johnson was theoretically in charge in time shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on johnsons refusal to provide him with adequate indian support according to the johnson biographer milton hamilton historians usually portrayed johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with shirley but hamilton argued that johnson was reacting to shirleys clumsy indian diplomacy which harmed the british relationship with the six nations crown point expeditionedit marching north into french territory in august  johnson renamed lac du saintsacrement to lake george in honour of his king on  september  johnsons forces held their ground in the battle of lake george johnson was wounded by a ball that was to remain in his hip or thigh for the rest of his life hendrick theyanoguin johnsons mohawk ally was killed in the battle and baron dieskau the french commander was captured johnson prevented the mohawk from killing the wounded dieskau a compassionate rescue that would become famous in paintings of the event benjamin wests painting of johnson sparing baron dieskaus life after the battle of lake george the battle brought an end to the expedition against crown point and johnson built fort william henry at lake george to strengthen british defences in december tired of army life johnson resigned his commission as major general general shirley who had become the commander in chief upon braddocks death sought to have johnsons commission as indian agent modified so that johnson would be placed under his command but shirley was soon replaced both as governor and commander in chief and johnsons star was on the rise although the battle of lake george was hardly a decisive victory the british needed a military hero in a year of major setbacks and johnson became that man claims that johnson had been disabled by his wound early in the battle and thus did not participate in the victory did not reduce the recognition given to him as a reward for his services parliament voted johnson £ and king george made him a baronet never was such an insignificant encounter so generously rewarded wrote the historian julian gwyn in january  the british government made johnson sole superintendent of indian affairs for the northern colonies this position gave him great influence and power since he would report directly to the government in london and would not be controlled by provincial governments as the department was a military one of all the indian nations in the northern colonies johnson was most knowledgeable about and most closely connected to the iroquois six nations especially the mohawk as superintendent he would make the iroquois the focus of british diplomacy promoting and even exaggerating the power of the iroquois confederacy johnson also began a long process of trying to control iroquois diplomacy attempting nothing less than the refurbishment of the iroquois confederacy with himself as its centre capture of fort niagaraedit although johnson was no longer a british general he continued to lead iroquois and frontier militia in august  after the french began their siege of fort william henry johnson arrived at fort edward with  indians and  militia greatly overestimating the size of the french army british general daniel webb decided against sending a relief force from fort edward to fort william henry the british were compelled to surrender fort william henry after which many were killed in an infamous massacre stories circulated that johnson was enraged by webbs decision not to send help and that he stripped naked in front of webb to express his disgust with the war going badly for the british johnson found it difficult to enlist the support of the six nations who were not eager to join a losing cause in july  he managed to raise  warriors to take part in a massive expedition led by the new british commander general james abercrombie the campaign ended ingloriously with abercrombies disastrous attempt to take fort carillon from the french johnson and his indian auxiliaries could do little as british forces stormed the french positions in fruitless frontal assaults johnson in green is depicted in benjamin wests iconic painting the death of general wolfe although he was not present at the event in  with the capture of louisbourg fort frontenac and fort duquesne the wars momentum began to shift in favour of the british johnson was able to recruit more iroquois warriors in the summer of  he led nearly  iroquois warriors—practically the entire military strength of the six nations—as part of general john prideauxs expedition to capture fort niagara when prideaux was killed johnson took command he captured the fort after ambushing and defeating a french relief force at the battle of la bellefamille johnson is usually credited with leading or at least planning this ambush but the historian francis jennings argued that johnson was not present at the battle and that he exaggerated his role in official dispatches the conquest of niagara drove the french line back from the great lakes once more johnson was celebrated as a hero although some professional soldiers expressed doubts about his military abilities and the value of the iroquois in the victory johnson commanded the largest native american force ever assembled under the british flag johnson accompanied general jeffrey amherst in the final north american campaign of the seven years war the capture of montreal in  with the fall of new france to the british johnson and his deputy george croghan spent much time negotiating with the former indian allies of the french in  johnson made a mile  km round trip to detroit to hold a conference with the regional american indians johnson confronted the assembled chiefs about the antibritish rumours that were circulating among the natives and managed for the time being to forestall outright resistance to the british military occupation of the west normand macleod met johnson at this conference and returned with him to new york macleod was later appointed as commander of fort oswego on lake ontario postwar developmentedit after the french and indian war johnson hoped to concentrate on expanding and improving his land holdings in december  the mohawk of canajoharie gave johnson a tract of about  acres  km north of the mohawk river this grant proved to be controversial because other land speculators had already obtained licenses to purchase lands that the mohawk released for sale but sir william had not in  after years of manoeuvring and lobbying johnson finally gained royal approval for the grant this was one of several large tracts of land that johnson acquired from the mohawk and iroquois using his position as a royal indian agent by the time of his death johnson had accumulated about  acres  km and was one of the largest land owners in british america surpassed only by the penn and van rennsalaer familiescitation needed according to historian julian gwyn in all this he acted no differently from dozens of other speculators in indian lands he was distinguished only by the great advantages he possessed through his office and through his long intimacy with the indians he was indeed one of their principal exploiters in  johnson founded the city of johnstown on his grant about  miles  km west of schenectady new york north of the mohawk river he named the new settlement originally called johns town after his son john there at crown expense he established a free school for both white and mohawk children johnson hosting an iroquois conference at johnson hall in  painting by e l henry  outside the town in  he built johnson hall where he lived until his death he recruited numerous irish immigrant tenant farmers for his extensive lands and lived essentially as a feudal landlord he also purchased africanamerican slaves to work as labourers especially in his lumber operations johnson had some  slaves working for him making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province comparable to major planters of the south in  johnson organised st patricks lodge no  a freemason lodge at johnson hall and was installed as its master his nephew guy johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in  johnson was a strong supporter of the anglican church in the colony to counter the influence of french catholic missionaries in western new york in  he paid for the construction of an anglican church for the mohawk of canajoharie a village the british called the upper castle the building later used by europeanamerican congregations and known as indian castle church still stands near danube new york it is part of the mohawk upper castle historic district a national historic landmark in  johnson built st johns episcopal church in johnstown but soon complained that it was small and very ill built within five years he arranged for a larger church of stone to be constructed to accommodate the growing congregation in johnstown the historic church is still operating pontiacs war and final yearsedit in  pontiacs war resulted from native american discontent with british policy following the french and indian war for several years prior to the uprising johnson had advised general jeffrey amherst to observe iroquois diplomatic practices for instance awarding gifts to native leaders a practice they considered an important cultural symbol of respect and significant to maintaining good relations amherst who rejected johnsons advice was recalled to london and replaced by general thomas gage amhersts recall strengthened johnsons position because a policy of compromise was required with the indians and this was johnsons domain johnson negotiated a treaty with pontiac in  which finally ended the war from july to august  johnson negotiated a treaty at fort niagara with about  american indians in attendance primarily iroquois although most iroquois had stayed out of the war the seneca from the genesee river valley had taken up arms against the british and johnson worked to bring them back into the covenant chain alliance johnson convinced the iroquois to send a war party against the seneca involved in the uprising but otherwise the iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as johnson had desired johnson was a proponent of the royal proclamation of  which called for tighter imperial control and restraint of westward colonial expansion johnson negotiated the details of the boundary defined in the fort stanwix treaty of  against instructions from london johnson pushed the boundary  miles  km to the west enabling him and other land speculators to acquire much more land than originally authorised by the british government johnson was strongly criticised for exceeding his instructions but many of the land speculators were wellconnected in the government and the expanded boundary was allowed to stand native american discontent continued to grow in the west in the s johnson spent his final years attempting to prevent another uprising like pontiacs war pursuing a policy of divide and rule he worked to block the emergence of intertribal native american alliances his final success was his isolation of the shawnee before dunmores war in  marriage and familyedit in his lifetime johnson gained a reputation as a man who had numerous children with several european and native american women at the time men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children as long as they could afford it and supported them one thcentury scholar estimated that johnson had perhaps  illegitimate children but the historian francis jennings argued that there is no truth in wild stories that he slept with innumerable mohawk women in his will johnson acknowledged children by catherine weisenberg and molly brant german and mohawk respectively with whom he had longterm relationships he implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers sir john johnson nd baronet joseph brant in  shortly after arriving in america william began a relationship with catherine weisenberg c – a german electorate of the palatinate immigrant she originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant but had run away perhaps with the help of friends or relatives according to tradition she was working for another family near warrensburgh when johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper there is no record that the couple ever formally married weisenberg was johnsons commonlaw wife the couple had three children including daughters nancy and mary polly and a son john first christened under only weisenbergs name at fort hunter the senior johnson later arranged for his son john to inherit his title and estates as john johnson a grandson of sir william johnson was the rd baronet sir adam gordon johnson who was through his mother ann watts descendants of the schuyler family the delancey family and the van cortlandt family of british north america at the same time johnson had a relationship with elizabeth brant a mohawk woman by whom he had three children keghneghtago or brant born in  thomas  and christian  the latter two boys died in infancy about  johnson had a son named tagawirunta also known as william of canajoharie by a mohawk woman possibly margaret brant elizabeths younger sister johnson may have also been intimate with the sisters susannah and elizabeth wormwood and an irish woman named mary mcgrath by whom he appeared to have had a daughter named mary mary keghneghtago brant and tagawirunta william received inheritances in johnsons will in  johnson began a commonlaw relationship with molly brant a mohawk woman who moved into johnson hall and lived with johnson as his consort for the rest of his life molly was the older sister of joseph brant her younger brother joined the household when he was young johnsons relationship with molly gave him additional influence with the mohawk the couple had eight children all of whom received land from johnson in his will a grandson of william johnson and molly brant was william johnson kerr who married elizabeth brant a daughter of joseph brant and granddaughter of george croghan death and legacyedit it is mostly believed that william johnson died from a stroke at johnson hall on  july  during an indian conference guy johnson williams nephew and soninlaw he had married marypolly reported that johnson died when he was seized of a suffocation his funeral in johnstown was attended by more than  people his pallbearers included governor william franklin of new jersey and the justices of the new york supreme court he was buried beneath the altar in st johns anglican church the church he founded in johnstown the next day chiefs of the six nations performed the traditional iroquois condolence ceremony and recognised guy johnson as sir williams successor during the american revolution the rebel new york legislature seized all of johnsons lands and property as his heirs were loyalists in  johnson hall was named a national historic landmark it is a designated state historic site and open to the public johnsons most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful coexistence of angloamericans and indians during his tenure as indian agent for british north america as an adopted mohawk chief and husband according to iroquois law of mohawk mary brant he was a trusted counselor and member of mohawk nation and through that affiliation the five nations of the iroquois that position gave him standing not only to lead iroquois into battle on the side of the english but also to negotiate two treaties of fort stanwix modern day rome ny while the treaties deprived many indians of land without their knowledge they gave favourable terms to the iroquois and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional indian residents and new settlers coexistence was part of johnsons other major historical legacy the protection of british sovereignty and angloamerican settlement as a bulwark against french control of northern new york state and the great lakes region more generally johnson was instrumental in sustaining britishiroquois alliance through the covenant chain which consolidated both iroquois and british territorial and commercial interests against the rival algoonquin and french interests in new france before  after britain assumed control johnson eventually won a political dispute over indian policy with lord jeffrey amherst who disdained the iroquois alliance johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending it was to johnson that pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him old fort johnson his first home built in  is on the historic american buildings survey it is currently the home of the montgomery county historical society which operates a museum gift shop and holds events guy park manor built in  for sir williams daughter

indian affairs for the northern colonies throughout his career as a british official among the iroquois johnson combined personal business with official diplomacy acquiring tens of thousands of acres of native land and becoming very wealthy johnson commanded iroquois and colonial militia forces during the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war – in europe his role in the british victory at the battle of lake george in  earned him a baronetcy his capture of fort niagara from the french in  brought him additional renown serving as the british superintendent of

years  marriage and family  death and legacy  in popular culture  ancestors  references  external links early life and careeredit william johnson was born around  in county meath in the kingdom of ireland he was the eldest son of christopher johnson – of smithstown co meath and anne warren daughter of michael warren of warrenstown co meath and catherine aylmer sister of admiral matthew aylmer st baron aylmer his mother anne was from an old english catholic gentry family who had in previous generations lost much of their status to protestant english colonists christopher johnson was descended from the oneill of the fews dynasty of county armagh william johnsons paternal grandfather was originally known as william macshane but changed his surname to johnson the anglicisation of the gaelic mac seáin some early biographers portrayed william johnson as living in poverty in ireland but modern studies reveal that his family lived a comfortable if modest lifestyle although the johnson family had a history of jacobitism william johnsons uncle peter warren was raised as a protestant to enable him to pursue a career in the british royal navy he achieved considerable success gaining wealth along the way admiral sir peter warren c  as a catholic william johnson had limited opportunities for advancement in the british empire never particularly religious johnson converted to protestantism when offered an opportunity to work for his uncle in british america immigration to the coloniesedit william johnson negotiating with a mohawk chief history of the city of new york  peter warren had purchased a large tract of undeveloped land along the south side of the mohawk river in the province of new york warren convinced johnson to lead an effort to establish a settlement there to be known as warrensburgh with the implied understanding that johnson would inherit much of the land johnson arrived in about  with twelve irish protestant families and began to clear the land he purchased african slaves to do the heavy labor of clearance they were the first of many slaves bought by johnson warren intended johnson to become involved in trading with american indians but johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north on the opposite side of the river from warrensburgh acting on his own initiative in  johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river where he built a store and a sawmill from this location which he called mount johnson johnson was able to cut into albanys indian trade he supplied traders with goods who were going to fort oswego and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver he dealt directly with new york city merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at albany the albany merchants were irate and warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent johnson became closely associated with the mohawk the easternmost nation of the six nations of the iroquois league by the time johnson arrived their population had collapsed to only  due to chronic infectious diseases unwittingly introduced by europeans and warfare with competing tribes related to the lucrative beaver trade the mohawk thought an alliance with johnson could advance their interests in the british imperial system sometime around  they adopted him as an honorary sachem or civil chief and gave him the name warraghiyagey which he translated as a man who undertakes great things king georges waredit in  the war of the austrian succession spread to colonial america where it was known as king georges war because of his close relationship with the mohawk in  johnson was appointed as new yorks agent to the iroquois replacing the albanybased indian commissioners the newly created colonel of the warriors of the six nations was instructed to enlist and equip colonists and indians for a campaign against the french recruiting iroquois warriors was difficult ever since the socalled grand settlement of  the iroquois had maintained a policy of neutrality in colonial wars between france and great britain working with the mohawk chief hendrick theyanoguin johnson was able to recruit mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the british johnson organised small raiding parties which were sent against the settlements of the french and their indian allies in accordance with new yorks scalp act of  johnson paid bounties for scalps although he realised this encouraged the scalping of noncombatants of all ages and both sexes in june  johnson was made colonel of the new york levies a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at albany in july  word was received of a peace settlement the mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war which lessened johnsons prestige among them for a while in  johnson built a new stone house upriver from mount johnson which became known as fort johnson the home was heavily fortified when the next war approached in  johnson shifted the primary meeting place for diplomatic councils between the british and the iroquois from albany to fort johnson he also bought houses in schenectady and albany to stop at on his business trips to new york city after king georges war johnson was caught between rival new york political factions one faction was led by governor george clinton who had appointed johnson as new yorks indian agent and in  appointed him to the governors council governor clinton urged the new york assembly to repay johnsons outstanding wartime expenses which amounted to £ repayment was blocked by clintons political rivals a faction led by lieutenant governor james de lancey who was connected to the albany indian commissioners whom johnson had supplanted de lancey was also the brotherinlaw of admiral peter warren which added to the strain in the relationship between johnson and warren an exasperated johnson resigned as new yorks indian commissioner in  when warren died in july  he left nothing to johnson in his will although warren died a very wealthy man in his will he required that johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling warrens land french and indian waredit further information great britain in the seven years war in june  hendrick theyanoguin and a delegation of mohawk travelled to new york city where they announced to governor clinton that the covenant chain—the diplomatic relationship between the british and the iroquois—was broken the british government ordered clinton to convene the albany congress of  to repair the covenant chain at the congress the mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if johnson were reinstated as their agent this mezzotint of william johnson was published in london in  johnsons reinstatement as indian agent came the following year just as the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war was escalating in  major general edward braddock sent to north america to direct the british war effort appointed johnson as his agent to the iroquois although johnson had little military experience he was commissioned as a major general and instructed to lead an expedition against the french fort at crown point his troops were provincial soldiers paid for by the colonies and not regular soldiers of the british army which meant that he had to deal with six different colonial governments while organising the expedition johnson initially had nearly  colonials at his command but general william shirley the governor of massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to fort niagara shifted some of johnsons men and resources to his own campaign tensions escalated as the two generals worked against each other in recruiting native allies the dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure as braddocks secondincommand general shirley was johnsons superior officer but when it came to indian affairs johnson was theoretically in charge in time shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on johnsons refusal to provide him with adequate indian support according to the johnson biographer milton hamilton historians usually portrayed johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with shirley but hamilton argued that johnson was reacting to shirleys clumsy indian diplomacy which harmed the british relationship with the six nations crown point expeditionedit marching north into french territory in august  johnson renamed lac du saintsacrement to lake george in honour of his king on  september  johnsons forces held their ground in the battle of lake george johnson was wounded by a ball that was to remain in his hip or thigh for the rest of his life hendrick theyanoguin johnsons mohawk ally was killed in the battle and baron dieskau the french commander was captured johnson prevented the mohawk from killing the wounded dieskau a compassionate rescue that would become famous in paintings of the event benjamin wests painting of johnson sparing baron dieskaus life after the battle of lake george the battle brought an end to the expedition against crown point and johnson built fort william henry at lake george to strengthen british defences in december tired of army life johnson resigned his commission as major general general shirley who had become the commander in chief upon braddocks death sought to have johnsons commission as indian agent modified so that johnson would be placed under his command but shirley was soon replaced both as governor and commander in chief and johnsons star was on the rise although the battle of lake george was hardly a decisive victory the british needed a military hero in a year of major setbacks and johnson became that man claims that johnson had been disabled by his wound early in the battle and thus did not participate in the victory did not reduce the recognition given to him as a reward for his services parliament voted johnson £ and king george made him a baronet never was such an insignificant encounter so generously rewarded wrote the historian julian gwyn in january  the british government made johnson sole superintendent of indian affairs for the northern colonies this position gave him great influence and power since he would report directly to the government in london and would not be controlled by provincial governments as the department was a military one of all the indian nations in the northern colonies johnson was most knowledgeable about and most closely connected to the iroquois six nations especially the mohawk as superintendent he would make the iroquois the focus of british diplomacy promoting and even exaggerating the power of the iroquois confederacy johnson also began a long process of trying to control iroquois diplomacy attempting nothing less than the refurbishment of the iroquois confederacy with himself as its centre capture of fort niagaraedit although johnson was no longer a british general he continued to lead iroquois and frontier militia in august  after the french began their siege of fort william henry johnson arrived at fort edward with  indians and  militia greatly overestimating the size of the french army british general daniel webb decided against sending a relief force from fort edward to fort william henry the british were compelled to surrender fort william henry after which many were killed in an infamous massacre stories circulated that johnson was enraged by webbs decision not to send help and that he stripped naked in front of webb to express his disgust with the war going badly for the british johnson found it difficult to enlist the support of the six nations who were not eager to join a losing cause in july  he managed to raise  warriors to take part in a massive expedition led by the new british commander general james abercrombie the campaign ended ingloriously with abercrombies disastrous attempt to take fort carillon from the french johnson and his indian auxiliaries could do little as british forces stormed the french positions in fruitless frontal assaults johnson in green is depicted in benjamin wests iconic painting the death of general wolfe although he was not present at the event in  with the capture of louisbourg fort frontenac and fort duquesne the wars momentum began to shift in favour of the british johnson was able to recruit more iroquois warriors in the summer of  he led nearly  iroquois warriors—practically the entire military strength of the six nations—as part of general john prideauxs expedition to capture fort niagara when prideaux was killed johnson took command he captured the fort after ambushing and defeating a french relief force at the battle of la bellefamille johnson is usually credited with leading or at least planning this ambush but the historian francis jennings argued that johnson was not present at the battle and that he exaggerated his role in official dispatches the conquest of niagara drove the french line back from the great lakes once more johnson was celebrated as a hero although some professional soldiers expressed doubts about his military abilities and the value of the iroquois in the victory johnson commanded the largest native american force ever assembled under the british flag johnson accompanied general jeffrey amherst in the final north american campaign of the seven years war the capture of montreal in  with the fall of new france to the british johnson and his deputy george croghan spent much time negotiating with the former indian allies of the french in  johnson made a mile  km round trip to detroit to hold a conference with the regional american indians johnson confronted the assembled chiefs about the antibritish rumours that were circulating among the natives and managed for the time being to forestall outright resistance to the british military occupation of the west normand macleod met johnson at this conference and returned with him to new york macleod was later appointed as commander of fort oswego on lake ontario postwar developmentedit after the french and indian war johnson hoped to concentrate on expanding and improving his land holdings in december  the mohawk of canajoharie gave johnson a tract of about  acres  km north of the mohawk river this grant proved to be controversial because other land speculators had already obtained licenses to purchase lands that the mohawk released for sale but sir william had not in  after years of manoeuvring and lobbying johnson finally gained royal approval for the grant this was one of several large tracts of land that johnson acquired from the mohawk and iroquois using his position as a royal indian agent by the time of his death johnson had accumulated about  acres  km and was one of the largest land owners in british america surpassed only by the penn and van rennsalaer familiescitation needed according to historian julian gwyn in all this he acted no differently from dozens of other speculators in indian lands he was distinguished only by the great advantages he possessed through his office and through his long intimacy with the indians he was indeed one of their principal exploiters in  johnson founded the city of johnstown on his grant about  miles  km west of schenectady new york north of the mohawk river he named the new settlement originally called johns town after his son john there at crown expense he established a free school for both white and mohawk children johnson hosting an iroquois conference at johnson hall in  painting by e l henry  outside the town in  he built johnson hall where he lived until his death he recruited numerous irish immigrant tenant farmers for his extensive lands and lived essentially as a feudal landlord he also purchased africanamerican slaves to work as labourers especially in his lumber operations johnson had some  slaves working for him making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province comparable to major planters of the south in  johnson organised st patricks lodge no  a freemason lodge at johnson hall and was installed as its master his nephew guy johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in  johnson was a strong supporter of the anglican church in the colony to counter the influence of french catholic missionaries in western new york in  he paid for the construction of an anglican church for the mohawk of canajoharie a village the british called the upper castle the building later used by europeanamerican congregations and known as indian castle church still stands near danube new york it is part of the mohawk upper castle historic district a national historic landmark in  johnson built st johns episcopal church in johnstown but soon complained that it was small and very ill built within five years he arranged for a larger church of stone to be constructed to accommodate the growing congregation in johnstown the historic church is still operating pontiacs war and final yearsedit in  pontiacs war resulted from native american discontent with british policy following the french and indian war for several years prior to the uprising johnson had advised general jeffrey amherst to observe iroquois diplomatic practices for instance awarding gifts to native leaders a practice they considered an important cultural symbol of respect and significant to maintaining good relations amherst who rejected johnsons advice was recalled to london and replaced by general thomas gage amhersts recall strengthened johnsons position because a policy of compromise was required with the indians and this was johnsons domain johnson negotiated a treaty with pontiac in  which finally ended the war from july to august  johnson negotiated a treaty at fort niagara with about  american indians in attendance primarily iroquois although most iroquois had stayed out of the war the seneca from the genesee river valley had taken up arms against the british and johnson worked to bring them back into the covenant chain alliance johnson convinced the iroquois to send a war party against the seneca involved in the uprising but otherwise the iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as johnson had desired johnson was a proponent of the royal proclamation of  which called for tighter imperial control and restraint of westward colonial expansion johnson negotiated the details of the boundary defined in the fort stanwix treaty of  against instructions from london johnson pushed the boundary  miles  km to the west enabling him and other land speculators to acquire much more land than originally authorised by the british government johnson was strongly criticised for exceeding his instructions but many of the land speculators were wellconnected in the government and the expanded boundary was allowed to stand native american discontent continued to grow in the west in the s johnson spent his final years attempting to prevent another uprising like pontiacs war pursuing a policy of divide and rule he worked to block the emergence of intertribal native american alliances his final success was his isolation of the shawnee before dunmores war in  marriage and familyedit in his lifetime johnson gained a reputation as a man who had numerous children with several european and native american women at the time men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children as long as they could afford it and supported them one thcentury scholar estimated that johnson had perhaps  illegitimate children but the historian francis jennings argued that there is no truth in wild stories that he slept with innumerable mohawk women in his will johnson acknowledged children by catherine weisenberg and molly brant german and mohawk respectively with whom he had longterm relationships he implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers sir john johnson nd baronet joseph brant in  shortly after arriving in america william began a relationship with catherine weisenberg c – a german electorate of the palatinate immigrant she originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant but had run away perhaps with the help of friends or relatives according to tradition she was working for another family near warrensburgh when johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper there is no record that the couple ever formally married weisenberg was johnsons commonlaw wife the couple had three children including daughters nancy and mary polly and a son john first christened under only weisenbergs name at fort hunter the senior johnson later arranged for his son john to inherit his title and estates as john johnson a grandson of sir william johnson was the rd baronet sir adam gordon johnson who was through his mother ann watts descendants of the schuyler family the delancey family and the van cortlandt family of british north america at the same time johnson had a relationship with elizabeth brant a mohawk woman by whom he had three children keghneghtago or brant born in  thomas  and christian  the latter two boys died in infancy about  johnson had a son named tagawirunta also known as william of canajoharie by a mohawk woman possibly margaret brant elizabeths younger sister johnson may have also been intimate with the sisters susannah and elizabeth wormwood and an irish woman named mary mcgrath by whom he appeared to have had a daughter named mary mary keghneghtago brant and tagawirunta william received inheritances in johnsons will in  johnson began a commonlaw relationship with molly brant a mohawk woman who moved into johnson hall and lived with johnson as his consort for the rest of his life molly was the older sister of joseph brant her younger brother joined the household when he was young johnsons relationship with molly gave him additional influence with the mohawk the couple had eight children all of whom received land from johnson in his will a grandson of william johnson and molly brant was william johnson kerr who married elizabeth brant a daughter of joseph brant and granddaughter of george croghan death and legacyedit it is mostly believed that william johnson died from a stroke at johnson hall on  july  during an indian conference guy johnson williams nephew and soninlaw he had married marypolly reported that johnson died when he was seized of a suffocation his funeral in johnstown was attended by more than  people his pallbearers included governor william franklin of new jersey and the justices of the new york supreme court he was buried beneath the altar in st johns anglican church the church he founded in johnstown the next day chiefs of the six nations performed the traditional iroquois condolence ceremony and recognised guy johnson as sir williams successor during the american revolution the rebel new york legislature seized all of johnsons lands and property as his heirs were loyalists in  johnson hall was named a national historic landmark it is a designated state historic site and open to the public johnsons most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful coexistence of angloamericans and indians during his tenure as indian agent for british north america as an adopted mohawk chief and husband according to iroquois law of mohawk mary brant he was a trusted counselor and member of mohawk nation and through that affiliation the five nations of the iroquois that position gave him standing not only to lead iroquois into battle on the side of the english but also to negotiate two treaties of fort stanwix modern day rome ny while the treaties deprived many indians of land without their knowledge they gave favourable terms to the iroquois and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional indian residents and new settlers coexistence was part of johnsons other major historical legacy the protection of british sovereignty and angloamerican settlement as a bulwark against french control of northern new york state and the great lakes region more generally johnson was instrumental in sustaining britishiroquois alliance through the covenant chain which consolidated both iroquois and british territorial and commercial interests against the rival algoonquin and french interests in new france before  after britain assumed control johnson eventually won a political dispute over indian policy with lord jeffrey amherst who disdained the iroquois alliance johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending it was to johnson that pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him old fort johnson his first home built in  is on the historic american buildings survey it is currently the home of the montgomery county historical society which operates a museum gift shop and holds events guy park manor built in  for sir williams daughter

indian affairs for the northern colonies throughout his career as a british official among the iroquois johnson combined personal business with official diplomacy acquiring tens of thousands of acres of native land and becoming very wealthy johnson commanded iroquois and colonial militia forces during the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war – in europe his role in the british victory at the battle of lake george in  earned him a baronetcy his capture of fort niagara from the french in  brought him additional renown serving as the british superintendent of

years  marriage and family  death and legacy  in popular culture  ancestors  references  external links early life and careeredit william johnson was born around  in county meath in the kingdom of ireland he was the eldest son of christopher johnson – of smithstown co meath and anne warren daughter of michael warren of warrenstown co meath and catherine aylmer sister of admiral matthew aylmer st baron aylmer his mother anne was from an old english catholic gentry family who had in previous generations lost much of their status to protestant english colonists christopher johnson was descended from the oneill of the fews dynasty of county armagh william johnsons paternal grandfather was originally known as william macshane but changed his surname to johnson the anglicisation of the gaelic mac seáin some early biographers portrayed william johnson as living in poverty in ireland but modern studies reveal that his family lived a comfortable if modest lifestyle although the johnson family had a history of jacobitism william johnsons uncle peter warren was raised as a protestant to enable him to pursue a career in the british royal navy he achieved considerable success gaining wealth along the way admiral sir peter warren c  as a catholic william johnson had limited opportunities for advancement in the british empire never particularly religious johnson converted to protestantism when offered an opportunity to work for his uncle in british america immigration to the coloniesedit william johnson negotiating with a mohawk chief history of the city of new york  peter warren had purchased a large tract of undeveloped land along the south side of the mohawk river in the province of new york warren convinced johnson to lead an effort to establish a settlement there to be known as warrensburgh with the implied understanding that johnson would inherit much of the land johnson arrived in about  with twelve irish protestant families and began to clear the land he purchased african slaves to do the heavy labor of clearance they were the first of many slaves bought by johnson warren intended johnson to become involved in trading with american indians but johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north on the opposite side of the river from warrensburgh acting on his own initiative in  johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river where he built a store and a sawmill from this location which he called mount johnson johnson was able to cut into albanys indian trade he supplied traders with goods who were going to fort oswego and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver he dealt directly with new york city merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at albany the albany merchants were irate and warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent johnson became closely associated with the mohawk the easternmost nation of the six nations of the iroquois league by the time johnson arrived their population had collapsed to only  due to chronic infectious diseases unwittingly introduced by europeans and warfare with competing tribes related to the lucrative beaver trade the mohawk thought an alliance with johnson could advance their interests in the british imperial system sometime around  they adopted him as an honorary sachem or civil chief and gave him the name warraghiyagey which he translated as a man who undertakes great things king georges waredit in  the war of the austrian succession spread to colonial america where it was known as king georges war because of his close relationship with the mohawk in  johnson was appointed as new yorks agent to the iroquois replacing the albanybased indian commissioners the newly created colonel of the warriors of the six nations was instructed to enlist and equip colonists and indians for a campaign against the french recruiting iroquois warriors was difficult ever since the socalled grand settlement of  the iroquois had maintained a policy of neutrality in colonial wars between france and great britain working with the mohawk chief hendrick theyanoguin johnson was able to recruit mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the british johnson organised small raiding parties which were sent against the settlements of the french and their indian allies in accordance with new yorks scalp act of  johnson paid bounties for scalps although he realised this encouraged the scalping of noncombatants of all ages and both sexes in june  johnson was made colonel of the new york levies a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at albany in july  word was received of a peace settlement the mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war which lessened johnsons prestige among them for a while in  johnson built a new stone house upriver from mount johnson which became known as fort johnson the home was heavily fortified when the next war approached in  johnson shifted the primary meeting place for diplomatic councils between the british and the iroquois from albany to fort johnson he also bought houses in schenectady and albany to stop at on his business trips to new york city after king georges war johnson was caught between rival new york political factions one faction was led by governor george clinton who had appointed johnson as new yorks indian agent and in  appointed him to the governors council governor clinton urged the new york assembly to repay johnsons outstanding wartime expenses which amounted to £ repayment was blocked by clintons political rivals a faction led by lieutenant governor james de lancey who was connected to the albany indian commissioners whom johnson had supplanted de lancey was also the brotherinlaw of admiral peter warren which added to the strain in the relationship between johnson and warren an exasperated johnson resigned as new yorks indian commissioner in  when warren died in july  he left nothing to johnson in his will although warren died a very wealthy man in his will he required that johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling warrens land french and indian waredit further information great britain in the seven years war in june  hendrick theyanoguin and a delegation of mohawk travelled to new york city where they announced to governor clinton that the covenant chain—the diplomatic relationship between the british and the iroquois—was broken the british government ordered clinton to convene the albany congress of  to repair the covenant chain at the congress the mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if johnson were reinstated as their agent this mezzotint of william johnson was published in london in  johnsons reinstatement as indian agent came the following year just as the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war was escalating in  major general edward braddock sent to north america to direct the british war effort appointed johnson as his agent to the iroquois although johnson had little military experience he was commissioned as a major general and instructed to lead an expedition against the french fort at crown point his troops were provincial soldiers paid for by the colonies and not regular soldiers of the british army which meant that he had to deal with six different colonial governments while organising the expedition johnson initially had nearly  colonials at his command but general william shirley the governor of massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to fort niagara shifted some of johnsons men and resources to his own campaign tensions escalated as the two generals worked against each other in recruiting native allies the dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure as braddocks secondincommand general shirley was johnsons superior officer but when it came to indian affairs johnson was theoretically in charge in time shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on johnsons refusal to provide him with adequate indian support according to the johnson biographer milton hamilton historians usually portrayed johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with shirley but hamilton argued that johnson was reacting to shirleys clumsy indian diplomacy which harmed the british relationship with the six nations crown point expeditionedit marching north into french territory in august  johnson renamed lac du saintsacrement to lake george in honour of his king on  september  johnsons forces held their ground in the battle of lake george johnson was wounded by a ball that was to remain in his hip or thigh for the rest of his life hendrick theyanoguin johnsons mohawk ally was killed in the battle and baron dieskau the french commander was captured johnson prevented the mohawk from killing the wounded dieskau a compassionate rescue that would become famous in paintings of the event benjamin wests painting of johnson sparing baron dieskaus life after the battle of lake george the battle brought an end to the expedition against crown point and johnson built fort william henry at lake george to strengthen british defences in december tired of army life johnson resigned his commission as major general general shirley who had become the commander in chief upon braddocks death sought to have johnsons commission as indian agent modified so that johnson would be placed under his command but shirley was soon replaced both as governor and commander in chief and johnsons star was on the rise although the battle of lake george was hardly a decisive victory the british needed a military hero in a year of major setbacks and johnson became that man claims that johnson had been disabled by his wound early in the battle and thus did not participate in the victory did not reduce the recognition given to him as a reward for his services parliament voted johnson £ and king george made him a baronet never was such an insignificant encounter so generously rewarded wrote the historian julian gwyn in january  the british government made johnson sole superintendent of indian affairs for the northern colonies this position gave him great influence and power since he would report directly to the government in london and would not be controlled by provincial governments as the department was a military one of all the indian nations in the northern colonies johnson was most knowledgeable about and most closely connected to the iroquois six nations especially the mohawk as superintendent he would make the iroquois the focus of british diplomacy promoting and even exaggerating the power of the iroquois confederacy johnson also began a long process of trying to control iroquois diplomacy attempting nothing less than the refurbishment of the iroquois confederacy with himself as its centre capture of fort niagaraedit although johnson was no longer a british general he continued to lead iroquois and frontier militia in august  after the french began their siege of fort william henry johnson arrived at fort edward with  indians and  militia greatly overestimating the size of the french army british general daniel webb decided against sending a relief force from fort edward to fort william henry the british were compelled to surrender fort william henry after which many were killed in an infamous massacre stories circulated that johnson was enraged by webbs decision not to send help and that he stripped naked in front of webb to express his disgust with the war going badly for the british johnson found it difficult to enlist the support of the six nations who were not eager to join a losing cause in july  he managed to raise  warriors to take part in a massive expedition led by the new british commander general james abercrombie the campaign ended ingloriously with abercrombies disastrous attempt to take fort carillon from the french johnson and his indian auxiliaries could do little as british forces stormed the french positions in fruitless frontal assaults johnson in green is depicted in benjamin wests iconic painting the death of general wolfe although he was not present at the event in  with the capture of louisbourg fort frontenac and fort duquesne the wars momentum began to shift in favour of the british johnson was able to recruit more iroquois warriors in the summer of  he led nearly  iroquois warriors—practically the entire military strength of the six nations—as part of general john prideauxs expedition to capture fort niagara when prideaux was killed johnson took command he captured the fort after ambushing and defeating a french relief force at the battle of la bellefamille johnson is usually credited with leading or at least planning this ambush but the historian francis jennings argued that johnson was not present at the battle and that he exaggerated his role in official dispatches the conquest of niagara drove the french line back from the great lakes once more johnson was celebrated as a hero although some professional soldiers expressed doubts about his military abilities and the value of the iroquois in the victory johnson commanded the largest native american force ever assembled under the british flag johnson accompanied general jeffrey amherst in the final north american campaign of the seven years war the capture of montreal in  with the fall of new france to the british johnson and his deputy george croghan spent much time negotiating with the former indian allies of the french in  johnson made a mile  km round trip to detroit to hold a conference with the regional american indians johnson confronted the assembled chiefs about the antibritish rumours that were circulating among the natives and managed for the time being to forestall outright resistance to the british military occupation of the west normand macleod met johnson at this conference and returned with him to new york macleod was later appointed as commander of fort oswego on lake ontario postwar developmentedit after the french and indian war johnson hoped to concentrate on expanding and improving his land holdings in december  the mohawk of canajoharie gave johnson a tract of about  acres  km north of the mohawk river this grant proved to be controversial because other land speculators had already obtained licenses to purchase lands that the mohawk released for sale but sir william had not in  after years of manoeuvring and lobbying johnson finally gained royal approval for the grant this was one of several large tracts of land that johnson acquired from the mohawk and iroquois using his position as a royal indian agent by the time of his death johnson had accumulated about  acres  km and was one of the largest land owners in british america surpassed only by the penn and van rennsalaer familiescitation needed according to historian julian gwyn in all this he acted no differently from dozens of other speculators in indian lands he was distinguished only by the great advantages he possessed through his office and through his long intimacy with the indians he was indeed one of their principal exploiters in  johnson founded the city of johnstown on his grant about  miles  km west of schenectady new york north of the mohawk river he named the new settlement originally called johns town after his son john there at crown expense he established a free school for both white and mohawk children johnson hosting an iroquois conference at johnson hall in  painting by e l henry  outside the town in  he built johnson hall where he lived until his death he recruited numerous irish immigrant tenant farmers for his extensive lands and lived essentially as a feudal landlord he also purchased africanamerican slaves to work as labourers especially in his lumber operations johnson had some  slaves working for him making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province comparable to major planters of the south in  johnson organised st patricks lodge no  a freemason lodge at johnson hall and was installed as its master his nephew guy johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in  johnson was a strong supporter of the anglican church in the colony to counter the influence of french catholic missionaries in western new york in  he paid for the construction of an anglican church for the mohawk of canajoharie a village the british called the upper castle the building later used by europeanamerican congregations and known as indian castle church still stands near danube new york it is part of the mohawk upper castle historic district a national historic landmark in  johnson built st johns episcopal church in johnstown but soon complained that it was small and very ill built within five years he arranged for a larger church of stone to be constructed to accommodate the growing congregation in johnstown the historic church is still operating pontiacs war and final yearsedit in  pontiacs war resulted from native american discontent with british policy following the french and indian war for several years prior to the uprising johnson had advised general jeffrey amherst to observe iroquois diplomatic practices for instance awarding gifts to native leaders a practice they considered an important cultural symbol of respect and significant to maintaining good relations amherst who rejected johnsons advice was recalled to london and replaced by general thomas gage amhersts recall strengthened johnsons position because a policy of compromise was required with the indians and this was johnsons domain johnson negotiated a treaty with pontiac in  which finally ended the war from july to august  johnson negotiated a treaty at fort niagara with about  american indians in attendance primarily iroquois although most iroquois had stayed out of the war the seneca from the genesee river valley had taken up arms against the british and johnson worked to bring them back into the covenant chain alliance johnson convinced the iroquois to send a war party against the seneca involved in the uprising but otherwise the iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as johnson had desired johnson was a proponent of the royal proclamation of  which called for tighter imperial control and restraint of westward colonial expansion johnson negotiated the details of the boundary defined in the fort stanwix treaty of  against instructions from london johnson pushed the boundary  miles  km to the west enabling him and other land speculators to acquire much more land than originally authorised by the british government johnson was strongly criticised for exceeding his instructions but many of the land speculators were wellconnected in the government and the expanded boundary was allowed to stand native american discontent continued to grow in the west in the s johnson spent his final years attempting to prevent another uprising like pontiacs war pursuing a policy of divide and rule he worked to block the emergence of intertribal native american alliances his final success was his isolation of the shawnee before dunmores war in  marriage and familyedit in his lifetime johnson gained a reputation as a man who had numerous children with several european and native american women at the time men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children as long as they could afford it and supported them one thcentury scholar estimated that johnson had perhaps  illegitimate children but the historian francis jennings argued that there is no truth in wild stories that he slept with innumerable mohawk women in his will johnson acknowledged children by catherine weisenberg and molly brant german and mohawk respectively with whom he had longterm relationships he implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers sir john johnson nd baronet joseph brant in  shortly after arriving in america william began a relationship with catherine weisenberg c – a german electorate of the palatinate immigrant she originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant but had run away perhaps with the help of friends or relatives according to tradition she was working for another family near warrensburgh when johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper there is no record that the couple ever formally married weisenberg was johnsons commonlaw wife the couple had three children including daughters nancy and mary polly and a son john first christened under only weisenbergs name at fort hunter the senior johnson later arranged for his son john to inherit his title and estates as john johnson a grandson of sir william johnson was the rd baronet sir adam gordon johnson who was through his mother ann watts descendants of the schuyler family the delancey family and the van cortlandt family of british north america at the same time johnson had a relationship with elizabeth brant a mohawk woman by whom he had three children keghneghtago or brant born in  thomas  and christian  the latter two boys died in infancy about  johnson had a son named tagawirunta also known as william of canajoharie by a mohawk woman possibly margaret brant elizabeths younger sister johnson may have also been intimate with the sisters susannah and elizabeth wormwood and an irish woman named mary mcgrath by whom he appeared to have had a daughter named mary mary keghneghtago brant and tagawirunta william received inheritances in johnsons will in  johnson began a commonlaw relationship with molly brant a mohawk woman who moved into johnson hall and lived with johnson as his consort for the rest of his life molly was the older sister of joseph brant her younger brother joined the household when he was young johnsons relationship with molly gave him additional influence with the mohawk the couple had eight children all of whom received land from johnson in his will a grandson of william johnson and molly brant was william johnson kerr who married elizabeth brant a daughter of joseph brant and granddaughter of george croghan death and legacyedit it is mostly believed that william johnson died from a stroke at johnson hall on  july  during an indian conference guy johnson williams nephew and soninlaw he had married marypolly reported that johnson died when he was seized of a suffocation his funeral in johnstown was attended by more than  people his pallbearers included governor william franklin of new jersey and the justices of the new york supreme court he was buried beneath the altar in st johns anglican church the church he founded in johnstown the next day chiefs of the six nations performed the traditional iroquois condolence ceremony and recognised guy johnson as sir williams successor during the american revolution the rebel new york legislature seized all of johnsons lands and property as his heirs were loyalists in  johnson hall was named a national historic landmark it is a designated state historic site and open to the public johnsons most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful coexistence of angloamericans and indians during his tenure as indian agent for british north america as an adopted mohawk chief and husband according to iroquois law of mohawk mary brant he was a trusted counselor and member of mohawk nation and through that affiliation the five nations of the iroquois that position gave him standing not only to lead iroquois into battle on the side of the english but also to negotiate two treaties of fort stanwix modern day rome ny while the treaties deprived many indians of land without their knowledge they gave favourable terms to the iroquois and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional indian residents and new settlers coexistence was part of johnsons other major historical legacy the protection of british sovereignty and angloamerican settlement as a bulwark against french control of northern new york state and the great lakes region more generally johnson was instrumental in sustaining britishiroquois alliance through the covenant chain which consolidated both iroquois and british territorial and commercial interests against the rival algoonquin and french interests in new france before  after britain assumed control johnson eventually won a political dispute over indian policy with lord jeffrey amherst who disdained the iroquois alliance johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending it was to johnson that pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him old fort johnson his first home built in  is on the historic american buildings survey it is currently the home of the montgomery county historical society which operates a museum gift shop and holds events guy park manor built in  for sir williams daughter

indian affairs for the northern colonies throughout his career as a british official among the iroquois johnson combined personal business with official diplomacy acquiring tens of thousands of acres of native land and becoming very wealthy johnson commanded iroquois and colonial militia forces during the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war – in europe his role in the british victory at the battle of lake george in  earned him a baronetcy his capture of fort niagara from the french in  brought him additional renown serving as the british superintendent of

years  marriage and family  death and legacy  in popular culture  ancestors  references  external links early life and careeredit william johnson was born around  in county meath in the kingdom of ireland he was the eldest son of christopher johnson – of smithstown co meath and anne warren daughter of michael warren of warrenstown co meath and catherine aylmer sister of admiral matthew aylmer st baron aylmer his mother anne was from an old english catholic gentry family who had in previous generations lost much of their status to protestant english colonists christopher johnson was descended from the oneill of the fews dynasty of county armagh william johnsons paternal grandfather was originally known as william macshane but changed his surname to johnson the anglicisation of the gaelic mac seáin some early biographers portrayed william johnson as living in poverty in ireland but modern studies reveal that his family lived a comfortable if modest lifestyle although the johnson family had a history of jacobitism william johnsons uncle peter warren was raised as a protestant to enable him to pursue a career in the british royal navy he achieved considerable success gaining wealth along the way admiral sir peter warren c  as a catholic william johnson had limited opportunities for advancement in the british empire never particularly religious johnson converted to protestantism when offered an opportunity to work for his uncle in british america immigration to the coloniesedit william johnson negotiating with a mohawk chief history of the city of new york  peter warren had purchased a large tract of undeveloped land along the south side of the mohawk river in the province of new york warren convinced johnson to lead an effort to establish a settlement there to be known as warrensburgh with the implied understanding that johnson would inherit much of the land johnson arrived in about  with twelve irish protestant families and began to clear the land he purchased african slaves to do the heavy labor of clearance they were the first of many slaves bought by johnson warren intended johnson to become involved in trading with american indians but johnson soon discovered that the trade routes were to the north on the opposite side of the river from warrensburgh acting on his own initiative in  johnson bought a house and small farm on the north side of the river where he built a store and a sawmill from this location which he called mount johnson johnson was able to cut into albanys indian trade he supplied traders with goods who were going to fort oswego and he bought furs from them when they returned downriver he dealt directly with new york city merchants and cut out the previous middlemen at albany the albany merchants were irate and warren was not pleased that his nephew was becoming independent johnson became closely associated with the mohawk the easternmost nation of the six nations of the iroquois league by the time johnson arrived their population had collapsed to only  due to chronic infectious diseases unwittingly introduced by europeans and warfare with competing tribes related to the lucrative beaver trade the mohawk thought an alliance with johnson could advance their interests in the british imperial system sometime around  they adopted him as an honorary sachem or civil chief and gave him the name warraghiyagey which he translated as a man who undertakes great things king georges waredit in  the war of the austrian succession spread to colonial america where it was known as king georges war because of his close relationship with the mohawk in  johnson was appointed as new yorks agent to the iroquois replacing the albanybased indian commissioners the newly created colonel of the warriors of the six nations was instructed to enlist and equip colonists and indians for a campaign against the french recruiting iroquois warriors was difficult ever since the socalled grand settlement of  the iroquois had maintained a policy of neutrality in colonial wars between france and great britain working with the mohawk chief hendrick theyanoguin johnson was able to recruit mohawk warriors to fight on the side of the british johnson organised small raiding parties which were sent against the settlements of the french and their indian allies in accordance with new yorks scalp act of  johnson paid bounties for scalps although he realised this encouraged the scalping of noncombatants of all ages and both sexes in june  johnson was made colonel of the new york levies a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at albany in july  word was received of a peace settlement the mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war which lessened johnsons prestige among them for a while in  johnson built a new stone house upriver from mount johnson which became known as fort johnson the home was heavily fortified when the next war approached in  johnson shifted the primary meeting place for diplomatic councils between the british and the iroquois from albany to fort johnson he also bought houses in schenectady and albany to stop at on his business trips to new york city after king georges war johnson was caught between rival new york political factions one faction was led by governor george clinton who had appointed johnson as new yorks indian agent and in  appointed him to the governors council governor clinton urged the new york assembly to repay johnsons outstanding wartime expenses which amounted to £ repayment was blocked by clintons political rivals a faction led by lieutenant governor james de lancey who was connected to the albany indian commissioners whom johnson had supplanted de lancey was also the brotherinlaw of admiral peter warren which added to the strain in the relationship between johnson and warren an exasperated johnson resigned as new yorks indian commissioner in  when warren died in july  he left nothing to johnson in his will although warren died a very wealthy man in his will he required that johnson repay the expenses incurred while settling warrens land french and indian waredit further information great britain in the seven years war in june  hendrick theyanoguin and a delegation of mohawk travelled to new york city where they announced to governor clinton that the covenant chain—the diplomatic relationship between the british and the iroquois—was broken the british government ordered clinton to convene the albany congress of  to repair the covenant chain at the congress the mohawk insisted that the alliance would be restored only if johnson were reinstated as their agent this mezzotint of william johnson was published in london in  johnsons reinstatement as indian agent came the following year just as the french and indian war the north american theatre of the seven years war was escalating in  major general edward braddock sent to north america to direct the british war effort appointed johnson as his agent to the iroquois although johnson had little military experience he was commissioned as a major general and instructed to lead an expedition against the french fort at crown point his troops were provincial soldiers paid for by the colonies and not regular soldiers of the british army which meant that he had to deal with six different colonial governments while organising the expedition johnson initially had nearly  colonials at his command but general william shirley the governor of massachusetts who had been commissioned to lead a simultaneous expedition to fort niagara shifted some of johnsons men and resources to his own campaign tensions escalated as the two generals worked against each other in recruiting native allies the dispute was complicated by the unusual command structure as braddocks secondincommand general shirley was johnsons superior officer but when it came to indian affairs johnson was theoretically in charge in time shirley would blame the failure of his expedition on johnsons refusal to provide him with adequate indian support according to the johnson biographer milton hamilton historians usually portrayed johnson as acting unreasonably in the controversy with shirley but hamilton argued that johnson was reacting to shirleys clumsy indian diplomacy which harmed the british relationship with the six nations crown point expeditionedit marching north into french territory in august  johnson renamed lac du saintsacrement to lake george in honour of his king on  september  johnsons forces held their ground in the battle of lake george johnson was wounded by a ball that was to remain in his hip or thigh for the rest of his life hendrick theyanoguin johnsons mohawk ally was killed in the battle and baron dieskau the french commander was captured johnson prevented the mohawk from killing the wounded dieskau a compassionate rescue that would become famous in paintings of the event benjamin wests painting of johnson sparing baron dieskaus life after the battle of lake george the battle brought an end to the expedition against crown point and johnson built fort william henry at lake george to strengthen british defences in december tired of army life johnson resigned his commission as major general general shirley who had become the commander in chief upon braddocks death sought to have johnsons commission as indian agent modified so that johnson would be placed under his command but shirley was soon replaced both as governor and commander in chief and johnsons star was on the rise although the battle of lake george was hardly a decisive victory the british needed a military hero in a year of major setbacks and johnson became that man claims that johnson had been disabled by his wound early in the battle and thus did not participate in the victory did not reduce the recognition given to him as a reward for his services parliament voted johnson £ and king george made him a baronet never was such an insignificant encounter so generously rewarded wrote the historian julian gwyn in january  the british government made johnson sole superintendent of indian affairs for the northern colonies this position gave him great influence and power since he would report directly to the government in london and would not be controlled by provincial governments as the department was a military one of all the indian nations in the northern colonies johnson was most knowledgeable about and most closely connected to the iroquois six nations especially the mohawk as superintendent he would make the iroquois the focus of british diplomacy promoting and even exaggerating the power of the iroquois confederacy johnson also began a long process of trying to control iroquois diplomacy attempting nothing less than the refurbishment of the iroquois confederacy with himself as its centre capture of fort niagaraedit although johnson was no longer a british general he continued to lead iroquois and frontier militia in august  after the french began their siege of fort william henry johnson arrived at fort edward with  indians and  militia greatly overestimating the size of the french army british general daniel webb decided against sending a relief force from fort edward to fort william henry the british were compelled to surrender fort william henry after which many were killed in an infamous massacre stories circulated that johnson was enraged by webbs decision not to send help and that he stripped naked in front of webb to express his disgust with the war going badly for the british johnson found it difficult to enlist the support of the six nations who were not eager to join a losing cause in july  he managed to raise  warriors to take part in a massive expedition led by the new british commander general james abercrombie the campaign ended ingloriously with abercrombies disastrous attempt to take fort carillon from the french johnson and his indian auxiliaries could do little as british forces stormed the french positions in fruitless frontal assaults johnson in green is depicted in benjamin wests iconic painting the death of general wolfe although he was not present at the event in  with the capture of louisbourg fort frontenac and fort duquesne the wars momentum began to shift in favour of the british johnson was able to recruit more iroquois warriors in the summer of  he led nearly  iroquois warriors—practically the entire military strength of the six nations—as part of general john prideauxs expedition to capture fort niagara when prideaux was killed johnson took command he captured the fort after ambushing and defeating a french relief force at the battle of la bellefamille johnson is usually credited with leading or at least planning this ambush but the historian francis jennings argued that johnson was not present at the battle and that he exaggerated his role in official dispatches the conquest of niagara drove the french line back from the great lakes once more johnson was celebrated as a hero although some professional soldiers expressed doubts about his military abilities and the value of the iroquois in the victory johnson commanded the largest native american force ever assembled under the british flag johnson accompanied general jeffrey amherst in the final north american campaign of the seven years war the capture of montreal in  with the fall of new france to the british johnson and his deputy george croghan spent much time negotiating with the former indian allies of the french in  johnson made a mile  km round trip to detroit to hold a conference with the regional american indians johnson confronted the assembled chiefs about the antibritish rumours that were circulating among the natives and managed for the time being to forestall outright resistance to the british military occupation of the west normand macleod met johnson at this conference and returned with him to new york macleod was later appointed as commander of fort oswego on lake ontario postwar developmentedit after the french and indian war johnson hoped to concentrate on expanding and improving his land holdings in december  the mohawk of canajoharie gave johnson a tract of about  acres  km north of the mohawk river this grant proved to be controversial because other land speculators had already obtained licenses to purchase lands that the mohawk released for sale but sir william had not in  after years of manoeuvring and lobbying johnson finally gained royal approval for the grant this was one of several large tracts of land that johnson acquired from the mohawk and iroquois using his position as a royal indian agent by the time of his death johnson had accumulated about  acres  km and was one of the largest land owners in british america surpassed only by the penn and van rennsalaer familiescitation needed according to historian julian gwyn in all this he acted no differently from dozens of other speculators in indian lands he was distinguished only by the great advantages he possessed through his office and through his long intimacy with the indians he was indeed one of their principal exploiters in  johnson founded the city of johnstown on his grant about  miles  km west of schenectady new york north of the mohawk river he named the new settlement originally called johns town after his son john there at crown expense he established a free school for both white and mohawk children johnson hosting an iroquois conference at johnson hall in  painting by e l henry  outside the town in  he built johnson hall where he lived until his death he recruited numerous irish immigrant tenant farmers for his extensive lands and lived essentially as a feudal landlord he also purchased africanamerican slaves to work as labourers especially in his lumber operations johnson had some  slaves working for him making him the largest slaveholder in the county and likely in the province comparable to major planters of the south in  johnson organised st patricks lodge no  a freemason lodge at johnson hall and was installed as its master his nephew guy johnson succeeded him as master of this lodge in  johnson was a strong supporter of the anglican church in the colony to counter the influence of french catholic missionaries in western new york in  he paid for the construction of an anglican church for the mohawk of canajoharie a village the british called the upper castle the building later used by europeanamerican congregations and known as indian castle church still stands near danube new york it is part of the mohawk upper castle historic district a national historic landmark in  johnson built st johns episcopal church in johnstown but soon complained that it was small and very ill built within five years he arranged for a larger church of stone to be constructed to accommodate the growing congregation in johnstown the historic church is still operating pontiacs war and final yearsedit in  pontiacs war resulted from native american discontent with british policy following the french and indian war for several years prior to the uprising johnson had advised general jeffrey amherst to observe iroquois diplomatic practices for instance awarding gifts to native leaders a practice they considered an important cultural symbol of respect and significant to maintaining good relations amherst who rejected johnsons advice was recalled to london and replaced by general thomas gage amhersts recall strengthened johnsons position because a policy of compromise was required with the indians and this was johnsons domain johnson negotiated a treaty with pontiac in  which finally ended the war from july to august  johnson negotiated a treaty at fort niagara with about  american indians in attendance primarily iroquois although most iroquois had stayed out of the war the seneca from the genesee river valley had taken up arms against the british and johnson worked to bring them back into the covenant chain alliance johnson convinced the iroquois to send a war party against the seneca involved in the uprising but otherwise the iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as johnson had desired johnson was a proponent of the royal proclamation of  which called for tighter imperial control and restraint of westward colonial expansion johnson negotiated the details of the boundary defined in the fort stanwix treaty of  against instructions from london johnson pushed the boundary  miles  km to the west enabling him and other land speculators to acquire much more land than originally authorised by the british government johnson was strongly criticised for exceeding his instructions but many of the land speculators were wellconnected in the government and the expanded boundary was allowed to stand native american discontent continued to grow in the west in the s johnson spent his final years attempting to prevent another uprising like pontiacs war pursuing a policy of divide and rule he worked to block the emergence of intertribal native american alliances his final success was his isolation of the shawnee before dunmores war in  marriage and familyedit in his lifetime johnson gained a reputation as a man who had numerous children with several european and native american women at the time men were not ostracised for having illegitimate children as long as they could afford it and supported them one thcentury scholar estimated that johnson had perhaps  illegitimate children but the historian francis jennings argued that there is no truth in wild stories that he slept with innumerable mohawk women in his will johnson acknowledged children by catherine weisenberg and molly brant german and mohawk respectively with whom he had longterm relationships he implicitly acknowledged several other children by unnamed mothers sir john johnson nd baronet joseph brant in  shortly after arriving in america william began a relationship with catherine weisenberg c – a german electorate of the palatinate immigrant she originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant but had run away perhaps with the help of friends or relatives according to tradition she was working for another family near warrensburgh when johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper there is no record that the couple ever formally married weisenberg was johnsons commonlaw wife the couple had three children including daughters nancy and mary polly and a son john first christened under only weisenbergs name at fort hunter the senior johnson later arranged for his son john to inherit his title and estates as john johnson a grandson of sir william johnson was the rd baronet sir adam gordon johnson who was through his mother ann watts descendants of the schuyler family the delancey family and the van cortlandt family of british north america at the same time johnson had a relationship with elizabeth brant a mohawk woman by whom he had three children keghneghtago or brant born in  thomas  and christian  the latter two boys died in infancy about  johnson had a son named tagawirunta also known as william of canajoharie by a mohawk woman possibly margaret brant elizabeths younger sister johnson may have also been intimate with the sisters susannah and elizabeth wormwood and an irish woman named mary mcgrath by whom he appeared to have had a daughter named mary mary keghneghtago brant and tagawirunta william received inheritances in johnsons will in  johnson began a commonlaw relationship with molly brant a mohawk woman who moved into johnson hall and lived with johnson as his consort for the rest of his life molly was the older sister of joseph brant her younger brother joined the household when he was young johnsons relationship with molly gave him additional influence with the mohawk the couple had eight children all of whom received land from johnson in his will a grandson of william johnson and molly brant was william johnson kerr who married elizabeth brant a daughter of joseph brant and granddaughter of george croghan death and legacyedit it is mostly believed that william johnson died from a stroke at johnson hall on  july  during an indian conference guy johnson williams nephew and soninlaw he had married marypolly reported that johnson died when he was seized of a suffocation his funeral in johnstown was attended by more than  people his pallbearers included governor william franklin of new jersey and the justices of the new york supreme court he was buried beneath the altar in st johns anglican church the church he founded in johnstown the next day chiefs of the six nations performed the traditional iroquois condolence ceremony and recognised guy johnson as sir williams successor during the american revolution the rebel new york legislature seized all of johnsons lands and property as his heirs were loyalists in  johnson hall was named a national historic landmark it is a designated state historic site and open to the public johnsons most important legacy is the comparatively peaceful coexistence of angloamericans and indians during his tenure as indian agent for british north america as an adopted mohawk chief and husband according to iroquois law of mohawk mary brant he was a trusted counselor and member of mohawk nation and through that affiliation the five nations of the iroquois that position gave him standing not only to lead iroquois into battle on the side of the english but also to negotiate two treaties of fort stanwix modern day rome ny while the treaties deprived many indians of land without their knowledge they gave favourable terms to the iroquois and resulted in decades of comparative peace between traditional indian residents and new settlers coexistence was part of johnsons other major historical legacy the protection of british sovereignty and angloamerican settlement as a bulwark against french control of northern new york state and the great lakes region more generally johnson was instrumental in sustaining britishiroquois alliance through the covenant chain which consolidated both iroquois and british territorial and commercial interests against the rival algoonquin and french interests in new france before  after britain assumed control johnson eventually won a political dispute over indian policy with lord jeffrey amherst who disdained the iroquois alliance johnson had so devoted himself to nurturing and defending it was to johnson that pontiac finally surrendered after the eventual failure of the rebellion named for him old fort johnson his first home built in  is on the historic american buildings survey it is currently the home of the montgomery county historical society which operates a museum gift shop and holds events guy park manor built in  for sir williams daughter
