richard hickey on apr 9  in news   comments industry champions profile liam griffin industry champions profile – liam griffin liam griffin is md of the griffin group a business he runs with his two sons he has spent all his life in the tourism and hospitality business since being involved in his family’s guesthouse in rosslare from an early age he spent time abroad working in the hospitality trade and he also worked for a period on his return to ireland with bord failte while tourism is in his blood hurling has been his passion he is also known as the last man to manage wexford to an allireland senior hurling title in 99 his  star monart destination spa in enniscorthy opened in  and was recently voted as the second best spa in the world that is some achievement for liam and his team and speaks volumes for the ethos he adopts to his business “provide the best in class products with unbeatable service standards” liam is the industry champion for tourism for the south east apj and we asked him to give us his thoughts on his involvement so far   why did you get involved i had seen the decimation of rural ireland and gaa clubs in particular brought about by the recession kids that i had coached at a young age were leaving for australia and elsewhere so it was a huge issue and it affected a lot of families when i was asked to be involved i thought straight away that i would because i was very conscious of the issues involved with this being called the ‘action plan for jobs’ anything that could create jobs in the region would be pushing an open door for me what do you think is the key challenge we’ve never been united before as a region in the south east there is a disconnect between a lot of the counties to start with kilkenny wexford and carlow are in leinster and tipperary and waterford are in munster and that creates its own sense of division also the land connection between wexford and waterford is a single narrow bridge in new ross i think with waterford being the regional capital and a lot of the regional centres and authorities going there you even had a sense that certain parts of the region were marginalised by regionalisation and we are used to competing with each other through our hurling rivalries there’s always been a sense of the region being disconnected so the key challenge is uniting a region that hasn’t always acted together or felt united have there been any achievements so far the coming together of the county councils around the greenway project is a good force that can maximise the strength of the region we have found common ground rather than competing ground around a project that can do so much for the region if you think of all of the benefits that a linked greenwayblueway route will bring in terms of counteracting rural decimation connecting the entire country and creating jobs in rural areas before we might have looked at these greenway projects parochially and we might have even competed against each other regarding them but now we are working towards a plan and we are connected and i think all the regional stakeholders will see the benefit of that you’re excited about the greenway project overall it could do wonders in terms of tourism and it also will attract a better type of tourism and a more sustainable tourism the tourism product it will create will be very difficult to replicate anywhere in the world when you think that we could link from rosslare to donegal and it’s in our hands to do so given the amount of land that is in state ownership we have great weather in the region in comparison to other regions in the country and that is a selling point as well it has huge potential and it can create jobs in non hightech sectors as well which is important to do so it’s very exciting and there are so many opportunities that can spring up around it what can we learn from the approach taken to the greenwayblueway project if we can think collaboratively across all of the actions in the plan we will be in a strong position we can leave our competition to the sports field and come together when it comes to job creation the greenwayblueway projects have been a great starting point to unite the region and we need to carry that across the entire action plan now finally as industry champion for tourism are you concerned about brexit there will obviously be both opportunities and challenges with brexit but it is still early days you’d be hoping the uk might still row back on it the exchange rate will be vital because we actually received a huge benefit from the devaluation of the euro around the time of the recession because it made it cheaper to travel here but in terms of what we need to do ourselves it’s really building quality tourism products like we are with the greenway so that we can attract a better quality tourism into the region and also from markets other than the uk if we can do that we can protect ourselves from whatever happens with brexit     the seapj would like to keep you informed of our activity please subscribe to our mailing list news second apj progress report h  published by the djei industry champions profile liam
