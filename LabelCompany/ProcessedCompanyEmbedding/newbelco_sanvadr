search ab inbev bud nears closing mega merger with sabmiller august    pm edt by zacks equity research zackscom shutterstock photo the worlds two largest brewers anheuserbusch inbev sanv bud  alias ab inbev and sabmiller plc sbmry are on track with their megamerger deal having cleared the regulatory hurdles in the european union south africa the us and china the companies have come up with a timetable for the series of events before finally closing the merger transaction on oct   the timetable set out for approaching the mega combination includes the publication of merger terms on aug  the uk scheme directions hearing on aug  publication of other key transaction documents on aug  shareholder meetings of ab inbev sabmiller and newbelco as well as uk  scheme court meeting on sep  uk scheme court sanction hearing and last day of dealings in sabmiller shares on oct  and the closure of the deal on oct  now a major hurdle in the progress of the deal is the uk court hearing uk scheme directions hearing on aug  which will ponder on sabmillers proposal to divide its shareholders in two classes and have each class vote separately for the deal with this proposal sabmiller intends to divide its largest shareholders altria group inc mo and bevco which together hold  of sabmillers stakes into a separate class last week sabmillers board of directors accepted the budweiser owners revised and final offer of gbp  per share up from gbp  per share with the condition that the formers shareholders will be divided into two classes accordingly ab inbev put forward two variants of its offer  one the alreadystated gbp  per share for majority shareholders and two a cashandshares offer for the companys largest shareholders this brings a disparity in the both the offers as the cashandshares bid has a higher value than the cash offer even though the newlyissued shares have an expiry date of five years though the shareholder votes on the deal are scheduled for sep  sabmillers largest shareholders have already expressed their support for the deal ab inbev and sabmiller had reached an agreement to create the first truly global beer company back in oct  the combined entity is likely to control about onethirds of the global beer market leaving behind heineken nv heiny  ever since the announcement the companies have worked together in clearing the regulatory hurdles around the world making an integration plan and executing ab inbevs bond financing program we believe that this collaboration is likely to benefit both the companies by bringing their individual solid brand portfolios and innovative teams together also their robust geographical reach would enable the combined giant to serve all major beer markets that have sturdy growth potential with the combination of ab inbevs budweiser stella artois and corona with sabmillers castle lager the merged company will be well positioned to grab every opportunity in the fastgrowing african and new latin american markets thus this combined firm with a stronger network and enhanced brand structure would boost shareholder value and cater to consumers of both entities by offering them a wider assortment anheuserbu adr
