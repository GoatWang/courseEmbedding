the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys uses a variation of herf to measure the diversity of loan sizes where a higher number represents greater diversity loan concentration has

rating action moodys assigns definitive ratings to  cmbs classes of cfcre c mortgage trust global credit research   feb  approximately  million of structured securities affected new york february

assigned aaa sf cl asb definitive rating assigned aaa sf cl a definitive rating assigned aaa sf cl a definitive rating assigned aaa sf cl am definitive rating assigned aa sf cl b definitive rating assigned a sf ratings rationale the certificates are collateralized by  fixed rate loans secured by  properties moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio subsequent to the publication of the provisional ratings on january th  moodys revised its analysis for the  townsend loan  of pool balance as one occupant representing  of the base rent announced that they were terminating operations in the united states the moodys ltv ratio for the  townsend loan changed from  to  the resulting moodys ltv ratio for the pool increased from  to which is higher than the  transaction average of  but slightly lower than  conduit transaction average of  the moodys actual dscr of x is higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of x is in par with the  conduitfusion transaction average of x with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level herfindahl score of  is lower than the  average of  considering loans made to a common sponsor the pools borrower level herfindahl score is  as two loans  of the pool balance have a sponsor in common with one or more loans in the pool borrowersponsor concentrations among multiple loans increase asset correlations which affect pool default and loss distributions with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl score is  the pool contains nine loans  of the pool balance that are secured by multiple properties loans secured by multiple properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility given that excess cash flow from one property can be used to augment anothers cash flow to meet debt service requirements these loans also benefit from the pooling of equity from each underlying property moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is  which is in line with the indices calculated in most multiborrower transactions since  typical moodys rated conduit pools exhibit an average grade between  and  this deal has a supersenior aaa classes with  credit enhancement although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against pool loss the supersenior structure is credit negative for the carved out class am certificate that supports the supersenior class if the support certificate were to take a loss the loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition that their lossgiven default is higher this adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across deals given the composition of the subject pool moodys is unable to assign a aaa sf rating to the support certificate of class am the principal methodology used in these ratings was approach to rating us and canadian conduitfusion cmbs published in december  please see the ratings methodologies page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys review used the excelbased cmbs conduit model which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions credit enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type moodys actual and stressed dscr and moodys property quality grade which reflects the capitalization rate moodys uses to estimate moodys value moodys fuses the conduit results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents  or greater of the current pool balance moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated aaa sf super senior class would be aaa aa and a respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys b must

contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring for ratings issued on a program series or categoryclass of debt this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation to each
