commerce between a business and an individual consumer while it applies to any type of directtoconsumer selling it has come to be associated with online selling also known as ecommerce or etailing ecommerce took off significantly in the late s with the  holiday shopping season identified as the first “etail christmas” that year amazon surpassed more than  billion in sales for the first time in recent years the growth in businesstoconsumer online sales has created significant challenges for traditional “brickandmortar” businesses and services that are losing inperson sales to online competitors as a result many brickandmortar businesses are establishing their own online presence to stay competitive this has created opportunities for consumers who can now enjoy the convenience of online ordering while saving on shipping expenses with certain retailers by picking up or returning orders to the online retailer’s brickandmortar stores businesstoconsumer sales models in online businesstoconsumer sales there are generally five business models  direct sellers this is the type most people are familiar with – they are the online retail sites where consumers buy products they can be manufacturers such as gap or dell or small businesses that create and sell products but they can also be online versions of department stores selling products from a wide range of brands and manufacturers examples include targetcom macyscom and zapposcom  online intermediaries these “gobetweens” put buyers and sellers together without owning the product or service examples include online travel sites such as expedia and trivago and arts and crafts retailer etsy  advertisingbased this approach leverages high volumes of web traffic to sell advertising which in turn sells products or services to the consumer this model uses highquality free content to attract site visitors who then encounter online ads media outlets that have no paid subscription component such as the huffington post and observercom are examples  communitybased this model uses online communities built around shared interests to help advertisers market their products directly to site users it could be an online forum for photography buffs people with diabetes or marching band members the bestknown example is facebook which helps marketers target ads to people according to very specific demographics  feebased these directtoconsumer sites charge a subscription fee for access to their content they typically include publications that offer a limited amount of content for free but charge for most of it – such as the wall street journal – or entertainment services such as netflix or hulu businesses selling directly to consumers should take into account how their target customers like to shop and buy products like theirs as they explore various businesstoconsumer options whether those possibilities involve inperson or online transactions   tweet leave a reply cancel reply your email address

accounting policies   the company   mon space net inc the “company” was incorporated in the state of nevada on december   the company plans to offer an online marketplace to sell products and services using a business to business to consumer model the company’s operations to date have been limited to offering shares of common stock to investors   on march   the company incorporated msni m sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia as a wholly owned subsidiary   basis of presentation   the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in all material respects   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary msni m sdn bhd intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions balances held by the company are not typically in excess of fdic insured limits at march   all of the company’s cash was deposited in one bank   loss per common share   loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the

evaluated all transactions through the financial statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration            note  – going concern   the company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of  for the three months ended march   the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to execute its operation plan to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources as may be required there can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to our company we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing for up to  months   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   we are attempting to generate sufficient revenue however our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of our company to continue as a going

analysis of financial condition and results of operations   overview   we were incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of nevada mon space net inc “mon space” plans to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services to its members using a business to business to consumer model bbc with respect to our business we plan to build an online platform that allows the users to be “merchants” as well as “shoppers” at the same time through the features products and services offered in our platform the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and encourage them to promote and advertise their products on our platform in the meantime the users could purchase products and services from other users who sell such products and services at a discounted price our platform is also designed and built to encourage users to return and refer new users it is the company’s objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant users on our platform can offer their products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels and so that our shopper users will choose our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services despite of our plan we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal    in february  we completed a regulation s offering in which we sold  shares of common stock to thirtyseven  investors at a purchase price of  per share for aggregate offering proceeds of     plan of operations   our goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to obtain new members and merchandisers    in april  we acquired the company monspacemall sdn bhd “msb” which owned and operated an ecommerce platform called “monspacemallcom” msb was incorporated less than one year but the ecommerce platform started commercialisation in q  we shall inject more database of consumers into this platform to build the user base   in the next three months thereafter we plan to expand our merchants and product base and increase membership through aggressive referral campaigns by the thenexisting members we also plan to set up warehouse and logistic systems for orders distribution and packaging as well as to hire necessary warehouse and logistic staff   during the third quarter it is our goal to create our own brand merchandises for items such as apparel gift products and other promotional items we plan to achieve this by hiring internal design staff for our own products   by the end of the next fiscal year it is our goal to set up offices in countries such as china indonesia vietnam and thailand for sourcing more merchants we also plan to engage in marketing activities in various local markets to bring in more awareness of our online platform our goal is to obtain as many members as possible so that we can use our members’ collective bargaining power to negotiate the lowest price with the merchants for their products    if we are unable to build a sustainable customer base through our marketing channels we will cease our development andor marketing operations until we raise money attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the otcqb for which there is no assurance if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans   results of operations   we generated no revenue for the three months ended march   and march   and the following summarizes our operating expenses and net loss for all periods presented below the company’s operations to date have been limited to offering shares of common stock to investors            the table below sets forth line items from the company’s unaudited consolidated statements of operations       three months ended                   march            percentage                 inc dec     inc dec   operating expenses                         general and administrative                         total operating expenses                                                              loss from operations                                                              other expenses                                                             net loss                         three months ended march   compared with three months ended march     general and administrative   the consolidated general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase was attributable to the inclusion of the subsidiaryincurred secretarial printing and stationery fees as well as increase in filing fees   other expenses   the consolidated other expenses increased  or  to  for the three months ended march   from nil for the three months ended march   the increase was attributable to foreign currency transactions carried out by the wholly owned subsidiary msni m sdn bhd   net loss net loss increased by  or  to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   the increase in net loss was driven by an increase of  in total general and administrative expenses and an increase of  in other expenses   liquidity and capital resources   as of march   we had a cash balance of  during the first three months ended march   we had no cash inflows and operations used  in cash we can provide no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months   we have nominal assets and have generated no revenues since inception we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures we may be required to raise additional funds particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing for up to  months in addition our company may from time to time receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties however as of the date of this form  such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support our business nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties other than working capital we presently have no other alternative source of working capital we may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations we may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we do not anticipate we will be profitable in  therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities obtaining credit facilities or other financing mechanisms however a downturn in the us equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing furthermore if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock the inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations if we are unable to obtain additional financing we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations            we anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future therefore our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly   going concern   we have not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of  for the three months ended march   our continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to execute our operating plan to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources as may be required there can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to our company we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing for up to  months   the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to do so the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the we were unable to continue as a going concern   we are attempting to generate sufficient revenue however our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of us to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability to raise additional funds   significant and critical accounting policies and practices   while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our consolidated financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary msni m sdn bhd intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions balances held by the company are not typically in excess of fdic insured limits at march   all of the company’s cash was deposited in one bank   foreign currency   the company has determined that the functional currency of the company is us dollars foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in the statement of operations as other income expense            use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   recent accounting pronouncements   from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed we believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   contractual obligations   we do not have any contractual obligations at this time   off balance sheet arrangement   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangement     item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable because we are a smaller reporting company    item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   pursuant to rule ab under the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” the company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the company’s management including the company’s chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” the company’s principal financial and accounting officer of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined under rule ae under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation the company’s ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of march   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that the company files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including the company’s ceo and cfo as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure for the reason described below   because of our limited operations we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties in addition we lack a formal audit committee with a financial expert as we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts as needed however there can be no assurance that our operations will expand     changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our

which we sold  shares of common stock to thirtyseven  investors at a purchase price of  per share for an aggregate offering price of     implications of being an emerging growth company   we qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the jobs act an emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies these provisions include   ● a requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related mda        ● exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act of         ● reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company’s executive compensation arrangements and           ● no nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements   we have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this prospectus which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act”   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act of  as amended the “securities act” for complying with new or revised accounting standards we have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   we could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period             our business   online platform   we plan to launch “mon space mall” an online platform that would allow thirdparty merchants as well as individual users to sell their general merchandise products and services directly to other users on our platform we plan to charge the sellers a service fee of approximately  of the total purchase price with respect to their general merchandise sold through our website we also plan to generate revenue through from thirdparty merchants if they advertise products through our website thirdparty merchants use our website to advertise and sell their goods manage customer data and track orders and shipments consumers shop online and pay for products and services through the system thus we do not buy hold or sell any inventory in addition as we begin to accumulate a large base of membership for our website we plan to negotiate with merchandisers and source quality products at a discount not available anywhere else for our users   any user could register to become a member for an annual fee which will provide our members with exclusive discounts and benefits we expect our website to provide retail as well as a potential wholesale channel to manufacturers and distributors who wish to sell directly to consumers our platform will eliminate most intermediate links and results in substantial channel cost savings by providing direct access to our members merchants attain an immediate and dramatic expansion of their retail exposure throughout the world merchants benefit from the online nature of businesstoconsumer ecommerce transactions that facilitate fast and immediate receipt of orders shorten accounts receivable periods enhance cash flow reduce cost of sales and increase a seller’s operational capacity    while our website is still under construction we plan to provide consumer goods and services in the following major categories         clothing and shoes       nutrition and health supplements       cosmetics and beauty       jewelry and accessories       office supplies       household items       luxury products       kitchen appliances       cultural decorations     toys and games     consumer electronics     home furnishings   recent development   on march   we incorporated msni m sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia “msni malaysia” as a whollyowned subsidiary of our company msni malaysia entered into a collaboration agreement the “collaboration agreement” with monspacemall sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia “monspacemall” on april   pursuant to the collaboration agreement msni malaysia agreed to conduct its business jointly with monspacemall under the name of “monspacemallcom” as part of the collaboration msni malaysia has agreed to contribute to the business an initial consumer database of up to  members whereas monspacemall has agreed to provide services in connection with the management and operation of the ecommerce engine with domain name “monspacemallcom” in consideration of its respective contribution to the collaboration msni malaysia and monspacemall will each receive  of the profit generated from monspacemallcom   on april   we entered into an acquisition agreement with the shareholders of monspacemall pursuant to which we agreed to purchase  equity interest or  ordinary shares of monspacemall for an aggregate purchase price of us the consummation of the acquisition is subject to the completion of the audit for monspacemall             competition   we compete against both domestic and international ecommerce businesses as well as traditional retailers that are expanding into ecommerce we believe our major competitors include among others amazon ebay and alibaba   we believe our ecommerce business model possesses a number of strategically significant strengths for example our platform will contain businesstoconsumer ecommerce with full range of consumer goods and services from clothing and consumer electronics to household appliances and home furnishings for sellers the platform provides comprehensive retail channel benefits and geographical breadth while permitting autonomy and flexibility in how sellers fulfill and ship goods to consumers by concentrating on ecommerce technology we help sellers avoid the overhead and operational difficulties of logistics and supply chains   our website is presently disadvantaged by its limited history in the marketplace and our need to recruit and train experienced personnel in addition to the competition we face from other ecommerce businesses we require time and resources to further integrate our banking merchant and consumer partners   marketing strategy   our marketing efforts are comprised primarily of online social media and word of mouth advertising geared toward building brand recognition and brand differentiation  we also plan to provide existing members with referral bonus for each new member that they sign up in addition we plan to incentivize existing members to refer new members by rewarding additional bonus for each sale or purchase that the new member makes once we establish a large base of membership we believe we will have sufficient bargaining strength to negotiate with merchandisers to provide deep discounts on our platform to attract more members we aim to build ourselves to be a leader in the ecommerce market and attempt to reinforce on a consistent basis that it should be a destination of choice for merchandisers and consumers worldwide   government regulation   in connection with the operation of our business we are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those related to     ● nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements         ● management and protection of the personal data of our employees and customers         ●    sales tax and         ● various federal state and local laws relating to among other things business health food safety codes   these laws and regulations are complex which complicates monitoring and compliance as a result regulatory risks are inherent in our operations we may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance with these laws and regulations in the future our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in litigation fines penalties judgments or other sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation     employees   we presently have no employees apart from our officers and directors   seasonality   we do not have a seasonal business cycle   environmental matters   our business currently does not implicate any environmental regulation   intellectual property   we do not hold any patents trademarks or other registered intellectual property on products relating to our business however in addition to our domain name from time to time we may apply for patents trademarks or other registered intellectual property essential to the protection of our brand and success of our business   domain names   as of the date of this annual report we plan to register a domain that would be suitable for our business and easy for our potential members to remember            item a risk factors   risks related to our business   limited operating history   mon space was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on december   as of the date of this form k we have had limited operations upon which an evaluation of our company and its prospects could be based there can be no assurance that our management will be successful in completing the our business development plans implementing the corporate infrastructure to support operations at the levels called for by our business plan devise a marketing plan to successfully reach customers who will purchase the various baked good products and services marketed by our company or that our company will generate sufficient revenues to meet our expenses or to achieve or maintain profitability   substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern     we had no revenues for the fiscal year ended december   and now operating losses for the reporting period then ended these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern    we are attempting to generate sufficient revenue however our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues and in our ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company’s ability to further implement its business plan generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds   failure to manage relationships with our vendors   maintaining good relationships with suppliers of products and services that are offered through our website that compete with each other can be difficult  for example suppliers of similar products may compete for desirable virtual shelf space or priority exposure of their products on our website to our customer base  there can be no assurance that our current vendors will continue to offer their products and services through our website or that we will be able to establish new or extend current vendor relationships to ensure a steady supply to our members in a timely and costefficient manner  if we are unable to develop and maintain good relationships with these manufacturers and distributors it may inhibit our ability to offer products and services demanded by our customers or to offer them in sufficient quantities and at prices acceptable to them in addition if our vendors cease to provide us with favorable pricing or payment terms or return policies our working capital requirements may increase and our operations may be materially and adversely affected any breakdown in our relationships with the manufacturers and distributors or a failure to timely resolve disputes with or complaints from our vendors could materially and adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations   counterfeit products sold at our website   we anticipate to offer goods and products from all over the world those manufacturers and distributors are separately responsible for sourcing the products they sell on our website although we plan to adopt necessary measures to verify the authenticity of products sold on our website and minimize potential infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights in the course of sourcing and selling products we may not always be successful  in the event that counterfeit or infringing products are sold on our website we could face claims that we should be held liable for selling counterfeit products or infringing on others’ intellectual property rights if there is a successful claim against us we might be required to pay substantial damages or refrain from further sale of the relevant products  moreover regardless of whether we successfully defend against such claims our reputation could be severely damaged successful claims of infringement of thirdparty intellectual property rights against us is a violation by the sellers of products and services on our website of agreements we have with such sellers which automatically terminates such agreement and any damages obtained against us may be deducted from sales by such sellers any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition    failure to comply with governmental laws or regulations   in connection with the operation of our business we are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including those related to     ● nutritional content labeling and disclosure requirements         ● management and protection of the personal data of our employees and customers         ● sales tax and       ● various federal state and local laws relating to among other things business health food safety codes   these laws and regulations are complex which complicates monitoring and compliance as a result regulatory risks are inherent in our operations we may experience material difficulties or failures with respect to compliance with these laws and regulations in the future our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in litigation fines penalties judgments or other sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business operations and reputation              significant adverse impact to our capital reserve of any liable uninsured claim   we may not have sufficient insurance to cover potential risks and liabilities including but not limited to injuries or economic losses arising out of or relating to our omission or errors in providing our services even if we decide to obtain additional insurance coverage in the future it is possible that  we may not be able to get enough insurance to meet our needs  we may have to pay very high premiums for the additional coverage  we may not be able to acquire any insurance for certain types of business risk or  we may have gaps in coverage for certain risks we may be exposed to potential uninsured claims for which we could have to expend significant amounts of capital consequently if we were found liable for a significant uninsured claim in the future we may be forced to expend a significant amount of our capital to resolve the uninsured claim   our ability to adapt to constantly changing consumer preferences   the ecommerce and retail industries are subject to changing consumer preferences  consequently we must stay abreast of emerging lifestyle and consumer trends and anticipate trends that will appeal to existing and potential customers  if our members cannot find their desired products on our website they may stop purchasing products and services on our website stop visiting our website or visit less often  if we do not anticipate identify and respond effectively to consumer preferences or changes in consumer trends at an early stage we may not be able to generate our desired level of sales  such circumstances could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   interruption in the functioning of our network or services   we conduct all of our transactions through our website and the proper functioning of our website is essential to our business our website is subject to unanticipated interruptions through failures of our software or network or virus attacks the satisfactory performance reliability and availability of our website our transactionprocessing systems and our network infrastructure are critical to our success and our ability to attract and retain customers any system interruptions caused by telecommunications failures computer viruses hacking or other attempts to harm our systems that result in the unavailability or slowdown of our website or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of products and services sold and the attractiveness of offerings at our website  our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic breakins and similar disruptions which could lead to interruptions delays loss of data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders we may also experience interruptions caused by reasons beyond our control there can be no assurance that such unexpected interruptions will not happen and occurrences could damage our reputation and result in a material decrease in our revenues   dependence on key personnel   the company will be dependent on its key executives for the foreseeable future the loss of the services from our officers could have a material adverse effect on the operations and prospects of the company our officers are expected to handle all marketing and sales efforts and manage the operations in the early stage their responsibilities include developing and maintaining the customer base for our website launching our website and formulating marketing materials to be used as part of ongoing marketing efforts designed to build customer demand for the company’s products and services another seasoned business manager with an interest and skills in the ecommerce industry would be needed to run the company if the current officers are no longer available at this time the company does not have an employment agreement with mr low or mr chan though the company may enter into such an agreement with them on terms and conditions usual and customary for its industry the company does not currently have “key man” life insurance on the officers   intense competition   we expect the online retail environment to be intensely competitive and we face competition from established global or regional ecommerce businesses as well as traditional retailers that are expanding into ecommerce   we compete with our competitors primarily on technological advancements price and quality of products and services volume of traffic and users quality of website and content strategic relationships quality of services effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts talented staff and pricing we believe our particular disadvantages are that our website has had limited time in the marketplace and we must recruit and train experienced personnel over time our competitors may gradually build certain competitive advantages over us in terms of greater brand recognition among internet users better products and services larger customer and vendor bases more extensive and welldeveloped marketing and sales networks and substantially greater financial and technical resources   need for financing   we largely depend on additional capital to implement our business plan and support our operations currently we have no established bankfinancing arrangements therefore it is likely we will need to seek additional financing through future private offering of our equity securities or through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners we have no current plans for additional financing in place    we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us if at all the sale of additional equity securities will result in dilution to our shareholders the occurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations   if we are unable to raise capital as needed we are required to reduce the scope of our business development activities which could harm our business plans financial condition and operating results or cease our operations entirely in which case you will lose all your investment            adverse effect to your interest upon additional financing   if we raise additional capital subsequent to this offering through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution in addition we may also have to issue securities that may have rights preferences and privileges senior to our common stock in the event we seek to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or its equivalents this will result in increased interest expense   indemnification and limitation of liability   our articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that eliminate the personal liability of the directors of the company for monetary damages to the fullest extent possible under the laws of the state of nevada or other applicable law these provisions eliminate the liability of directors to the company and its shareholders for monetary damages arising out of any violation of a director of her fiduciary duty of due care under nevada law however such provisions do not eliminate the personal liability of a director for i breach of the director’s duty of loyalty ii acts or omissions not in good faith or involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law iii payment of dividends or repurchases of stock other than from lawfully available funds or iv any transaction from which the director derived an improper benefit these provisions do not affect a director’s liabilities under the federal securities laws or the recovery of damages by third parties    disruptions in the national and global economies   disruptions in the united states national and global economies may result in high unemployment rates and declines in consumer confidence and spending if such conditions occur they may result in significant declines in the retail industry which could directly affect the demand of our products there can be no assurance that government responses to the disruptions will be able to restore investor confidence disruptions in the national and global economies therefore may adversely impact our revenues results of operations business and financial condition   risks related to our common stock   restricted securities limited transferability   the securities should be considered a longterm illiquid investment our securities have not been registered under the securities act and cannot be sold without registration under the securities act or any exemption from registration in addition the securities are not registered under any state securities laws that would permit their transfer because of these restrictions and the absence of an active trading market for our securities a shareholder will likely be unable to liquidate an investment even though other personal financial circumstances would dictate such liquidation   no trading market   there is no established trading marketing for our common stock and there can be no assurance that one will ever develop market liquidity will depend on the perception of our operating business and any steps that our management might take to bring us to the awareness of investors there can be no assurance given that there will be any awareness generated consequently investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business as a result holders of our securities may not find purchasers for our securities should they to sell securities held by them consequently our securities should be purchased only by investors having no need for liquidity in their investment and who can hold our securities for an indefinite period of time   not likely to pay dividends   we currently intend to retain any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business accordingly we do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future but will review this policy as circumstances dictate   may be subject now and in the future to the sec’s “penny stock” rules   we may be subject now and in the future to the sec’s “penny stock” rules if our shares of common stock sell below  per share penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than  the penny stock rules require brokerdealers to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market the brokerdealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock the compensation of the brokerdealer and its salesperson and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account the bid and offer quotations and the brokerdealer and salesperson compensation information must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to completing the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation   in addition the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction the broker dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction the penny stock rules are burdensome and may reduce purchases of any offerings and reduce the trading activity for shares of our common stock as long as our shares of common stock are subject to the penny stock rules the holders of such shares of common stock may find it more difficult to sell their securities            costs to comply with us corporate governance and accounting requirements   we may incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including but not limited to requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly we also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these newly applicable rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs in addition we may not be able to absorb these costs of being a public company which will negatively affect our business operations   management’s lack of public company experience   our   management lacks public company experience which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by sarbanesoxley act of  our management has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis our management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal regulatory compliance and reporting requirements including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting any such deficiencies weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” which is necessary to maintain our public company status if we were to fail to fulfill those obligations our ability to continue as a us public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose your entire investment in our company   our status as an “emerging growth company” under the jobs act of    we are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jobs act and for as long as we continue to be an “emerging growth company” we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to “emerging growth companies” including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act of  reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved we could be an “emerging growth company” for up to five years or until the earliest of i the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed  billion ii the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in rule b under the exchange act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or iii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three year period   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to use the extended transition period provided above and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates   because of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an “emerging growth company” we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reports are not as transparent as other companies in our industry if we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected     item b

unregistered securities   we were incorporated in the state of nevada on december   in connection with the incorporation we issued  shares of common stock valued at  per share to each of our two directors  these shares were issued in reliance on the exemption under section  of the securities act of  as amended    in february  we sold through a regulation s offering a total of  shares of

believe expect estimate anticipate intend project and similar expressions or words which by their nature refer to future events you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions   overview   we were incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of nevada mon space net inc “mon space” plans to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services to its members using a business to business to consumer model bbc with respect to our business we plan to build an online platform that allows the users to be “merchants” as well as “shoppers” at the same time through the features products and services offered in our platform the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and encourage them to promote and advertise their products on our platform in the meantime the users could purchase products and services from other users who sell such products and services at a discounted price our platform is also designed and built to encourage users to return and refer new users it is the company’s objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant users on our platform can offer their products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels and so that our shopper users will choose our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services despite of our plan we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal    in february  we completed a regulation s offering in which we sold  shares of common stock to thirtyseven  investors at a purchase price of  per share for aggregate offering proceeds of              plan of operations   our goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to obtain new members and merchandisers    in april  we acquired the company monspacemall sdn bhd “msb” which owned and operated an ecommerce platform called “monspacemallcom” msb was incorporated less than one year but the ecommerce platform started commercialisation in q  we shall inject more database of consumers into this platform to build the user base   in the next three months thereafter we plan to expand our merchants and product base and increase membership through aggressive referral campaigns by the thenexisting members we also plan to set up warehouse and logistic systems for orders distribution and packaging as well as to hire necessary warehouse and logistic staff   during the third quarter it is our goal to create our own brand merchandises for items such as apparel gift products and other promotional items we plan to achieve this by hiring internal design staff for our own products   by the end of the next fiscal year it is our goal to set up offices in countries such as china indonesia vietnam and thailand for sourcing more merchants we also plan to engage in marketing activities in various local markets to bring in more awareness of our online platform our goal is to obtain as many members as possible so that we can use our members’ collective bargaining power to negotiate the lowest price with the merchants for their products    if we are unable to build a sustainable customer base through our marketing channels we will cease our development andor marketing operations until we raise money attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the otcqb for which there is no assurance if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans    recent development   on march   we incorporated msni m sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia “msni malaysia” as a whollyowned subsidiary of our company msni malaysia entered into a collaboration agreement the “collaboration agreement” with monspacemall sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia “monspacemall” on april   pursuant to the collaboration agreement msni malaysia agreed to conduct its business jointly with monspacemall under the name of “monspacemallcom” as part of the collaboration msni malaysia has agreed to contribute an initial consumer database of up to  members to the business whereas monspacemall has agreed to provide services in connection with the management and operation of the ecommerce engine with domain name “monspacemallcom” in consideration of its respective contribution to the

pursuant to which we agreed to purchase  equity interest or  ordinary shares of monspacemall for an aggregate purchase of us the consummation of the acquisition is subject to the completion of the audit for monspacemall forwardlooking statement not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language    results of operations   fiscal year ended december     we generated no revenue for the fiscal years ended december   and  we incurred operating expenses of  which is solely attributable to general and administrative expenses comparing to  for the fiscal year ended december   the significant increase is primarily due to the significant increase of professional expenses incurred from the launch of our business as a result we had a net loss of    our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern   liquidity and capital resources   as of december   we had a cash balance of  during  we raised  from the sale of our common stock to fund our future operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we can provide no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months            we have nominal assets and have generated no revenues since inception we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures we may be required to raise additional funds particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing for up to  months in addition our company may from time to time receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties however as of the date of this registration statement such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support our business nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties other than working capital we presently have no other alternative source of working capital we may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations we may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we do not anticipate we will be profitable in  therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities obtaining credit facilities or other financing mechanisms however a downturn in the us equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing furthermore if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock the inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations if we are unable to obtain additional financing we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations    we anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future therefore our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern   our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly   going concern   our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern    the company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of  for the financial year ended december   these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing there can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to our company   we are attempting to generate sufficient revenue however our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability to raise additional funds   significant and critical accounting policies and practices   while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis    use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   recent accounting pronouncements   from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed we believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations   offbalance sheet arrangements   we have no offbalance sheet arrangements   contractual obligations   we do not have any contractual obligations at this

statements are free of material misstatement the company is not required to have nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting accordingly we express no such opinion an audit also includes examining on a test basis evidence supporting the amounts and

marketplace to sell products and services using a business to business to consumer model the company’s operations to date have been limited to offering shares of common stock to investors    basis of presentation   the financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” in all material respects   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions balances held by the company are not typically in excess of fdic insured limits at december   all of the company’s cash was deposited in one bank    stockbased compensation   the company estimates the fair value of each stockbased compensation award at the grant date by using blackscholes option pricing model the fair value determined represents the cost of the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award as stockbased compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest excess tax benefits if any are recognized as additional paid in capital   income taxes   an asset and liability approach is used for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration    earnings loss per common share   basic earnings loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted earnings loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the entity as of

issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration   new accounting pronouncements   in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no  “compensation – stock compensation” topic  the fasb issued this update to improve the accounting for employee sharebased payments and affect all organizations that issue sharebased payment awards to their employees several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment award transactions are simplified including a income tax consequences b classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and c classification on the statement of cash flows the updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption of the update is permitted the company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard   in may  the fasb issued asu  “ revenue from contracts with customers topic  ” the new guidance provides new criteria for recognizing revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance requires expanded disclosures to provide greater insight into both revenue that has been recognized and revenue that is expected to be recognized in the future from existing contracts quantitative and qualitative information will be provided about the significant judgments and changes in those judgments that management made to determine the revenue that is recorded this accounting standard update as amended will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after december   the new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption early adoption is permitted but no earlier than fiscal  the company is currently assessing the provisions of the guidance and has not determined the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its financial statements   in august  the fasb issues asu  disclosure of uncertainties about and entity’s activities to continue as a going concern the new standard requires management to assess the company’s ability to continue as a going concern disclosures are required if there is substantial doubt as to the company’s continuation as a going concern within one year after the issue date of financial statements the standard provides guidance for making the assessment including consideration of management’s plans which may alleviate doubt regarding the company’s ability to continue as a going concern asu  is effective for years beginning after december   we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements    note  – going concern   the company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of  for theyear ended december   the companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations andor obtaining additional financing from its shareholders or other sources as may be required    the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern however the above conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to do so the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   in order to maintain its current level of operations the company will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations debt financing or from the sale of its equity however the company currently has no commitments from any third parties for financing if the company is unable to acquire additional financing it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations or cease business      f        note  – equity    the company is authorized to issue  shares of common stock   on december

and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer our principal executive officer principal financial officer and principle accounting officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report due to the material weakness in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following     lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures    inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives    ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes and    lack of accounting personnel with adequate experience and training   management’s report on internal control over financial reporting      the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company our internal control system was designed to in general provide reasonable assurance to the companys management and board regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements but because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate            our management assessed the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december   the framework used by management in making that assessment was the criteria set forth in the document entitled “internal control – integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso –  framework  based on that evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   this was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that amounted to material weaknesses   the matters involving internal control over financial reporting that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives of having segregation of the initiation of transactions the recording of transactions and the custody of assets and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes  the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our chief executive officer and chief financial officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of december      managements remediation initiatives   in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we plan to initiate the following series of measures   we plan to increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us first we plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives of having separate individuals perform i the initiation of transactions ii the recording of transactions and iii the custody of assets second we will create a senior position to focus on financial reporting and standardizing and documenting our accounting procedures with the goal of increasing the effectiveness of the internal controls in preventing and detecting misstatements of accounting information third we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us   management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board we did not implement the said remedial measures in  we anticipate that these remedial measures will be implemented when our financial conditions permit   changes in internal controls over financial reporting   no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth fiscal

edgar online via comtex  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following plan of operation provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition the discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto this section includes a number of forwardlooking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance forwardlooking statements are often identified by words like believe expect estimate anticipate intend project and similar expressions or words which by their nature refer to future events you should not place undue certainty on these forwardlooking statements these forwardlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions overview we were incorporated on december   under the laws of the state of nevada mon space net inc mon space plans to build an online marketplace that will be created to sell products and services to its members using a business to business to consumer model bbc with respect to our business we plan to build an online platform that allows the users to be merchants as well as shoppers at the same time through the features products and services offered in our platform the platform is expected to create interaction among the users and encourage them to promote and advertise their products on our platform in the meantime the users could purchase products and services from other users who sell such products and services at a discounted price our platform is also designed and built to encourage users to return and refer new users it is the companys objective to develop a large base of users so that the merchant users on our platform can offer their products and services at a discount that is not available through any other channels and so that our shopper users will choose our platform as their primary destination for purchasing products and services despite of our plan we currently have no commitments for any financing and cannot provide assurance that we will realize this goal in february  we completed a regulation s offering in which we sold  shares of common stock to thirtyseven  investors at a purchase price of  per share for aggregate offering proceeds of  plan of operations our goal is to maintain the quality of our product and to obtain the resources sufficient to obtain new members and merchandisers in april  we acquired the company monspacemall sdn bhd msb which owned and operated an ecommerce platform called monspacemallcom msb was incorporated less than one year but the ecommerce platform started commercialisation in q  we shall inject more database of consumers into this platform to build the user base in the next three months thereafter we plan to expand our merchants and product base and increase membership through aggressive referral campaigns by the thenexisting members we also plan to set up warehouse and logistic systems for orders distribution and packaging as well as to hire necessary warehouse and logistic staff during the third quarter it is our goal to create our own brand merchandises for items such as apparel gift products and other promotional items we plan to achieve this by hiring internal design staff for our own products by the end of the next fiscal year it is our goal to set up offices in countries such as china indonesia vietnam and thailand for sourcing more merchants we also plan to engage in marketing activities in various local markets to bring in more awareness of our online platform our goal is to obtain as many members as possible so that we can use our members collective bargaining power to negotiate the lowest price with the merchants for their products if we are unable to build a sustainable customer base through our marketing channels we will cease our development andor marketing operations until we raise money attempting to raise capital after failing in any phase of our development plan could be difficult as such if we cannot secure additional proceeds we will have to cease operations and investors would lose their entire investment we intend to raise additional capital through private placements once we gain a quotation on the otcqb for which there is no assurance if we need additional cash but are unable to raise it we will either suspend marketing operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely other than as described in this paragraph we have no other financing plans recent development on march   we incorporated msni m sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia msni malaysia as a whollyowned subsidiary of our company msni malaysia entered into a collaboration agreement the collaboration agreement with monspacemall sdn bhd a company formed under the laws of malaysia monspacemall on april   pursuant to the collaboration agreement msni malaysia agreed to conduct its business jointly with monspacemall under the name of monspacemallcom as part of the collaboration msni malaysia has agreed to contribute an initial consumer database of up to  members to the business whereas monspacemall has agreed to provide services in connection with the management and operation of the ecommerce engine with domain name monspacemallcom in consideration of its respective contribution to the collaboration msni malaysia and monspacemall will each receive  of the profit generated from monspacemallcom on april   we entered into an acquisition agreement with the shareholders of monspacemall pursuant to which we agreed to purchase  equity interest or  ordinary shares of monspacemall for an aggregate purchase of us the consummation of the acquisition is subject to the completion of the audit for monspacemall forwardlooking statement not accompanied by meaningful cautionary language results of operations fiscal year ended december   we generated no revenue for the fiscal years ended december   and  we incurred operating expenses of  which is solely attributable to general and administrative expenses comparing to  for the fiscal year ended december   the significant increase is primarily due to the significant increase of professional expenses incurred from the launch of our business as a result we had a net loss of  our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had a cash balance of  during  we raised  from the sale of our common stock to fund our future operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we can provide no assurance that we can continue to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months we have nominal assets and have generated no revenues since inception we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures we may be required to raise additional funds particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations we estimate that based on current plans and assumptions our available cash will not be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements under our present operating expectations without further financing for up to  months in addition our company may from time to time receive continued funding and capital resources from related parties however as of the date of this registration statement such related parties do not have any existing obligation to advance funds or working capital to support our business nor can our company rely on any advance funds from such related parties other than working capital we presently have no other alternative source of working capital we may not have sufficient working capital to fund the expansion of our operations and to provide working capital necessary for our ongoing operations and obligations we may need to raise significant additional capital to fund our operating expenses pay our obligations and grow our company we do not anticipate we will be profitable in  therefore our future operations may be dependent on our ability to secure additional financing financing transactions may include the issuance of equity or debt securities obtaining credit facilities or other financing mechanisms however a downturn in the us equity and debt markets could make it more difficult to obtain financing through the issuance of equity or debt securities even if we are able to raise the funds required it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses fail to collect amounts owed to us or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing furthermore if we issue additional equity or debt securities stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock the inability to obtain additional capital will restrict our ability to grow and may reduce our ability to continue to conduct business operations if we are unable to obtain additional financing we will likely be required to curtail our marketing and development plans and possibly cease our operations we anticipate that depending on market conditions and our plan of operations we may incur operating losses in the foreseeable future therefore our auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our liquidity may be negatively impacted by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements costs associated with newly applicable corporate governance requirements including requirements under the sarbanesoxley act of  and other rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission we expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly going concern our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to recoverability and classification of recorded amounts of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern the company has not yet generated any revenue since its inception and has operating losses of  for the financial year ended december   these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our continued existence is dependent upon our ability to continue to execute our operating plan and to obtain additional debt or equity financing there can be no assurance that the necessary debt or equity financing will be available or will be available on terms acceptable to our company we are attempting to generate sufficient revenue however our cash position may not be sufficient to support our daily operations while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient revenues in the future and in our ability to raise additional funds there can be no assurances to that effect the ability of our company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan generate sufficient revenue to cover operating expenses and in our ability to raise additional funds significant and critical accounting policies and practices while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  to our financial statements we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates recent accounting pronouncements from time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by our company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed we believe that recently issued accounting pronouncements adopted do not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements contractual obligations we do not have any contractual obligations at this time apr   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage don’t have a
