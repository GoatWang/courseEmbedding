us productapplicationrelated questions sample request about applied minerals the dragon mine sustainability mission our products the dragon mine is the only known measured resource of halloysite clay in the western hemisphere significant enough for large scale commercial production it is located in the tintic district of utah covering  acres of fully owned land with mining permits for extraction of minerals  applied minerals inc developed the dragon mine with a clear focus on customer needs and markets to achieve this the company has retained worldrenowned experts in halloysite to create a standard for the characterization quantification and commercialization of this unique mineral as a result of these efforts applied minerals is able to deliver commercially consistent product grades of the highest quality halloysite in the world underground resource   clay applied minerals’ extensive drilling program continues to explore underground areas of the dragon property including two mines developed by prior operators as well as one area that had previously remained unexplored  to date it has been determined that the collective area contains a measured resource of  tons of clay extraction of material from targeted areas of this resource is in progress iron oxide the dragon mine also contains an ultrapure iron oxide resource consisting of goethite and hematite to date it has been determined that the property contains a measured resource of  tons of iron oxide  further exploration and analysis of the underground resource is ongoing   surface piles surface pile on the dragon mine property the company through its geologic survey has measured five surface piles on the dragon property encompassing  million tons of material which can be processed to create purified halloysite products the piles were formed by prior operators from  to  who rejected the mined clay because it did not meet the criteria for their specific end market the operators abandoned the dragon mine in  when they believed all economic and acceptable resources of halloysite had been exhausted and an ability to purify the surface piles did not exist now available today the surface piles were never removed as the operator failed to appropriately remediate the land applied minerals extraction of material from these surface piles provides that overdue remediation restoring the land to its natural undisturbed state to date applied minerals has characterized the chemistry and mineralogy of the surface piles and developed a processing system to convert them into purified halloysite products    production capabilities applied minerals utilizes a dry beneficiation method to process its halloysite products through a micronizing system located on the mine site the process utilizes a low energy jet mill without the employment of any chemicals additional capability through rd party partnerships  wet processing  masterbatch production cautionary note to us investors  the united

products halloysite is an aluminosilicate clay exhibiting a rare naturally occurring hollow tubular structure halloysite tubes have a length in the range of    microns an exterior diameter in the range of    nanometers and an internal diameter lumen in the range of    nanometers halloysite is nontoxic and natural  demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment  it is chemically identical to commonly used kaolin clay alsiooh x nho with one layer of water molecules existing between layers of alumina and silica formation occurs when kaolin sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers this is a process that occurs over millions of years under extremely rare conditions applied minerals markets its line of halloysite products under the dragonite™ brand name the company produces different product grades tailored to enhance the property performance of each target application versatile halloysite product grade with a wide range of applications including controlled release environmental remediation agriculture paints and coatings and catalysts advanced
