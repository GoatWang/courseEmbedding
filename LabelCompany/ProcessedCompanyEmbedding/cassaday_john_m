some feeling everything you have said is all well and good but how do you handle it when you suffer from a chronic illness this gives you a sense of her personal motivation she was taken aback how did this woman know had she seen judy in hospital or at her doctor’s office then judy realized that in asking the question this woman was talking about herself and not about judy this woman too was suffering from a chronic illness so i asked judy did you tell her about your condition judy said no she didn’t think it worthwhile getting into a discussion over whose illness was worse instead she said i tried not to appear patronizing but i passed on three things what i had worked out for myself first she told the young woman “don’t be afraid at least try not to be afraid fear undermines everything it immobilizes you” second be honest with yourself decide what really matters to you and do it do it now because there may not be a later and third whatever you choose to do do it well make
