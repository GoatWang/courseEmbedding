response to various motions to transfer six consolidated petitions for review of the epa regulations which prohibit significant deterioration of air quality in areas where it exceeds national standards the court holds that the dc circuit is the appropriate circuit to decide these review petitions under § b of the clean air act the regulations in question are the product of a unitary rulemaking proceeding are national in scope and apply uniformly throughout the country moreover they appear to raise no questions of law or fact which will vary from one jurisdiction to another multiple reviews might result in inconsistent decisions and since their promulgation was mandated by the dc circuit that court is in the best position to determine whether its order has been followed

respondent environmental protection agency edmund b clark erica dolgin department of justice washington dc  richard j denney jr environmental protection agency washington dc   elr  phillips chief judge these consolidated cases require us to decide which circuit court of appeals should hear petitions filed by numerous parties seeking review of certain regulations promulgated by the environmental protection agency epa for the reasons stated below we believe that the clean air act  usc §§  et seq establishes the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit as the proper court to decide the petitions for review and accordingly we must transfer these cases to that court before  epa took the position that the clean air act did not prevent the states from allowing existing air quality to deteriorate so long as the pollution remained less than the level prescribed in the national secondary ambient air quality standards in  however the district court for the district of columbia concluded otherwise and ordered epa to promulgate regulations prohibiting significant deterioration of air quality in areas where the existing air quality is better than the national standards sierra club v ruckelshaus  f supp  ddc affd mem  erc  dc cir  affd by an equally divided court sub nom fri v sierra club  us   in response to the district courts order epa promulgated regulations  fed reg   establishing three classes of areas in class i areas almost any deterioration would be impermissible in class ii areas the deterioration normally accompanying moderate growth would be permitted and in class iii areas deterioration up to the national standards would be permitted the regulations initially designated all areas as class ii subject to redesignation initiated by the states in accordance with a specified administrative procedure in addition the regulations established a preconstruction review procedure for certain new and modified stationary emission sources to ensure that the permissible pollution increment for the area would not be exceeded the regulations were developed through a unitary rulemaking procedure and they have the effect of amending every states air quality implementation plan in precisely the same way the regulations were announced by epa and explained in some detail at a large public meeting held in washington dc on the morning of november   at  pm on november  a petition for review of these regulations was filed in this court by dayton power and light company and four other utilities at  pm on the same day sierra club filed a similar petition in the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit additional petitions for review of these regulations subsequently were filed in this court and in the fifth seventh ninth and tenth circuits sierra club was permitted to intervene in the cases filed in this court the fifth and ninth circuit cases have been transferred to this court and the seventh and tenth circuit cases have been transferred to the district of columbia circuit the dayton power and light company has petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel epa to file the administrative record in this court sierra club and epa have filed motions to transfer the petitions for review to the district of columbia circuit petitioners in the ninth circuit cases have filed motions to transfer their petitions back to the ninth circuitall of these petitions and motions raise the common question whether this court or some other court should review these regulations on the merits  elr  the air quality deterioration regulations at issue here amended state implementation plans and as such they were promulgated pursuant to  usc § cc the parties therefore conclude and we agree that jurisdiction to review these regulations is conferred by  usc § hb which provides as follows b a petition for review of action of the administrator in promulgating any national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard any emission standard under section c of this title any standard of performance under section c of this title any standard under section f of this title other than a standard required to be prescribed under section fb of this title any determination under section fb of this title any control or prohibition under section fc of this title or any standard under section f of this title may be filed only in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia a petition for review of the administrators action in approving or promulgating any implementation plan under section c of this title or section cd of this title or his action under section cca b or c of this title or under regulations thereunder may be filed only in the united states court of appeals for the appropriate circuit any such petition shall be filed within  days from the date of such promulgation approval or action or after such date if such petition is based solely on grounds arising after such th day this case plainly falls within the second sentence of § hb and we therefore must determine which is the appropriate circuit to review these regulations dayton power and light company and the other petitioners take the position that because the regulations amend state implementation plans interested persons are entitled to review in the court of appeals for the local circuit thus under the theory of petitioners this court would be the appropriate circuit to review the regulations insofar as they amend the implementation plans of michigan ohio kentucky and tennessee petitioners also suggest that even if it is concluded that both the sixth and the district of columbia circuits are appropriate the regulations still should be reviewed here under  usc § a since the first petition for review was filed in this court sierra club and epa argue that because the regulations are national in scope and uniformly applicable to every state the district of columbia circuit is the appropriate circuit within the meaning of § hb in addition sierra club contends that the first valid petition for review in fact was filed in the district of columbia circuit and that  uss § a therefore offers no support for petitioners position initially we note that the first sentence of § hb lists a number of administrative actions that may be reviewed only in the district of columbia circuit the second sentence specifies other actions including amendments to implementation plans that may be reviewed only in the appropriate circuit petitioners argue that because congress expressly made certain epa decisions reviewable exclusively in the district of columbia circuit it would be anomalous to interpret the word appropriate in a way that would produce the same result with respect to other types of administrative decisions thus petitioners believe that by appropriate congress must have meant the local circuit having jurisdiction over the state or air quality region affected by the administrative action at issue the problem with this interpretation is that elsewhere in the clean air act congress has conferred jurisdiction specifically upon the circuit that includes the affected state for example an epa decision postponing applicability of a particular states implementation plan to certain pollution sources would be subject to review by the united states court of appeals for the circuit which includes such state      usc § cfb we believe that if congress had intended a similar meaning for the second sentence of § hb it would have said so accordingly we must assume that congress purposely used the indefinite phrase appropriate circuit in conferring jurisdiction the legislative history of the act provides some clues to the meaning of appropriate circuit the parties refer us to the following passage from the senate report because many of these administrative actions are national in scope and require even and consistent national application the provision specifies that any review of such actions shall be in the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia for review of the approval or promulgation of implementation plans which run only to one air quality control region the section places jurisdiction in the us court of appeals for the circuit in which the affected air quality control region or portion thereof is located s rep no  st cong d sess   the subject of the quoted language is §  of senate bill  which is quite similar to § hb this language appears to be merely descriptive of the types of administrative actions specifically enumerated in § hb and does not lead inescapably to any particular interpretation of the word appropriate the passage however does reflect a congressional belief that consistent application of national regulations is often desirable and can be achieved through exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia circuit the reported decisions provide considerably more assistance in locating the appropriate circuit in natural resources defense council v epa  fd  st cir  petitioners sought review of administrative action granting a twoyear extension of the statutory deadline for attainment of air quality standards for transportationrelated pollutants and approving state plans that failed to provide for the adoption of transportation controls petitioners filed motions to transfer the case to the district of columbia circuit and the court was required to determine which circuit was the appropriate one under § hb the court concluded that congress had suggested a flexible approach by using the imprecise term appropriate circuit accordingly the court weighed all of the factors bearing upon its decision whatever words are used to describe the administrators actions on the three issues presented we fail to understand how his rationale relates specifically to each individual state plan the legal issues raised by petitioners in the first circuit seem to be identical with those raised in every other circuit the parties are the same there do not appear to be factual questions unique to each circuit we must also consider that litigation in several circuits with possible inconsistent and delayed results on the merits can only serve to frustrate the strong congressional interest in improving the environment as evidenced by the clean air act additionally we do not feel that judicial manpower is so abundant so as to permit several circuits to solve identical complex legal and factual issues in the present case we note that petitioners first filed in the united states court of appeals for the district  elr  of columbia circuit that is where the environmental protection agency has its headquarters that is where the appropriate files are kept and where the regulations were announced in light of all these factors we are led to conclude that the dc circuit is the appropriate circuit to hear petitioners claims  fd at  the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit subsequently accepted the transfer from the first circuit agreeing that congress intended to adopt a flexible approach to determine which circuit is appropriate     under § hb natural resources defense council v epa  fd   dc cir  in assuming jurisdiction the district of columbia circuit looked to several of the factors that also had influenced the first circuit applying this flexible approach to the cases presently before us it is clear from the record that all of these cases raise identical legal issues none of these issues involve facts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction rather all concern uniform determinations of nationwide effect made by the administrator requiring these cases to be prosecuted in the several circuits will only lead to delay on a question where time is literally of the essence and will needlessly tax the agencys legal resources we therefore hold that we have jurisdiction to hear these cases  fd at  we conclude that these two recent cases were decided correctly and that the case at bar should be subjected to a similar analysis the regulations at issue here were the product of a unitary rulemaking proceeding they are national in scope and apply uniformly throughout the country at this stage we perceive in this case no questions of law or fact that will vary from one jurisdiction to another if these regulations were to be reviewed in the court of appeals for each circuit there would be a substantial risk of seriously inconsistent results and an inevitable delay in the effectuation of the important national policies underlying the clean air act finally we note that the regulations were promulgated in response to an order affirmed by the district of columbia circuit clearly that court is in the best position to determine whether the regulations are consistent with its order for these reasons we hold that the district of columbia circuit is the appropriate circuit to review these regulations within the meaning of § hb moreover we conclude that  usc § a has no application to this case that section would control only if petitions for review had been filed in more than one appropriate circuit it follows that all six of these cases must be transferred to the district of columbia circuit an action we take in the exercise of our inherent power to transfer cases to another court of appeals see natural resources defense council v epa supra  fd   st cir  eastern air lines inc v cab  fd   dc cir  panhandle eastern pipe line co v fpc  fd   th cir  accordingly we deny the petition for a writ of mandamus to require epa to file the administrative record in this court the motions made by petitioners in the ninth circuit cases to transfer their cases back to the ninth circuit are denied the motions made by epa and the sierra club to transfer these cases to the district of columbia circuit are granted and it is ordered that all six cases be transferred to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit all other matters are left for decision by the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit the costs in this court are assessed against the petitioners  section a provides in part as follows if proceedings have been instituted in two or more courts of appeals with respect to the same order the agency board commission or officer concerned shall file the record in that one of such courts in which a proceeding with respects to such order was first instituted the other courts in which such proceedings are pending shall thereupon transfer them to the court of appeals in which the record has been filed for the convenience of the parties in the interest of justice such court may thereafter transfer all the proceedings with respect to such order to any other court of appeals  this distinguishes the present case from buckeye power inc v epa  fd   th cir  in which we stated that interested persons may file petitions for review of epa action aproving or disapproving state implementation plans only in the united states court of appeals having jurisdiction over their area beckeye involved not a uniform amendment to all state plans but the propriety of approving the particular plans submitted by kentucky and ohio and the sixth circuit was plainly the appropriate

property plant and equipment ppe are the fixed assets of the companyfixed assets are also known as noncurrent assets property plant and equipment includes assets that will  in the normal course of business  neither be used up in the next year nor will become a part of any product sold to customers some of the most common parts of property plant and equipment are  land  buildings and leasehold improvements  transportation equipment  manufacturing equipment  office equipment  office furniture companies with lots of property plant and equipment often have special categories for example railroad property includes  track  ties  ballast  bridges  tunnels  signals  locomotives  freight cars there is often a note in the financial statements  found in a companys k  that will explain the different categories of property a company owns the market value of property plant and equipment can differ tremendously from the book value of property plant and equipment for example when berkshire hathaway liquidated its textile mills it had to pay the buyers of the companys manufacturing equipment to haul the equipment away that property plant and equipment was literally worth less than zero on the other hand some companies own thousands of acres of land all property plant and equipment other than land is depreciated land is never depreciated however land is not marked up to market value either under generally accepted accounting principles gaap land is shown on the balance sheet at cost the property plant and equipment line shown on the balance sheet is usually net property plant and equipment this means it is the cost of the property plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation explanation a company with durable competitive advantage doesnt need to constantly upgrade its equipment to stay competitive the company replaces when it wears out on the other hand a company without any advantages must replace to keep pace difference between a company with a moat and one without is that the company with the competitive advantage finances new equipment through internal cash flows whereas the no advantage company requires debt to finance producing a consistent product that doesnt change equates to consistent profits there is no need to upgrade plants which frees up cash for other ventures think coca cola johnson  johnson etc related terms total
