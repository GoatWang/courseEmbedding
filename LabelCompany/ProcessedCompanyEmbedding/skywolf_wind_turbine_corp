traditional wind turbines standing between ’ to ’ tall our product is patent protected and the only turbine in existence that combines wind and solar in an innovative design there are several unique dawt properties that separate us from the completion our smaller footprint dawt places us in a perfect position as an alternative to the large wind turbine mfg and the small less robust turbine suppliers in addition the energy production of our dawt at lower wind speeds and ease of installation is a technical advantage over the large turbines as they need higher wind speeds to produce energy the added benefit of solar panels also allows us the technical advantage of producing power on any given day in any weather condition additionally our price point is very competitive against each turbine type with the small footprint design and high energy output utilizing wind and solar the hybrid dawt is well suited for multiple installations for micro grid applications to supporting

critical infrastructures municipal facilities government facilities colleges micro grids hospitals small business owners homeowner airports industry micro grid concept the typical power grid is a centralized model power is generated at a large central facility the voltage is steppedup to transmission voltage levels transmitted over miles and then distributed through a series of substations which reduce the power back down to distribution levels before finally being used by consumers conversely the microgrid conceptual model is based on local generation of power micro grids increase reliability locally through distributed generation energy storage redundant distribution automated switches and grid stabilization local generation and storage allow sections of the power grid to operate independently in an intentional island mode during a grid disturbance such as thunderstorms or heavy snow fall to minimize outages efficiency is increased by locating generation close to the consumption which reduces costs and losses associated with transmission micro grids also support sustainability through the incorporation of distributed energy resources der while maintaining grid stability how a microgrid works to better understand the micro grid one needs to be familiar with the isolated grid model isolated grids are basic grids in which a small industrial facility remote community or military base relies on der’s in the form of combustion type generation renewable generation sources pv wind biomass etc and storage systems such as flywheels or batteries for grid stability these generation systems deliver power onto a common grid or power bus simply installing an isolated grid into the utility system would cause grid instability the utility needs to be able to “see” what is occurring within the isolated grid in order to understand how to properly dispatch the necessary power a distributed control system dcs maintains a base load of power by forecasting demand determining the proper mix of der’s to meet the demand and maintains proper grid power quality with the objective of extending fuel reserves as long as possible americas micro – grid micro grids are better positioned than the centralized grid to meet the known and unknown needs of the future because the community participates in the production consumption and creation of new cost reducing revenue streams for their local grid this technology empowers consumers stimulates future electricity innovations and activates entrepreneurial freemarket funding latest news new york based

and notes before making an investment decision   corporate history and general information about the company   skywolf wind turbine corporation the “company” is an earlystage company which was incorporated under the laws of the state of new york on august   and was formerly known as brock renewable energy research  development corporation prior to the company completing a name change in march  the company is engaged in the business of the development and commercialization of wind turbines and other renewable energy technologies specifically the company is the designer manufacturer and supplier of a patented solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine hdawt a product that uses renewable wind and solar energy sources combined in one turbine   the company is located at  court street geneseo new york  the company’s main phone number is   the company’s fiscal year end is december  the company has not filed for bankruptcy receivership or any similar proceedings nor is in the process of filing for bankruptcy receivership or any similar proceedings   summary of the business and operations   company introduction   skywolf sells its patented solar hybrid wind turbine system which we believe is the ultimate renewable energy product our hdawt is designed to extract energy from both wind and sun simultaneously or individually depending on which energy source is available in addition it can be installed almost anywhere typically requiring only local building permits we believe that this technology opens the door to affordable clean power throughout the world for homeowners farmers municipalities colleges minigrids prisons airports commercial properties and in particular undeveloped countries since wind and sun energy are bountiful resources available worldwide     the solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine on site          corporate history and general information about the company   skywolf wind turbine corporation the “company” located at  court street geneseo new york  was incorporated under the laws of the state of new york on august   and was formerly known as brock renewable energy research  development corporation the company is the designer manufacturer and supplier of a patented solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine aka “the hybrid” which uses wind and solar energy sources combined in one unit the company has not filed for bankruptcy receivership or any similar proceedings nor is in the process of filing for bankruptcy receivership or any similar proceedings the company currently has six fulltime employeesconsultants along with several independent sales representatives the manufacturing facility and administrative offices are located in a single  sq ft building where products are developed manufactured marketed and sold along with feasibility studies to determine optimum site location     business and market summary   after six years of research and development that resulted in three patents we believe that skywolf has made a major technological breakthrough with its patented diffused augmented wind turbine design dawt we believe the dawt is capable of producing more energy output at lower wind speeds than conventional wind turbines and with a significantly smaller footprint by reducing static pressure behind its rotor blades we believe that the dawt will exponentially increase efficiency and electric energy output as compared to conventional wind turbines of the same size adding solar to the dawt resulted in another patent for a solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine hdawt or “hybrid” which we believe gives skywolf a distinct advantage in the renewable energy market by harnessing wind and solar energy simultaneously we believe that skywolf’s design addresses the pitfalls and limitations of conventional wind turbines specifically we believe that consumers with extremely rural or difficult sites or a varied mix of solarwind energy will greatly benefit from the hybrid design skywolf’s expected improvements over small to medium sized wind turbine competitors are listed below   · current height of competitors reduced from an average of  to sky wolfs     o no faa permit required for skywolf only a normal building permit   o skywolf only requires  ft  instead of  ft   acre   · the fan blades are enclosed in a shroud with skywolf which we believe    o results in substantial noise reduction   o eliminates sun flutter from large rotating blades   o removes the liability of ice flying off fan blades and causing injury   o dramatically reduces bird deaths   · we believe that skywolf reduces site issues because    o increased wind speed range makes more sites viable   o  height is like a tree hence much less visually challenging   o the small shroud containing the blades looks appealing   o it can be erected on any approved building lot   o maintenance is simple and cost effective at  no massive crane required           · we believe that skywolf dramatically increases efficiency because    o expands the operational wind speed range from    mph to  –  mph   o extracts at least  more power out of wind to make it much more affordable   · adding solar expands the number of usable sites and increases energy output   we believe that the void in this market segment provides a unique opportunity that can be filled by skywolf which we expect will set the stage for substantial market penetration and subsequent sales we believe that the most promising aspect of skywolf’s technology lies in the expansion of new sales to customers who are dissatisfied with the current limitations of conventional wind turbines our hybrid can extract both wind and solar energy simultaneously to give each customer usable power every day regardless of site location or weather each hybrid unit comes with a complete integrated system that captures converts and monitors wind and solar energy production which can be gridtied or connected into a battery based system offgrid our product is patent protected and is the only unit in the market that combines wind and solar in a unique and innovative design the unique properties of the hybrid gives consumers an alternative to larger and less efficient wind turbines andor oversized solar arrays the added benefit of solar panels incorporated into our hybrid design allows the generation of power over a broader range of conditions our competitive price point perfectly positions the hybrid nationally and internationally in the energy market additional state and federal tax credits assist in the sale and value of our hybrid in the us market the company has secured sales in new york state in both the agricultural and residential markets plus preliminary negotiations are underway in colombia south america south africa peru mexico and europe totaling billion dollars or more in potential sales   risks and uncertainties facing the company   as an earlystage company with a limited operating history the company has experienced losses since its inception the company’s independent auditors have issued a report questioning the company’s ability to continue as a going concern that is the company needs to create a source of revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans as a development stage company management of the company has limited experience in building and selling projects similar to that planned by the company and in marketing and distributing such projects on a broad scale   one of the biggest challenges facing the company is the ability to increase its sales revenue and raise adequate capital to develop and execute project opportunities   due to financial constraints the company has to date conducted limited operations if the company were unable to develop strong and reliable sources of funding for project opportunities it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s efforts are met with customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers neither of which are currently known or guaranteed   due to these and other factors the company’s need for additional capital the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   trading market   currently there is no trading market for the securities of the company the company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board as soon as possible which may be while this offering is still in process there can be no assurance that the company will qualify for quotation of its securities on the otc bulletin board see “risk factors” and “description of securities”          summary of this offering   the issuer   skywolf wind turbine corporation       securities being offered   up to  shares of common stock is being offered for sale by the company this collectively represents approximately  of the currently issued and outstanding shares of the companys common stock our common stock is described in further detail in the section of this prospectus titled “description of securities”       per share price          duration of offering   the shares are offered for a period not to exceed  months unless extended by our board of directors       number of shares outstanding before the offering   there are  shares of common stock issued and outstanding       net proceeds to the company   the company is offering a maximum of  shares of common stock at an offering price of  per share for net proceeds to the company of  the full subscription price will be payable at the time of subscription and accordingly funds received from subscribers in this offering will be released to the company when subscriptions are received and accepted   no assurance can be given that the net proceeds from the total number of shares offered hereby or any lesser net amount will be sufficient to accomplish our goals if proceeds from this offering are insufficient we may be required to seek additional capital no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such additional capital or even if available that such additional capital will be available on terms acceptable to us       use of proceeds   we will use the proceeds to obtain both certification by the small wind certification council swcc and european ce marking  proceeds will also be used to add additional staff required to grow the company including positions in sales marketing and administration  proceeds will also be used for working capital and to fund research and development to create new applications such as a hydro unit           risk factors   an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth under “risk factors” section hereunder and the other information contained in this prospectus before making an investment decision regarding our common stock          risk factors   you should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this prospectus before making an investment decision with regard to our securities the statements contained in or incorporated into this prospectus that are not historic facts are forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by forwardlooking statements if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in that case the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment     risks related to the offering   as there is no minimum for our offering if only a few persons purchase shares they could lose their investment   since there is no minimum with respect to the number of securities to be sold directly by the company in this offering if only a few securities are sold we may not have enough capital to sustain our business in such an event it is highly likely that any investment would be lost as such proceeds from this offering may not be sufficient to meet the objectives we state in this prospectus other corporate milestones that we may set or to avoid a “going concern” modification in future reports of our auditors as to uncertainty with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern if we fail to raise sufficient capital we would expect to have to significantly decrease operating expenses which will curtail the growth of our business   investing in the company is a highly speculative investment and could result in the loss of your entire investment   a purchase of the offered securities is significantly speculative and involves significant risks the offered securities should not be purchased by any person who cannot afford the loss of his or her entire purchase price the business objectives of the company are also speculative and we may be unable to satisfy those objectives the stockholders of the company may be unable to realize a substantial return on their purchase of the offered securities or any return whatsoever and may lose their entire investment in the company for this reason each prospective purchaser of the offered securities should read this prospectus and all of its exhibits carefully and consult with their attorney business advisor andor investment advisor   the offering price of the offered securities has been arbitrarily determined by the company and such offering should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the fair market value of the offered securities    currently there is no public market for the company’s common stock the offering price for the offered securities has been arbitrarily determined by the company and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets operations book or other established criteria of value of the company thus an investor should be aware that the offering price does not reflect the fair market price of the offered securities   risks associated with our company’s business   the company has limited revenues to date    the company has generated limited revenues to date most of management’s time and the company’s limited resources have been spent on rd and developing its business strategy most of the activity has been centered in the following areas researching potential opportunities contacting prospective partners exploring marketing contacts establishing operations preparing a business plan selecting professional advisors and consultants and seeking capital for the company          the company has limited operating history of its own and as such any prospective investor can only assess the company’s profitability or performance on a limited basis to date   because the company is an earlystage company with limited operating history it is impossible for an investor to assess the performance of the company or to determine whether the company will meet its projected business plan the company has limited financial results upon which an investor may judge its potential as a company that only recently emerged from the developmentstage the company may in the future still experience undercapitalization shortages setbacks and many of the problems delays and expenses encountered by any early stage business an investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the company management’s history and its projected operations in light of the risks expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by engaging in the company’s industry   the company has a correspondingly small financial and accounting organization being a public company may strain the companys resources divert management’s attention and affect its ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors   the company is an earlystage company with no developed finance and accounting organization and the rigorous demands of being a public company require a structured and developed finance and accounting group once it becomes a public reporting company the company will become subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  however the requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting legal and financial compliance costs which may be prohibitive to the company as it develops its business plan services and scope these costs have made and will continue to make some activities more difficult time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on its personnel systems and resources   the securities exchange act requires among other things that companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting in order to maintain the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting significant resources and management oversight are required as a result management’s attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on the development of the companys business financial condition and results of operations   these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for the company to obtain director and officer liability insurance if the company is unable to obtain adequate director and officer insurance its ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors especially those directors who may be deemed independent will be significantly curtailed   the company expects to incur additional expenses and may ultimately never be profitable   the company has only recently emerged from its status as a developmentstage company and it has limited operations to date the company will need to continue to generate revenue to achieve and maintain profitability to become profitable the company must successfully develop and operate its product sales and marketing business these processes involve many factors that are beyond the company’s control including the type of competition that the company may encounter ultimately in spite of the company’s best or reasonable efforts the company may never actually generate revenues sufficient to cover operating expenses or become profitable   the company may not be able to continue as a going concern   the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the company’s ability to fund future operations through additional financing from investors andor lenders or through the sale of its securities or through development of its operations due to these and other factors there is substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern          the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising a substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   in their audited financial report the company’s independent auditors have issued added an explanatory paragraph that unless the company is able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations andor obtain additional financing there is a substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern the company anticipates that it would need substantial capital over the next  months to continue as a going concern to expand its operations in accordance with its current business plan     no assurance of market acceptance   even if the company successfully markets sells and distributes technology products there can be no assurance that the market reception will be positive for the company or its ventures   the widespread adoption and use of the company’s wind turbine products will represent fundamental change in the energy industry as with any new technology there is a substantial risk that potential customers may not accept the potential benefits of the company’s products market acceptance of company’s products will depend in large part upon the ability of company to demonstrate the performance advantages and costeffectiveness of its products over competing products there can be no assurance that company will be able to market its technology successfully on a widespread basis or that any of company’s current or future products or services will be accepted in the marketplace furthermore company intends to develop products and systems and sell them at a price assumed by company sufficient to generate a profit even if company’s products and services are accepted in the industry the market for its products may not be able to support company’s pricing structure   reliance on third party agreements and relationships is necessary for development of the companys business   the company will need strong third party relationships and partnerships in order to develop and grow its business the company will be substantially dependent on these strategic partners and third party relationships to commercialize its business   the proposed operations of the company are speculative   the success of the proposed business plan of the company will depend to a great extent on the operations financial condition and management of the company although the company has a business plan and intends to execute its overall business strategy limited operations have been conducted to date and the proposed operations of the company remain speculative   executive officers directors and  shareholders of the company will retain voting control after the offering which will allow them to exert substantial influence over major corporate decisions   the company anticipates that its executive officers and directors together with  shareholders will in the aggregate beneficially own enough of its issued and outstanding capital stock following the completion of this offering assuming the sale of all shares hereby offered to exert voting control accordingly the present shareholders by virtue of their percentage share ownership and certain procedures established by the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the company for the election of its directors may effectively control the board of directors and the policies of the company as a result these stockholders will retain substantial control over matters requiring approval by the company’s stockholders such as without limitation the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company’s common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares   the company depends on its management team and employees to operate its business effectively   the companys future success is dependent in large part upon its ability to understand and develop the business plan and to attract and retain highly skilled management operational and executive personnel in particular due to the relatively early stage of the companys business its future success is highly dependent on its officers to provide the necessary experience and background to execute the companys business plan the loss of any officer’s services could impede particularly initially as the company builds a record and reputation its ability to develop its objectives particularly in its ability to develop commercialize and further its business and products          the company’s business also depends on its ability to attract and retain talented product marketing and sales professionals in the united states and in overseas territories any loss of key members of the team and the customer relationship associated with the member can impact the business significantly   government regulation could negatively impact the business   the company’s business segments may be subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate due to the potential wide scope of the company’s operations the company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities including various local and municipal agencies and government subdivisions the company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply the company’s operations could be adversely affected directly or indirectly by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry    the companys election not to opt out of jobs act extended accounting transition period may not make its financial statements easily comparable to other companies   pursuant to the jobs act of  as an emerging growth company the company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the pcaob or the sec the company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies the company as an emerging growth company can adopt the standard for the private company this may make comparison of the companys financial statements with any other public company which is not either an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used   the recently enacted jobs act will also allow the company to postpone the date by which it must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the sec   the recently enacted jobs act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on “emerging growth companies the company meets the definition of an emerging growth company and so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” it will among other things   be exempt from the provisions of section b of the sarbanesoxley act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting    be exempt from the “say on pay” provisions requiring a nonbinding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers and the “say on golden parachute” provisions requiring a nonbinding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations of the doddfrank act and certain disclosure requirements of the dodd frank act relating to compensation of its chief executive officer   be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the securities exchange act of  and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation and   be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report on the financial statements          although the company is still evaluating the jobs act it currently intends to take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an “emerging growth company” the company has elected not to opt out of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under section b of the jobs act among other things this means that the companys independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected likewise so long as it qualifies as an emerging growth company the company may elect not to provide certain information including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers that would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the sec which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the company as a result investor confidence in the company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected   the company may face significant competition from companies that serve its industries   the company’s business is highly competitive with respect to price quality assortment and presentation and customer service this competitive market creates the risk of adverse impact to the company’s revenues due to the potential need to reduce prices and thus reduce margins in order to stay competitive if the company fails to timely and effectively respond to competitive pressures and changes in the markets it could adversely affect the company’s financial performance   furthermore the company competes with firms who may have greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than the company and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers and employees and more successfully attract and retain customers the company may be vulnerable to the marketing power and degree of consumer recognition of these larger competitors the company is susceptible to the risk that its competitors could effectively venture into the company’s areas of expertise in which case the company may not be able to compete successfully and competitive pressures may adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition   pricing pressures may be significant in the company’s industry   because the market that the company intends to target is competitive and large in volume customers routinely ask for lower pricing to make their products more competitive this phenomenon can put pricing pressure on the company’s products and reduce profit margin over time   the company is subject to the potential factors of market and customer changes    the business of the company is susceptible to rapidly changing preferences of the marketplace and its customers the needs of customers are subject to constant change although the company intends to carry out its plan of developing and selling products and solutions to satisfy changing customer demands in the marketplace there can be no assurance that funds for such expenditures will be available or that the companys competition will not develop similar or superior capabilities or that the company will be successful in its internal efforts   the future success of the company will depend in part on its ability to respond effectively to rapidly changing trends industry standards and customer requirements   the development of new technology is a significant risk even though the company plans to invest in marketing and sales of leading technology products and services new technology may come to market that makes the company’s products obsolete and less attractive to customers    general economic factors may adversely affect the company’s financial performance   economic conditions beyond the company’s control such as increased unemployment levels inflation increases in fuel other energy costs and interest rates lack of available credit erosion in consumer confidence and other factors affecting disposable consumer income may adversely affect the company’s business many of those factors as well as commodity rates transportation costs costs of labor insurance and healthcare foreign exchange rate fluctuations lease costs changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors also affect the company’s cost of goods sold as well as its general and administrative expenses which may adversely affect sales or profitability          the company does not maintain certain insurance including errors and omissions and indemnification insurance   the company has limited capital and therefore does not currently have a policy of insurance against liabilities arising out of the negligence of its officers and directors andor deficiencies in any of its business operations even assuming that the company obtained insurance there is no assurance that such insurance coverage would be adequate to satisfy any potential claims made against the company its officers and directors or its business operations any such liability which might arise could be substantial and may exceed the assets of the company the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the company provide for indemnification of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons it is the opinion of the securities and exchange commission that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable   intellectual property andor trade secret protection may be inadequate    the company has applied for and received some intellectual property or trade secret protection in certain aspects of its business there can be no assurance that the current protection is adequate or that the company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or the introduction of substantially similar solutions and services   the technology and products that the company plans to market may be accused of infringing patents that the company its supplier and technology partner may not be aware of initially patents owners may take action to block the sale of such products which can impact sales of the company    high technology industries such as the energy industry in which the company operates are characterized by the existence of both an increasing number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement from time to time third parties may assert exclusive patent copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the company while there currently are no outstanding infringement claims pending by or against the company there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the company in the future that assertions by such parties will not result in costly litigation or that the company would prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents or copyrights from third parties on commercially reasonable terms any infringement claim or other litigation against or by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company   to date the company has relied on a combination of patent protection and trade secret methods of protecting its proprietary information there can be no assurance that those strategies will afford protection to that information and there can be no assurance that the patents for which it has applied if issued would provide the company with meaningful protection from competition furthermore there can be no assurance that the company’s products will not be found to infringe on any patent or other right held by others in the event that any such products or services are found to so infringe the company could be required to seek a license with respect to such patented technology if such a license is available or incur substantial costs to redesign the infringing products or services the occurrence of any of the foregoing events would likely have a material adverse effect on the company   the company may not be able to attract new customers or fuel its growth   the company hopes to grow its business by increasing sales and developing new products there can be no assurance however that the company will be able to successfully implement any of its growth strategies to successfully achieve growth the company must continually evaluate the adequacy of its existing systems and find new uses for its unique turbine there can be no assurance that the company will adequately anticipate all of the changing demands that growth should it occur will impose on the company’s systems procedures and structure any failure to adequately anticipate and respond to such changing demands is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company          if the company is unable to develop and introduce new products and improvements the company may be unable to compete in the marketplace     the market for the company’s wind turbine products is characterized by evolving industry requirements accordingly the company’s future performance depends on a number of factors including its ability to identify emerging technological trends in its target markets to develop and maintain competitive products to enhance its products by adding innovative features that differentiate the company’s products from those of its competitors and to manufacture and bring products to market quickly at costeffective prices there can be no assurance however that the company will successfully complete the development of any products that such products will achieve market acceptance that such products will receive regulatory approvals where required that any required regulatory approvals will be received in a timely manner or that such products can be produced at competitive prices or at all in the event that its products are not timely developed do not gain market acceptance or cannot be manufactured at competitive prices the company’s business could be materially adversely affected   investors in the offering will experience immediate dilution of the value of their shares   purchasers of the shares will experience immediate dilution in the value of their shares dilution represents the difference between the price per share paid by investors and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of the offering net tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the company total assets less total liabilities less intangible assets divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this prospectus the company’s net tangible per share book value was  thus if at some other time shares had been sold by the company at a price less than the  paid by purchasers of the shares or had been issued by the company for services or as other noncash consideration then the value of such investor shares immediately after purchase would be less than the purchase price the company has issued shares prior to the date of this prospectus at a price less than    risks associated with our common stock   the company’s stock price may be volatile   the market price of the company’s common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various potential factors many of which will be beyond the company’s control including the following     · competition   · additions or departures of key personnel   · the company’s ability to execute its business plan   · operating results that fall below expectations   · swcc certification per awea  standard   · loss of any strategic relationship   · industry developments   · economic and other external factors and   · periodtoperiod fluctuations in the company’s financial results   in addition the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies these market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of the company’s common stock   we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future   we do not intend to declare dividends for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that we will reinvest any future earnings in the development and growth of our business therefore investors will not receive any funds unless they sell their common stock and stockholders may be unable to sell their shares on favorable terms or at all we cannot assure you of a positive return on investment or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock          we may in the future issue additional shares of our common stock which would reduce investors’ ownership interests in the company and which may dilute our share value   our articles of incorporation and amendments thereto authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock par value  per share the future issuance of all or part of our remaining authorized common stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders we may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis the issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock       an active trading market for our common stock may never develop or be sustained   we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will develop in the future or if developed that any market will be sustained accordingly you may be required to hold your shares indefinitely or to sell them at a price that does not meet your expectations if at all   the company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any investment in the company’s stock will be considered a highrisk investment and subject to restrictions on marketability   if the shares commence trading the trading price of the companys common stock may be below  per share if the price of the common stock is below such level trading in its common stock would be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended these rules require additional disclosure by brokerdealers in connection with any trades generally involving any nonnasdaq equity security that has a market price of less than  per share subject to certain exceptions such rules require the delivery before any penny stock transaction of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated therewith and impose various sales practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and accredited investors generally institutions for these types of transactions the brokerdealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transactions before sale the additional burdens imposed upon brokerdealers by such requirements may discourage brokerdealers from effecting transactions in the company’s common stock which could impact the liquidity of the company’s common stock   finra sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock   the financial industry regulatory authority “finra” has adopted rules that relate to the application of the sec’s penny stock rules in trading our securities and require that a brokerdealer have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer prior to recommending the investment prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their noninstitutional customers brokerdealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status tax status investment objectives and other information   under interpretations of these rules finra believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers finra’s requirements make it more difficult for brokerdealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity and liquidity of our common stock further many brokers charge higher transactional fees for penny stock transactions as a result fewer brokerdealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock reducing a shareholder’s ability to resell shares of our common stock          there has been no prior public market for the company’s securities and the lack of such a market may make resale of the stock difficult   no prior public market has existed for the company’s securities and the company cannot assure any investor that a market will develop subsequent to this offering an

may be while this offering is still in process to qualify for quotation on the otc bulletin board an equity security must have one registered brokerdealer known as the market maker willing to list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company listing currently the company does not have an arrangement with any such market maker to qualify the company’s securities for quotation on the otc bulletin board moreover the company does not know if it will be successful in such application for quotation on the otc bulletin board how long such application will take or that if successful that a market for the common stock will ever develop or continue on the otc bulletin board if for any reason the common stock is not listed on the otc bulletin board or a public trading market does not

with transactions in penny stocks penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than  other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system   the penny stock rules require a brokerdealer prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the sec that     · contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading   · contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such duties   · contains a brief clear narrative description of a dealer market including “bid” and “ask” prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price   · contains a tollfree telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions   · defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks and   · contains such other information and is in such form including language type size and format as the sec shall require by rule or regulation   the

skywolf wind turbine corporation and the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this registration statement on form s this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our operating results financial conditions and liquidity and cashflow since inception          description of our business   company introduction   skywolf is the only company that sells a state of the art patented solar hybrid wind turbine system which is the ultimate renewable energy product finally an innovative solution that extracts energy from both wind and sun simultaneously or individually depending on which energy source is available in addition it can be installed almost anywhere usually requiring only local building permits our hybrid’s technology opens the door to affordable clean power throughout the world for homeowners farmers municipalities colleges minigrids prisons airports commercial properties and in particular undeveloped countries skywolf is committed to bringing renewable energy to third world countries with no viable options for electrical power wind and sun energy are endless resources available worldwide offering the best return on investment of any renewable energy in the market today     the solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine on site   corporate history and general information about the company   skywolf wind turbine corporation the “company” located at  court street geneseo new york  was incorporated under the laws of the state of new york on august   and was formerly known as brock renewable energy research  development corporation the company is the designer manufacturer and supplier of a patented solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine aka “the hybrid” which uses wind and solar energy sources combined in one unit the company has not filed for bankruptcy receivership or any similar proceedings nor is in the process of filing for bankruptcy receivership or any similar proceedings the company currently has six fulltime employeesconsultants along with several independent sales representatives the manufacturing facility and administrative offices are located in a single  sq ft building where products are developed manufactured marketed and sold along with feasibility studies to determine optimum site location          business and market summary   after six years of research and development that resulted in three patents skywolf made a major technological breakthrough with a patented diffused augmented wind turbine design dawt the dawt is capable of producing more energy output at lower wind speeds then conventional wind turbines and with a significantly smaller footprint by reducing static pressure behind its rotor blades the dawt has been shown to exponentially increase efficiency and electric energy output by  or more as compared to conventional wind turbines of the same size adding solar to the dawt resulted in another patent for a solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine aka hdawt or “hybrid” that gives skywolf a distinct advantage in the renewable energy market by harnessing wind and solar energy simultaneously skywolf’s design addresses the pitfalls and limitations of conventional wind turbines which represent a largely untapped market and a great business opportunity consumers with extremely rural or difficult sites or a varied mix of solarwind energy will greatly benefit from the hybrid design skywolf’s improvements over small to medium sized wind turbine competitors are listed below   · current height of competitors reduced from an average of  to sky wolfs    o no faa permit required for skywolf only a normal building permit   o skywolf only requires  ft   instead of  ft   acre   · the fan blades are enclosed in a shroud with skywolf which    o results in substantial noise reduction   o eliminates sun flutter from large rotating blades   o removes the liability of ice flying off fan blades and causing injury   o dramatically reduces bird deaths   · skywolf reduces site issues because   o increased wind speed range makes more sites viable   o  height is like a tree hence much less visually challenging   o the small shroud containing the blades looks appealing   o it can be erected on any approved building lot   o maintenance is simple and cost effective at  no massive crane required   · skywolf dramatically increases efficiency and    o expands the operational wind speed range from    mph to    mph   o extracts at least  more power out of wind to make it much more affordable             · adding solar expands the number of usable sites and increases energy output   the void in this market segment provides a unique opportunity that can only be filled by skywolf setting the stage for substantial market penetration and subsequent sales the most promising aspect of skywolf’s technology lies in the expansion of new sales from customers that are dissatisfied with the current limitations of conventional wind turbines only our hybrid can extract both wind and solar energy simultaneously to give each customer the maximum amount of usable power every day regardless of site location or weather each hybrid unit comes with a complete integrated system that captures converts and monitors wind and solar energy production which can be gridtied or connected into a battery based system offgrid our product is patent protected and is the only unit in the market that combines wind and solar in a unique and innovative design the unique properties of the hybrid gives consumers an alternative to larger and less efficient wind turbines andor oversized solar arrays the added benefit of solar panels incorporated into our hybrid design allows the generation of power over a broader range of conditions our competitive price point perfectly positions the hybrid nationally and internationally in the energy market additional state and federal tax credits assist in the sale and value of our hybrid in the us market the company has secured sales in new york state in both the agricultural and residential markets plus preliminary negotiations are underway in colombia south america south africa peru mexico and europe totaling  billion dollars or more in potential sales   the business windsolar hybrid turbines for renewable energy generation   we believe that the renewable energy sector is stronger than ever in fact renewables outperformed all other sources of new electricity over the past five years and garnered more than  billion is us investment in  currently the us is severely dependent on carbon based fuels for energy as shown in the table below the volatility of fossil fuel prices combined with negative environmental effects caused by pollution have spurred the development of a substantial market for solar and wind renewable energy we believe that the negative effects of pollution coupled with fluctuating costs and uncertain supply associated with the generation of energy from fossil fuel sources has increased the demand for renewable energy sources               one of the concerns with renewable energy is the low efficiency associated with converting to electrical power in addition the supply of these renewable energies is not consistent with the demand and the consistency of electrical energy output as it is currently produced and consumed solar panels can be utilized but the size of land area required to produce sufficient energy output is extremely large in addition locating panels on rooftops will decay the roof structure and provide unsightly visual appearance conventional wind turbines have been developed as an alternative but the expansive footprint required by conventional wind turbines designs as high as  to  feet with large rotor diameters up to  feet require extensive installation costs in contrast our hybrid requires a much smaller footprint to produce the same amount of energy   conventional wind turbines power generation and footprint     we believe that skywolf made a major technological breakthrough with its hybrid design the reduction in size and jump in efficiency with the hybrid eliminates several problems associated with wind turbines such as visual effects noise bird deaths and cost skywolfs unique design opens up the market to residential areas small businesses farms schools and municipalities which we believe is an undersold market of approximately  million potential customers the introduction of skywolf’s hybrid to the green energy market will completely change the path to energy independence this advanced technology opens the door to affordable clean power throughout the world          we are currently in the market commercialization and business development phase of our product where we are executing market strategies and commercialization by attending key conferences and tradeshows sponsored by new york power authority nypa and suny sustainability as well as advertising in the new york state association counties nysac magazine as new orders are secured expansion will require additional staff resources and additional facility site we intend to participate in several government programs to offset this expansion cost and effectively assist our growth   the marketplace   the capacity for alternative energy has been growing at a significant rate wind power in the us is now the largest source of renewable generating capacity and has provided  of all new capacity installed over the past five years wind power provided  of electricity generating capacity added to the us system in  within the us there are now  states that have over  mw of installed capacity those states are texas iowa oklahoma california kansas illinois minnesota oregon washington colorado north dakota indiana new york michigan wyoming pennsylvania nebraska and new mexico another  states have  mw to  mw of wind power capacity  states produce between  to  of their electricity with wind power  states produce over  and another  states produce over  the us has approximately  of its power supplied by wind as of the end of  and is on a clear path to increase its energy independence utilizing wind power along with other sources of green energy          us wind power capacity installations by state awea  market report     us wind power capacity

industrial technology which covers the manufacturing and energy sectors exhibiting at this fair connected us to approximately  attendees from  countries comprised of  business delegations in addition we have received strong interest from companies located in other regions such as africa mexico afghanistan and asia we are also in discussion with a manufacturer located in china that will allow fabrication sales and delivery of our products to that region   our products solar hybrid wind diffused augmented wind turbine    the basic premise of a wind turbine is to extract energy out of airflow which is created by the unequal heating of the earth wind turbines convert the kinetic energy from wind into mechanical power that runs a generator when wind blows past a turbine the blades capture energy and rotate this rotation triggers an internal shaft to spin which is connected to a gearbox that is connected to a generator ultimately producing electricity   the skywolf hybrid model has six turbine blades mounted for rotation about a longitudinal axis on a rotating hub ideally the blade length will extend almost all the way to the inner side of the front diffuser which surrounds the blades the shape is conical and has an upstream and downstream opening a backside section extends from the front diffuser and is used to assemble the parts used to enhance airflow because the plates are discontinuous there are gaps between adjacent plates consequently the air exiting the downstream opening and air moving through the axial air passage under the plates are mixed and a portion of the mixed air exits through the gaps pulling air outward from the interior airflow path reduces pressure behind the rotor blades which increases air flow and enhances the extraction of kinetic energy from the air path the plates are tilted away from the axis of rotation of the blades which allows the wind turbine to turn into the direction of the wind and helps boost extraction efficiency in order to fully optimize the extraction of wind energy a special rotor blade was designed specifically for skywolfs wind turbine each blade design option         blades was methodically tested utilizing a campbell scientific cr data logger with a certified awea anemometer before establishing  blades was the optimum design for our wind turbine   prototype diffused augmented wind turbine design            in  the idea and design to include solar panels in replacement of the directional plates optimized the ability to capture both wind and solar renewable energies this breakthrough in design led to the introduction in late  of eight bifacial solar panels to give us our current skywolf solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine aka hdawt or hybrid model    current solar hybrid diffused augmented wind turbine hdawt design     in order to fully optimize the extraction of kinetic energy from wind skywolf has designed four critical parts listed below that operate as a single highly efficient system     · the forward diffuser made from polypropylene wwoven glass fiber channels the air flow into the specially designed light weight cast aluminum turbine blades and augments the wind through the bifacial solar panels that allow for rotation at speeds as low as  mph and up to  mph   · a carbon steel housing pivot hub with tempered steel pivot shaft and heavy duty conical roller bearings greased constantly positions the turbine in the head wind   · the addition of eight bifacial solar panels collects solar energy on both surfaces while continuously aligning turbine with head wind and   · the attached back section incorporates a design that pulls additional air away from the interior air path and prevents a stall point so air can flow freely   the hybrid has been designed as a simple modular system which is shipped in ’ ocean freight containers directly to the jobsite eliminating the need for expensive temporary storage the product is listed under naic  and sic    each unit includes control panels used to capture the electrical energy produced interface with ac invert dc to ac tie it into the grid provide safety control and continually monitor the wind turbine at the site a typical control panel layout is depicted below         control panel     a power curve measures the usable power extracted from wind at all of the various wind speeds experienced by a wind turbine          power curve             conventional wind turbines extract usable power in the range of  to  mph while skywolfs range is    mph which creates a significant increase in total output power representative power curves are shown for both types of wind turbines in the above graph because skywolf’s hybrid is extremely more efficient at extracting power from wind each data point represents more power than conventional wind turbines can extract however there is a dramatic gain in output power above  mph which often happens during storms and shifts in pressure fronts consequently skywolf’s product does not have the limitations experienced by traditionally designed wind turbines and produces usable power over the entire range of    mph this is only achievable by skywolf and dramatically differentiates our product from our competitors in the marketplace   intellectual property and patents awarded   skywolf holds the following patents which have been issued by the us patent and trademark office uspto   · “high efficiency wind turbine having increased laminar air flow” us  b issued march     · “multiple mixing internal external fluid driven high efficiency wind turbine having reduced downstream pressure” us  b issued may     · “high efficiency wind turbine including photovoltaic cells” us  b issued october     · “housing for a high efficiency wind turbine” us  b issued april     skywolf also has the following patent pending   · “multiple mixing internal external fluid driven high efficiency wind turbine having reduced downstream pressure” international patent application us receipt date april     product development   the design and testing for the current kw solar hybrid hdawt is complete and the company is in the design phase for releasing an additional model which features a kw generator design and testing of the larger size unit are proceeding and the extent of design changes are expected to be minimal consequentially the company expects this model to be available later this year the company believes that by introducing a larger scale model of the hybrid it will be well positioned to expand sales into market segments requiring more energy   pricing   the company anticipates offering its products at an average sales price of  in quantities of  which we believe is a marketcompetitive price quantity discounts are available for   and  size orders given the small physical size efficient energy output and ease of installation with no additional guide wires our products are competitive with similar turbines however as sales volumes increase cost savings of    will be anticipated and passed on to customers through price reductions which will stimulate sales   competition   we currently do not compete with wind turbine manufacturers such as ge and siemens who sell large  foot to  foot wind turbine structures commonly utilized on new commercial wind farm applications on the other hand we do compete against small to medium wind turbine manufacturers such as bergey eocycle endurance and kingspan who manufacture wind turbines for residential and commercial markets however other than our hybrid there is no other competing technology in the world that combines both wind and solar in one turbine giving us a very distinctive advantage           the following is a list of companies that may directly compete with skywolf for the kw market   manufacturer   models rated capacity       ac green energy   talon kw bergey windpower   bwc xl kw bwc excel kw bwc excel kw eocycle   eo and eo

market share four of the remaining companies have good market penetration and experience in the wind turbine business and stand out as primary competition for skywolf bergey kingspan and xzeres have been instrumental in developing wind power and introducing it to the market without them wind power would probably not have developed to the current level however both companies as well as the others have peaked out developmentwise and are experiencing less and less return on each engineering dollar spent most of bergey kingspan and xzeress sales are based on brand length of time in the business and the lack of alternatives in the market place at this juncture it would take a bold step forward for them to make a significant impact in this technology skywolf’s hybrid design is unique and stands alone in the industry and marketplace since it’s the only patented wind turbine manufacturer to achieve energy generation from both wind and solar sources   strategic partners and suppliers   the company believes that strategic partnerships will be a major component of the company’s operating strategy and path to success currently several strategic partnerships include our solar panel turbine generator and proprietary control panel equipment supplier these relationships provide critical services and products that assist skywolf with proposals and solutions that help secure business

domestically and internationally the hybrid represents a high tech commercial product that is sold typically through a solicitation or procurement by a state of work sow or request for proposals rfp from larger institutions   sales and marketing   the company has executed its initial market commercialization strategies in advertising and marketing starting in september  however since the primary focus of the company since inception has been to obtain all of the primary patents and finalize a design the current marketing strategy continues to evolve as products enter the marketplace our initial sales channel will be direct sales and through targeted tradeshows and industry conferences additional sales engineers and market managers will be hired to target these specific market segments and territories therefore the company is starting to obtain and identify key independent representation with preexisting contacts in globally expanding markets that desperately need renewable energy the company will monitor initial sales ensuring a smooth transition into the market has been established before implementing the full sales plan          the commercial launch of skywolf’s hybrid began with a review and research of impacting energy associations conferences municipal partners tradeshows and government agencies that impact monitor or utilize renewable energy technologies to introduce and increase our product exposure we have elected to participate attend and partner with several targeted organizations as follows   government agencies   the following governmental agencies govern establish and promote renewable energy technologies in new york state we have relied upon certain initiatives and programs implemented by these agencies such as eo  and the new york state clean energy standard to assist in the development of our business and identify key sales channels     municipal partners conferences and trade shows   recently there is a rapid initiative for counties to establish alternative energy resources for their communities with escalating utility costs skywolf plans to join the new york state association of counties nysac as well as place advertisements in their quarterly news magazine that provides us access to  counties and  members in county government   skywolf has strategically targeted specific tradeshows that will highlight our product and provide maximum exposure to key markets industries and decision makers nypa has recently established a build smart program which holds an annual innovation summit that allowed skywolf to showcase their new hybrid in addition the state university new york suny holds an annual sustainability conference that provided skywolf with the connection of  college universities looking to establish sustainable programs            market strategy map     market developments clearly articulate a huge demand for renewable energy combined with increased government programs and requirements for sustainable energy and provide a large market opportunity for new technology products skywolf is well positioned to sell its hybrid to meet this demand in review of this marketplace our core

offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding  million and   exemption from registration by a nonreporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to  that comply with rules to be adopted by the sec pursuant to section  of the securities act and exemption of such sales from state law registration documentation or offering requirements   in general under the jobs act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering ipo of common equity securities was effected after december   and the company had less than  billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year a company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of   i the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of  billion or more   ii the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the companys ipo   iii the companys issuance of more than  billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior threeyear period or   iv the company becoming a larger accelerated filer as defined under the securities exchange act of    the jobs act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for nonreporting companies and for nonpublic offerings those exemptions that impact the company are discussed below   financial disclosure the financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the securities act of  will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows   i audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years   ii selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited   iii executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies          a smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than  million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter   however the requirements for financial disclosure provided by regulation sk promulgated by the rules and regulations of the sec already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies the company is a smaller reporting company currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations   the jobs act also exempts the companys independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the public company accounting oversight board pcaob after the date of the jobs acts enactment except as otherwise required by sec rule   the jobs act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the pcaob for mandatory rotation of the companys accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit   internal control attestation the jobs act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the companys independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the companys internal control over financial reporting although management of the company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the companys internal control over financial reporting   section a of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §ae of the securities exchange act of  for companies with a class of securities registered under the  act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes   other items of the jobs act the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement the act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision in addition the jobs act precludes the sec and finra from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers dealers and potential investors communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company ipo   section  of the jobs act permits emerging growth companies to submit  act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least  days before the issuer conducts any road show this is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the ipo option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow   election to opt out of transition period section b of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies that is those that have not had a  act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the  act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard   the jobs act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable the company has elected not to opt out of the transition period          plan of operation   business plan   the company is an earlystage company starting to generate sales and revenue by implementing its market commercialization strategies to continue to design develop market manufacture and sell its hybrid wind turbine in regional national and international markets   in the future the company plans to increase revenue and raise capital to support its plan of operations the company also plans to raise capital under this offering and use the proceeds of to obtain certification by the small wind certification council swcc and european ce marking add additional staff required to grow the company including positions in sales marketing and administration working capital and to fund research and development activities to create new applications such as a hydro unit   from the beginning the company has adopted a cash basis policy to ensure no debt would accumulate and leverage the developing business terms of our orders include a  down payment which is used to pay for all of the parts required to fill the order  payment is required upon shipment of the order and the remaining  is paid by our customers when the wind turbine is deemed operational gross profits are between  to  per unit and the overhead costs for the current business model is minimal  annually since all vendors are paid in full from opening order deposits overhead still needs to be covered and with normal delays in startup due to issues with shipping construction and weather further taking into account cancelled orders and some startup issues due to a defective part we project that we need to sell at least approximately  units per year in order to meet our annual businesses expenses   potential revenue   we

accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods   we regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements in general managements estimates are based on historical experience on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances actual results could differ from those estimates made by management   use of estimates – the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash – for financial statement presentation purposes the company considers all shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts which at times may exceed federallyinsured limits the company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk as a result of any nonperformance by the financial institution   inventory – inventory consists of completed turbines and unassembled parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market value the company capitalizes applicable direct and indirect costs incurred in inventory production          property and equipment – property and equipment consists of software and equipment depreciation is recorded on accelerated methods over periods considered by management to be the assets useful lives expenditures for repairs minor items and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred any gain or loss upon sale or retirement due to obsolescence is recorded in operating results in the period it takes place software is being depreciated over three years and equipment is being depreciated over five years   impairment of longlived assets – longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset including its ultimate disposition if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value of the asset fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the asset   fair value of financial instruments – the carrying value of cash prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value due to their short maturity the carrying value of loans from the principal shareholder depends on the companys ability to generate cash   revenue recognition – revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a service or product has been provided to a customer  the sale price to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and  collection of the sale price is reasonably assured amounts collected prior to satisfying these conditions are recorded as customer deposits   allowance for doubtful accounts – as of december   and  there are no anticipated bad debts so an allowance for doubtful accounts was not recorded   advertising costs – advertising costs are expensed when incurred advertising costs were  and  for the years ended  and  respectively and are included in other general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations   research and development costs – all costs of research and development are charged to operations as incurred research and development costs consist of expenses for inventing and testing turbine prototypes including the materials and other direct costs of constructing prototype turbines as well as related equipment employed in research and development activity   income taxes – the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities this method uses statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment deferred assets are recognized net of any valuation allowance for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax expense for a year is the net change in that years deferred asset and liability balances   the company has a deferred tax asset for potential future tax savings of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards however due to the uncertainty of future profits to absorb the carryforwards an equal valuation allowance reduces the value of the deferred tax asset to zero   deferred revenue – customer deposits – the company has received  in deposits for sales orders that are in process as of december     basic and diluted loss per share – basic earnings or loss per share reflect the weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share are computed including the additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares option or warrant shares for example

disclosures under us gaap financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern except in limited circumstances financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting the going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities currently us gaap lacks guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization’s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures this asu provides guidance to an organization’s management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes the amendments are effective for annual

policies   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accrual basis of accounting which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the

liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   cash – for financial statement presentation purposes the company considers all shortterm highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts which at times may exceed federallyinsured limits the company believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk as a result of any nonperformance by the financial institution   inventory – inventory consists of completed turbines and unassembled parts and is stated at the lower of cost or market value the company capitalizes applicable direct and indirect costs incurred in inventory production   property and equipment – property and equipment consists of software and equipment

being depreciated over five years     f         skywolf wind turbine corp notes to financial statements march   and december     note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   impairment of longlived assets – longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset including its ultimate disposition if such assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value of the asset fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values depending on the nature of the asset   fair value of financial instruments – the carrying value of cash prepaid expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value due to their short maturity the carrying value of loans from the principal shareholder depends on the companys ability to generate cash   revenue recognition – revenue is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a service or product has been provided to a customer  the sale price to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable and  collection of the sale price is reasonably assured amounts collected prior to satisfying these conditions are recorded as customer deposits   allowance for doubtful accounts – as of march   and december   there are no anticipated bad debts therefore an allowance for doubtful accounts was not

of research and development are charged to operations as incurred research and development costs consist of expenses for inventing and testing turbine prototypes including the materials and other direct costs of constructing prototype turbines as well as related equipment employed in research and development activity   income taxes – the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach that requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities this method uses statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and gives immediate effect to changes in income tax rates upon enactment deferred assets are recognized net of any valuation allowance for temporary differences and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred income tax expense for a year is the net change in that years deferred asset and liability balances     f        skywolf wind turbine corp notes to financial statements march   and december     note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   the company has a deferred tax asset for potential future tax savings of its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards however due to the uncertainty of future profits to absorb the carryforwards an equal valuation allowance reduces the value of the deferred tax asset to zero   deferred revenue – customer deposits – the company has received  in deposits for sales orders that are in process   basic and diluted loss per share – basic earnings or loss per share reflect the weighted average of shares issued and outstanding during the period diluted earnings per share are computed including the additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares option or warrant shares for example were issued no dilutive potential shares exist

under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern except in limited circumstances financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting the going concern basis of accounting is critical to financial reporting because it establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities currently us gaap lacks guidance about management responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the organization’s ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures this asu provides guidance to an organization’s management with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing are content of
