lot easier to launch work that matters” “successful people are the ones who are breaking the rules “ “the reason they want you to fit in… is that once you do then they can ignore you “the status quo is leaving the building and quickly” “you can raise the bar or you can wait for others to raise it but it’s getting raised regardless “ “you don’t have to settle it’s a choice you get to make every day” passion “if there was ever a moment to follow your passion and do work that matters this is it” “if you have no wish how can it possibly come true “ relationships “a long walk and calm conversation are an incredible combination if you want to build a bridge” “be with the ones you love and the ones that love you ignore everyone else” “you can be right or you can have empathy you can’t do both” strategy “don’t have any meetings about your web strategy just do stuff first you have to fail then you can improve “ “put aside your need for a stepbystep manual and instead realize

gifts that change lives  comments hi i tried hard even pulled out most of my remaining hair but coudn’t get the profound meaning of the quote – “if you could do tomorrow over again would you” if you could explain it over again would you 😉 thanks ps a phenomenal collection seth godin is not just a management guru… he is a life guru   gaurav — my take is that it’s a play on the idea that we always wish we had a do over well tomorrow hasn’t happened yet will it be the day you want it to be or will it be yet another day that you wish you could do over what if instead we got intentional and made the most of our tomorrow through a little bit of mindful planning and clarity of what we want … and then actually do it when the opportunity of tomorrow presents itself yes i like when people blend work and life and live their values i think work is a great place for selfexpression and an arena for growth and greatness good day jd man you loaded this post with some goodies bud i had read a

too seriously  bryan — he makes reading a pleasure with his precision and twists with words  samantha — i think that’s the real power of quotes just like a powerful song it’s an input but ultimately we make it meaningful to our situation and it can be a great inspiration hi jd  he’s always worth reading  he’s pithy and relevant and can jab you in the ribs to jog your memory … pithy and pertinent  practises what he preaches  cheers – hilary  hilary — perfect phrasing … pithy and pertinent … seth’s quotes … … seth godin quotes – sources of insight … … believe that not making a single doublefault
