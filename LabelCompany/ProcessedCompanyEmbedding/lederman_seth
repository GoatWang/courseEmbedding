referred to as atease have been reported at medical conferences in  on december   fda awarded tnx  sl breakthrough therapy designation for ptsd because its effects in militaryrelated ptsd have the potential to be improvements over existing therapies  tnx sl is believed to improve sleep quality in ptsd before focusing on ptsd tonix developed tnx sl for fibromyalgia including a phase a study that included sleep eegs whereas fibromyalgia is associated with a sleep disturbance confined to nonrem sleep ptsd is associated with impaired nonrem and rem sleep tnx disulfiram  mgselegiline  mg tablets for the treatment of alcohol abuse and addiction is in preclinical development tnx tianeptine tablets for ptsd is in preclinical development tnx is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine currently there is no tianeptinecontaining product approved in the us but tianeptine sodium amorphous has been marketed in europe asia and latin america for the treatment of depression since  tonix has discovered a novel salt and polymorph which may provide improved stability consistency and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine like cyclobenzaprine tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the inhibitory neuroplasticity observed during periods of stress and steroid use it is a weak muopioid receptor mor agonist but does not have significant affinity for known neurotransmitter receptors tianeptine has an established safety profile based on its decades of use in many european asian and latin american countries tnx is being developed as a first line monotherapy for ptsd for daytime dosing tnx is a new potential vaccine for smallpox tnx is a synthetic form of horsepox which is an otherwise extinct virus evolutionary analysis of modern vaccines indicates that the vaccine isolated and used by dr edward jenner to vaccinate against smallpox was either horsepox or something quite similar the synthesis of horsepox was a collaboration with professor david evans and dr ryan noyce at the university of alberta in edmonton alberta canada tnx or horsepox is the first poxvirus or poxviridae to be synthesized and provides a platform for developing new vaccines against infectious disease and cancer

with dr seth lederman president and ceo of tonix pharmaceuticals sleep disorder treatment an interview with dr seth lederman president and ceo of tonix pharmaceuticals download pdf copy interview conducted by april cashingarbutt ba hons cantabaugust   please could you give a brief introduction to sleep disorders and who they affect sleep disorders are a large area we are focused on one particular type of sleep disturbance called “nonrestorative” sleep people with this problem do sleep but they don’t wake up feeling refreshed or feeling that their sleep has had the restorative effects of healthy sleep to put this into context with all of the different sleep disorders it is important to note that most sleep disorders are classified as insomnia most insomnia is a problem with the quantity of sleep non restorative sleep is a problem with the quality of sleep sleep quantity and sleep quality are different we are focused on improving the quality of sleep for people with nonrestorative sleep people suffer from nonrestorative sleep for a number of reasons we are particularly focused on patients with fibromyalgia syndrome fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome patients with fibromyalgia hurt all over their bodies they also can’t get restorative sleep there is a vicious cycle of chronic pain and nonrestorative sleep pain disturbs sleep and people with nonrestorative pain have a greater sensitivity to pain and more trouble extinguishing pain while sleep quality and sleep quantity are different no one can get good quality sleep if they don’t get enough sleep one reason that nonrestorative sleep is so prevalent in our modern society is that people did not evolve to function on so little sleep less than a hundred years ago the vast majority of humans were awake when it was light outside and slept when it was dark in areas away from the equator in winter people slept more than  hours a night it is challenging for people to adapt to sleeping less and less a good night’s sleep for most people is around  hours but many people have to get by on  hours or less one of the reasons that people sleep so little is because there is so much artificial light and so much nighttime stimulation keeping them awake like television and the internet for people with nonrestorative sleep the first thing i like to advise them is ‘give sleep a chance’ many people in the field refer to this as “sleep hygiene” in the same way that people should wash their hands to remove germs they should pay attention to get enough good quality sleep to avoid the consequences of poor sleep another modern problem with sleep quality that is just about  or  years old is the jet lag people suffer as a consequence of the widespread use of airplanes and the challenges that people face in trying to adjust to timezone changes most people can recover from jet lag if they take care to give sleep a chance however some people can’t easily recover from jet leg and in these people jet lag can trigger a series of events that can become a downward spiral into worse and worse sleep problems these people are not able to recover from jet lag because they can’t get restorative sleep even if they spend time in bed staring at the ceiling when someone can get sleep and recover from jet lag then i call it compensation when someone is unable to back on track i think of their problem as decompensation once someone has decompsenated their inability to get restorative sleep can lead to other problems one of the most important challenges to getting good quality sleep is the fact that the body changes over time and people can’t always adjust their sleep hygiene to the changes in their bodies as they grow older young people can get away with much less sleep than older people women find menopause challenging because sweating and hot flashes lead to sleepless nights when people begin to experience chronic problems sleeping the body is able initially to compensate and maintain health despite poor sleep however if the sleep problem continues for a long time at some point the body becomes unable to compensate this progression leads to a vicious cycle where nonrestorative sleep leads to pain and pain leads to further difficulty sleeping why is a good night’s sleep so important sleep is an active process it is not a time when the brain is inactive it is a time when the brain is actively processing information from the day  storing certain experiences into memory but also editing other experiences so that they will be excluded from the repertoire of frequently recalled memories it is during restorative sleep that painful memories are edited for healthy people with restorative sleep this means that they won’t get fixated on reliving painful memories for people with nonrestorative sleep these painful memories can be recalled and they can become psychological fixations that become nightmares during sleep and resurface during awake hours and can be troubling for days weeks months or years another very important aspect of restorative sleep is that it refreshes the body’s system for perceiving and processing pain healthy people who experience an athletic injury or some other sort of painful event can wake up from a night of restorative sleep with the pain significantly diminished healthy people also find that a good night’s sleep restores the body’s ability to perceive and process pain even before the injury is repaired their bodies have a mechanism that operates during restorative sleep to adapt to pain and to work around it however people who are unable to get restorative sleep frequently cannot reset the body’s processes that perceive and process pain their pain can accumulate from day to day over time their pain swamps the system they become unable to adapt to pain or to work around it the mechanism by which the body can turn off or extinguish pain is called “central inhibition” extreme examples of central inhibition’s capabilities have been described when a rock has pinned the arm of a mountain climber or a when soldier’s limb is severely damaged by a blast or shell central inhibition is the process that allows the brain to turn off perception of pain from such injured limbs central inhibition in such extreme cases kicks in when there’s no hope for the body to avoid further pain and when continuing to perceive pain is counterproductive fibromyalgia seems to be connected with a problem in central pain because fibromyalgia patients experience pain all over their bodies despite the fact that it’s counterproductive in healthy people central inhibition can extinguish local pain perception connected with severe local injuries in fibromyalgia central inhibition seems to fail at a higher level because their pain is widespread almost the opposite of central inhibition is called “phantom limb” syndrome when people experience pain from limbs that have been amputated some cases of phantom limb or physical pain result in a spreading of the pain to other parts of the body that were not part of the original injury these cases seem to illustrate the processes that cause fibromyalgia in fact some fibromyalgia cases begin with a physical injury for example rheumatologists believe that the artist frida kahlo suffered from fibromyalgia and that her problems began with a back injury one of the our company’s important long term goals is to provide a medicine that helps people get back the ability to get a restful night’s sleep on their own we don’t know if our existing medicine tnx sl will have this capability or if it will require better understanding of sleep and the development of second or even third generation sleep quality products it might be helpful to regard such a medicine using the metaphor of a crutch if someone can’t walk because of a temporary injury a crutch can help until they can walk again on their own we hope that our efforts will lead to a bedtime medicine can help improve the quality of sleep in patients who can’t get restorative sleep until the time when these patients can sleep normally again on their own whatever processes are going on in the brains and bodies of fibromyalgia patients all we can hope to do with tnx sl is get them back to the point of being able to get restorative sleep and allowing sleep’s natural restorative processes to work on reducing pain we hope that it will refresh their ability to process pain what do patients currently use to try to get to sleep people who have trouble getting restorative sleep often learn from their life experiences that they feel better all over if they are able to get a night of restful sleep since people who have trouble getting restorative sleep frequently suffer with chronic pain from fibromyalgia or ptsd they often learn that their pain improves if they are able to get a night of restful sleep for people who experience this kind of relief getting a night of restorative sleep can become an allconsuming quest it may even take over their lives they may risk other consequences in order to achieve it for this reason many chronic pain patients turn to prescription sleep drugs in the hopes of getting restorative sleep these medicines may work once twice or for a short period but unfortunately prescription sleep drugs increase only the quantity of sleep they do not increase the quality of sleep people who turn to prescription sleep drugs may become dependent upon them and not get the benefit that they are really seeking in a reliable way in fact dependence on prescription sleep drugs is one of the reasons why people cannot get restorative sleep our program is heading in a completely different direction as we’re trying to help people get increased sleep quality not necessarily increasing sleep quantity alcohol is probably the most common nonprescription chemical that people use to help them sleep men typically use alcohol more frequently than women and men seem to have a higher predisposition for selfmedicating using alcohol alcohol has some ability to work as a sedative unfortunately alcohol fragments sleep and does not help to improve sleep quality another feature of alcohol is that it exerts an effect that is fairly shortacting and not longlasting if someone uses alcohol to help them go to sleep at pm at night it is not uncommon for them to wake up at am or am more activated than if they had not taken alcohol from a drugdesigner’s perspective alcohol does not have the right pharmacokinetic profile to be an effective sleep medicine since people wake up activated in the middle of the night obviously alcohol also has other issues for example only small amounts of alcohol have any beneficial effects if someone drinks too much alcohol then there are other consequences drinking more alcohol to try to extend the time that it acts as a sedative is a dangerous and unhealthy proposition tonix pharmaceuticals have recently announced that they have a promising new drug under development for treating fibromyalgia and the sleep problems that come with this condition please could you tell us a little bit about this drug and what are its benefits over traditional sleep drugs we’re working on a new type of sleep quality medicine that is a sublingual tablet which patients will take at bedtime under their tongue it is designed to improve the quality of sleep we are focusing on two indications fibromyalgia and ptsd our lead indication is for patients with fibromyalgia fibromyalgia is a pain syndrome that affects mostly women approximately  of fibromyalgia patients are women and only approximately  are men our second indication is for people with ptsd ptsd affects a significant number of the soldiers returning from deployments in afghanistan and before that from iraq in the united states fibromyalgia affects approximately  million people it is a chronic pain syndrome that is characterized by chronic widespread pain and it can frequently take over the life of the patient the patient may have trouble working trouble with normal daily activities trouble maintaining social relationships this is because the pain caused by fibromyalgia becomes so pervasive we have evidence from our phase iia study which is a study on  patients with fibromyalgia that bedtime treatment with a primitive version of our product resulted in improved sleep quality and decreased pain from fibromyalgia related storieschronic lack of sleep reduces cognitive abilities negatively impacts physical healthurbanization and electrification of homes not linked to sleep lossfirst of its kind day hera mission incorporates sleep reduction for research purposeswe’re excited to move forward with the development of our product and we will be starting a phase iii efficacy study in the first quarter of  our ptsd program is not as advanced as our fibromyalgia program so we anticipate that we will start enrolling into a proofofconcept study early in  in ptsd we are testing a similar hypothesis to fm people with ptsd have difficulty sleeping and many of them experience chronic widespread pain we believe that by improving the quality of sleep they will experience less pain please could you tell us how this drug has been developed the discovery of the effects of our drug all began with dr iredell iglehart who is a rheumatologist in baltimore in private practice dr iglehart started experimenting with patients in his practice using low doses of a prescription drug that is already available called flexeril® which is the merck brand name for cyclobenzaprine dr iglehart realized that low doses of cyclobenzaprine given  hours before bedtime resulted in an improvement in patients with fibromyalgia patients noticed the benefit initially after several days of dosing but the benefit could be sustained for long periods of time dr iglehart’s results and his treatment paradigm were radically different from what people had seen before some other clinical scientists had experimented on fibromyalgia patients with cyclobenzaprine but they used larger doses of cyclobenzaprine and they dosed it during the day we suspect that the higher doses and the daytime dosing are why the effects that were seen by other investigators were fairly shortterm and were lost with chronic treatment in contrast dr iglehart used lower doses  hours before bedtime and his patients got benefits that seemed more frequent and had more durable clinical responses after dr iglehart’s discovery we applied medical and pharmaceutical science to the program to make an improved product because it is very difficult for any patient to be disciplined enough to take a medicine  or  hours before they are planning to go to sleep we recognized that if we could have a fastacting product it would be a significant advantage for patients also we hoped to design a product with faster clearance of the drug from the bloodstream so the patient would not be hungover the next morning – which is a sideeffect of using the currently available cyclobenzaprine products offlabel at bedtime we started with dr iglehart’s discovery but we have taken it a long way through pharmaceutical development we are now at the point where we have an elegant sublingual tablet that has characteristics that are not available by taking the currently available cyclobenzaprine products at what stage of drug development are you currently at the short answer is that we are phase iii ready we are on track to begin the first of two phase iii studies in the first quarter of  the first phase iii study will involve  subjects in each of two groups  patients will get our new medicine which is called tnx sl where sl stands for sublingual  patients will get a placebo it will be a doubleblind randomized placebo controlled study and we should have the patients enrolled studied and finished with the protocol and the data analyzed before the end of  when do you think that the drug will be available for patients our current plan projects that we will have the fda approved product in the first quarter of  it’s a conservative plan and we hope to beat our own projected timelines by perhaps a quarter however getting a prescription drug approved in the us is not a simple process and we are going to apply the most rigorous scientific testing to meet the hurdles set by the fda and to address the natural skepticism of the doctors and patients we believe that scientific evidence is the best way to advance the field and to convince doctors and patients to try our product and to adopt our product if they find it beneficial is this drug only for patients with fibromyalgia or will it be available for patients with other conditions that cause sleeping difficulties our first product will be exclusively tested in fibromyalgia patients but we believe that the technology behind the product can be used to create other products that would be tested separately in different conditions these include distinct prescription products for ptsd and possibly some other related conditions such as traumatic brain injury tbi chronic traumatic encephalopathy cte and also alcoholism each one of those products would have a completely distinct development path associated with it also each of these products would probably have a different dose that would be selected by a dose ranging study which would help us find the dose that is most effective for each of those conditions in some cases it might be a higher dose and other cases it might be lower than the dose we have selected for fibromyalgia based on our phase iia study in addition when we get to the point where we understand more about these conditions and learn whether our technology results in a treatment effect we may have to make other modifications to the products so we can tailor them precisely to the condition we are treating what are tonix pharmaceutical’s plans for the future we believe that we are the leading company in addressing sleep quality and improving restorative sleep we also believe we are the leading company making the connection between sleep quality and chronic pain so in addition to the challenge of developing drugs for marketing approval in the united states and other countries we also have an ambitious program to unravel the causes and mechanisms of disturbed sleep and to learn how it relates to chronic pain we want to be the leader in unravelling these connections and advancing the science of disturbed sleep and chronic pain we believe that developing effective drugs is an extremely important part of advancing medical science we are primarily a patientfocused company and all the people in the company are motivated by a shared passion to help patients with chronic pain and disturbed sleep we also know that this is not easy problem to solve one of the first things we need to show is that we have an effective treatment by an effective treatment i mean a drug that will be fda approved for fibromyalgia and win substantial use by satisfied patients and by doctors who rely on evidencebased medicine if we have an effective treatment we hope to be able to take that advance and tinker with it improve on it and use it as a springboard to make better medicines in the future one of the challenges of working on the medical conditions that originate in the brain and particularly conditions that are unique to human brains is that we cannot rely exclusively on any particular animal model or group of animal models we don’t know of any animal models that are relevant for all of the complexity of the conditions that we are trying to treat i don’t mean to disparage the potential impact of the large talented and productive group of people who are working on animal models i just mean to express humility at the daunting challenge of unravelling problems that are uniquely human it is important to note that there are intriguing animal models for one or another aspect of fibromyalgia similarly there are animal models for one or another aspect of ptsd however in terms of finding out how the human brain winds up with experiencing the symptoms of chronic pain and disturbed sleep in my opinion there is no substitute to human investigation this is why we are focused on human investigation and why we believe we have the expertise and with our new products the tools to start unravelling these complex problems how do you think the future of sleep disorder treatments will develop we think that the most important advance on the horizon and one that we are part of is to move the area of treating sleep problems beyond insomnia i think that too much emphasis has been put on the prescription insomnia drugs and their ability to increase the time that people are asleep i believe we need to move past insomnia and understand the processes of sleep we need to understand what active processes during sleep process good memories and edit out bad memories we need to understand what processes in sleep restore the ability of the body to reset its pain sensory process i think that with time we should be able to develop more and more specific drugs to help people get a good night’s sleep that has the full restorative function people need and deserve sleep in a healthy person should occupy about  of their life if we can give back to people that  of their life and make it a healthy beneficial experience i think that we can make a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of large populations would you like to make any further comments many people have made a distinction between lifesaving and lifestyle drugs that may be a useful distinction in other conditions but we feel that what we are doing is as important as making lifesaving drugs i started my career trying to develop treatments and vaccines for aids i also spent several years working in oncology i founded a company that was later sold whose drug for colon cancer was approved last year so i have spent most of my career working on lifesaving medicines but i have seen the suffering and disability of fibromyalgia patients i have been able to appreciate that fibromyalgia has stolen their lives from them i believe that what we’re doing at tonix in trying to give fibromyalgia patients and ptsd patients back their lives is arguably just as important as saving a life we are really committed to advancing the area and making better medicines where can readers find more information for more information on tonix pharmaceuticals

believed to improve sleep quality in ptsd before focusing on ptsd tonix developed tnx sl for fibromyalgia including a phase a study that included sleep eegs whereas fibromyalgia is associated with a sleep disturbance confined to nonrem sleep ptsd is associated with impaired nonrem and rem sleep tnx disulfiram  mgselegiline  mg tablets for the treatment of alcohol abuse and addiction is in preclinical development tnx tianeptine tablets for ptsd is in preclinical development tnx is a novel oral formulation of tianeptine currently there is no tianeptinecontaining product approved in the us but tianeptine sodium amorphous has been marketed in europe asia and latin america for the treatment of depression since  tonix has discovered a novel salt and polymorph which may provide improved stability consistency and manufacturability relative to the known forms of tianeptine like cyclobenzaprine tianeptine shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties tianeptine modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the inhibitory neuroplasticity observed during periods of stress and steroid use it is a weak muopioid receptor mor agonist but does not have significant affinity for known neurotransmitter receptors tianeptine has an established safety profile based on its decades of use in many european asian and latin american countries tnx is being developed as a first line monotherapy for ptsd for daytime dosing tnx is a new potential vaccine for smallpox tnx is a synthetic form of horsepox which is an otherwise extinct virus evolutionary analysis of modern vaccines indicates that the vaccine isolated and used by dr edward jenner to vaccinate against smallpox was either horsepox or something quite similar the synthesis of horsepox was a collaboration with professor david evans and dr ryan noyce at the university of alberta in edmonton alberta canada tnx or horsepox is the first poxvirus or poxviridae to be synthesized and provides a platform for developing new vaccines against infectious disease and cancer the company was listed on the nasdaq exchange in  under the

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not
