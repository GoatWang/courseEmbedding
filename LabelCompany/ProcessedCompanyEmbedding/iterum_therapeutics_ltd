multidrug resistant infections dublin  chicago il  oral and iv formulation broadspectrum antibiotic for use in hospital and community settings granted qualified infectious disease product qidp designation by us fda  initiation of phase  studies expected by yearend  iterum therapeutics limited an irish clinicalstage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of antiinfectives for patients with infectious diseases and other acute illnesses today announced that its first product candidate sulopenem a novel oral penem antibiotic is under development for the treatment of multidrug resistant infections sulopenem with a safety and efficacy profile similar to other penems has demonstrated broadspectrum coverage and is highly effective against the pathogens most commonly associated with uncomplicated urinary tract infections complicated urinary tract infections and complicated intraabdominal infections uuti cuti and ciai including potent invitro activity against enterobacteriaceae esbl mutants of e coli and k pneumonia the emergence and spread of drugresistant and serious infections is increasing and new antibiotics are needed we believe sulopenem can effectively address the need for new therapies given the existing and projected resistance to generic antibiotic options particularly fluoroquinolones which are the most often used antibiotic class for urinary tract infections said corey fishman iterums ceo with both oral and iv options sulopenem enhances the utility of penems the gold standard treatment of gramnegative infections in the hospital setting oral sulopenem will provide flexibility allowing for simplified effective stepdown therapy upon patient discharge and potentially reducing the length of hospitalization in the case of communityrelated infections sulopenem will provide an efficacious treatment alternative as well as the potential avoidance of hospitalization sulopenem was licensed from pfizer in late  and under the license agreement pfizer received an initial equity interest and an upfront cash payment from iterum pfizer is also eligible to receive additional equity development and commercial eventdriven cash milestone payments and royalties based upon global net sales of any potential sulopenem products in the initial indications of interest it is estimated that there are more than  million infections annually in the us alone with approximately 0 percent of those occurring in uuti resistance to fluoroquinolones currently a main treatment in uuti has become an issue in many parts of the country and is expected to continue to rise additionally there have been no new treatments approved for uuti in the last  years with very limited products in latestage development for uuti resistance rates to fluoroquinolones above 0 percent in some parts of the country and the strong profile of sulopenem we believe that our new unique oral agent will have a leading share of voice and be very well received in the marketplace said dr michael dunne iterums chief scientific officer sulopenems global development efforts to date confirm its safety and efficacy having been studied in more than  subjects in japan with its iv formulation and a phase a oral study in communityacquired pneumonia cap in the us iterum anticipates commencing three phase  studies under special protocol assessment spa with the united states food and drug administration fda and scientific advice from the european medicines agency ema in the initial indications of uuti cuti and ciai by the end of  and filing a new drug application nda and marketing authorization application maa in the second half of  as previously announced iterum secured a  million series a financing in november  from a syndicate of sophisticated life science investors the round was led by frazier healthcare partners and joined by canaan partners sofinnova ventures and new leaf venture partners these investors also backed two previous companies medpointe healthcare and durata therapeutics that the iterum team led grew and successfully sold the iterum team has made tremendous progress over the last  months since licensing this asset we are very excited to continue development of this novel asset and ultimately bring a new powerful agent to the marketplace that provides an effective option to treat both hospital and
