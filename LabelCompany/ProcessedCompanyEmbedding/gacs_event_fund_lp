materia di internal dealingattorno ai prestiti baciati detti pure prestiti soci  introduction the italian government has recently approved italian law decree no  of  february  the decree the decree provides for inter alia a state guarantee scheme the scheme designed to assist italian banks in securitizing and facilitating the removal of nonperforming loans npls from banks balance sheets the decree published on the official gazette of  february  is entered into force on  february  and it needs to be converted into law within the following sixty days the conversion law may provide amendments to the provisions set out by the decree  approval of the scheme by the european commission in the past few months the scheme has been deeply discussed and negotiated between the european commission and the italian ministry of economy and finance mef in this respect the mef has published the following press releases on  january announcing the forthcoming adoption of the guarantee mechanism and on  january setting out the method to calculate the price of the guarantee on 0 february  the european commission has concluded that the state guarantee scheme chosen by the italian authorities is free of state aid within the meaning of eu state aid rules to the extent that the following conditions are satisfied the risk of the state will be limited since the state guarantee only applies to senior tranches the risk distribution of the tranches and the setup of the securitisation entities will be tested and confirmed by the market before the state assumed any risk the states remuneration for the risk taken will be at market terms  the decree the decree provides for a detailed discipline of the state guarantee gacs in particular articles  to  of the decree set forth the following main aspects of the gacs perimeter beneficiaries and time limits structure of the securitisation including rating tranching servicing and priority of payments and main features of the gacs including fee filing procedure enforcement procedure and establishment of a specific fund for the financial resources allocated to the gacs we summarise below the key legal features of thegacs as provided in the decree  perimeter beneficiaries and time limits article  of the decree provides that the mef is authorised to grant a gacs if certain conditions set out in the decree are satisfied in particular the gacs may be granted if the guaranteed obligations arise from tranches issued in the context of securitisation transactions under italian law 0 if the underlying assets including lease receivables are classified as nonperforming and have been transferred by banks having registered office in italy for a period of  months from the date of entry into force of the decree ie  february  the mef may with prior approval of the european commission extend such period up to a maximum of a further  months  appointment of an expert to monitor the compliance of the gacs pursuant to article  of the decree the mef shall appoint within  months following the approval by the european commission of the scheme an independent and qualified expert who shall monitor the compliance of the issue of the state guarantee with the provisions of the decree and in the relevant ec decision  the securitisation securitisation has been identified by the italian government as the financial structure for the disposal by italian banks of the npls and the removal of such npls from the banks balance sheets particularly it is envisaged that an individually managed private securitisation vehicle a spv shall buy npls from the relevant bank the spv shall issue asset backed securities abs and the relevant proceeds will be used to fund the purchase price of the npls which will then constitute the underlying assets backing the abs  key features of the securitisation article  of the decree sets out the main key features of the securitisation transactions in order to benefit of the gacs the assigned receivables shall be transferred to the spv for a purchase price not higher than their net book value ie gross book value net of depreciations – valore lordo al netto delle rettifiche as resulting from the relevant banks balancesheets the abs shall be issued by the spv in at least two tranches the junior tranche of abs shall be redeemed or repaid only if the other tranches have been redeemed in full the spv may issue one or more tranches of mezzanine notes which are subordinated to the payment of interests of the senior notes but are paid in priority to the repayment of principal of the senior notes the spv may enter into financial hedging agreements with market counterparties in order to reduce interest rate risks and for the purpose of manage the risk of mismatch between the recoveries and the amount due as interests on the abs a credit facility can be provided for an amount sufficient to keep the minimum level of financial flexibility consistent with the creditworthiness of the senior tranche  investment grade credit rating from at least one ecai the mef will issue the gacs only after the senior tranches of the abs have received a rating equal to or higher than investment grade from an external credit assessment institution ecai in case a second rating is required by the applicable legislation the second rating on the senior tranche may be issued by an ecai and the second rating shall be equal to or higher than investment grade alternatively the assessment of the credit worthiness in any case equal to or higher than investment grade may be private and solely addressed to the mef in this case the rating agency shall be proposed by the relevant selling bank and approved by the mef the fee due to the rating agency shall be borne by the selling bank or the spv in their analysis the ecai shall evaluate the cash flows associated with the guaranteed securities the credit quality of the underlying npls the tranching and the operating capacity of the servicer appointed  the npls servicer the entity appointed to service and manage the npls receivables the npls servicer shall be an external and independent servicer different from the selling bank and not belonging to the same banking group this should also allow to avoid the risk that the recovery activity of the npls will be negatively affected by any conflict of interest the decision if any of the noteholders to substitute the npls servicer shall not negatively affect the rating assigned to the senior notes  characteristics of the senior notes and the mezzanine notes article  of the decree specifies that the senior notes and the mezzanine notes if any shall have the following characteristics a floating rate remuneration the repayment of principal before the maturity date is linked to the cash flows deriving from the amount recovered and the collections arising from the portfolio of assigned receivables net of all costs concerning the activity of recovery and collection of the assigned receivables and the payment of interests is made in arrears quarterly semiannually or annually and it depends on the outstanding nominal value of the note at the beginning of the relevant interest period in addition it may be provided that the remuneration of the mezzanine notes may be deferred under certain conditions or may depend on performance targets in the collection or recovery activities in respect of the portfolio of assigned receivables  order of priority of payments article  of the decree specifies that the issuer available funds net of the amounts withheld by the npl servicer for its management activity according to the terms agreed with the spv are used in the payment of the following items according to the following order of priority taxes if any amounts due to services providers payment of the amounts due by way of interest and fees in connection with the activation of the credit facility referred to in paragraph  structure of the securitisation paragraph f above payment of the amounts due in respect of the granting of the gacs on the senior notes payment of the amounts due to counterparties of financial hedging agreements payment of the amounts due by way of interest on the senior notes replenishment of the credit facility if drawn payment of the amounts due by way of interest on the mezzanine notes if issued repayment of the principal of the senior notes until full repayment of such notes repayment of the principal of the mezzanine notes until full repayment of such notes payment of the amounts due as principal and interest or other form of remuneration on junior notes  the gacs  main features of the gacs the gacs shall cover exclusively the senior tranches ie the lowerrisk notes and in particular the payments contractually provided in respect of interests and capital in favour of the senior noteholders the gacs becomes effective only when the relevant selling bank has transferred for consideration at least 0 plus  of the junior notes and in any case an amount of junior notes and if issued mezzanine notes which allows the derecognition of the securitised receivables from the accounts of the bank the gacs is an unconditional irrevocable and first demand guarantee for the benefit of the senior noteholders the main purposes of the gacs should be to increase the credit worthiness of the senior abs hence attracting a wide range of investors increasing the investors appetite for such securities to reduce the funding costs of the spv and ultimately to incentivise banks to workout npls facilitating the sale of nonperforming receivables for the banks and improve their liquidity in addition it has been provided that the italian state the public authorities and the companies controlled directly or indirectly by public authorities cannot purchase the junior or the mezzanine notes  fee of the gacs the cost of the gacs has been one of the key points discussed by the italian government with the ec commission as consideration for the gacs the mef will be entitled to receive an annual fee the cost of the gacs will reflect market practice for similar guarantees in order to ensure the aidfree nature of the scheme in particular the market price of a gacs will be calculated with respect to the prices of credit default swaps for italian issuers having a risk level which corresponds to one of the securities to be granted since there is no market for government guarantees article  of the decree identifies the relevant cds baskets and the formula by which the annual price of a gacs is calculated the guarantee fee to be paid will increase over time in case the senior tranche are not repaid in full within the third or the fifth year following the granting of the gacs  procedure for requesting the gacs the gacs is granted by decree to be issued by the mef upon documented request by the relevant selling bank to be filed with the mef  enforcement of the gacs upon failure by the spv to make the relevant payment in full or in part of the amounts due as principal or interests under the senior notes the gacs may be enforced by the relevant senior noteholder within  months following the maturity of the senior notes in compliance with the mandatory terms set out in article  of the decree in the event that such failure to pay lasts for more than  days from the date for payment the senior noteholders with the agreement and also through the representative of the noteholders shall send to the spv a request for the payment of the amount due and not paid after 0 days and within  months from the date of receipt of such request if the spv has not made any of the relevant payments the senior noteholders with the agreement and also through the representative of the noteholders may request the intervention of the gacs within 0 days from the receipt of such relevant request from the senior noteholders the mef shall pay the relevant amount to the senior noteholders in compliance with the transaction documents without any further interests or costs by making the relevant payment the mef is subrogated to the rights of the senior noteholders subject to the contractual limitations set forth in the securitisation documents that should be the relevant limited recourse and nonpetition provisions and is entitled to recover i the amount paid under the gacs ii the interests  at the legal rate  accrued from the payment date to the redemption date and iii the costs incurred for the recovery also by way of the registration procedure in the register ricorso alla procedura di iscrizione a ruolo  establishment of a specific fund a specific fund has been established within the mef in order to achieve the purposes of the gacs specified in the decree the budget of the fund is equal to euro  million in respect of the year  the fund is further financed with the annual fees of the granted gacs such amounts are paid on special accounting secured for the payment
