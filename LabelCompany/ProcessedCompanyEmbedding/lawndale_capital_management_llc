management expresses concerns over equal energy sale agreement requests more thorough disclosure and scrutiny of equals strategic alternatives process dec    et from lawndale capital management llc mill valley calif dec   prnewswire  lawndale capital management llc and its affiliate funds lawndale own more than  million shares or more than  of the outstanding shares of equal energy ltd nequ equal or the company making lawndale one of equals largest shareholders  lawndale has reviewed the december   press release issued by equal announcing that the company had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by petroflow at a price of share lawndale feels a synergistic buyer should be able to easily grow equals cash flow  this higher cash flow should safely support modest increased borrowings that could fund a sizable stock buyback a higher sustainable dividend on the lower share count and still be able to support substantial production and reserves growth  the resulting distribution combined with the remaining higher yielding equal shares should combine in value to more than petroflows share lawndales analysis notes that the proposed transaction is allcash squeezing out public shareholders from all benefits of equals future growth and value creation from its vast and valuable reserves and growing production streams lawndale also notes that petroflow is a former operating partner of equals oklahoma assets and the companys current management  when such dangerous combinations occur lawndales policy is to request more thorough disclosure and apply greater scrutiny of the alternatives process for any value being transferred from equal energy shareholders to the buying group for which shareholders are not being compensated equals december  press release emphasizes the fairness of the transaction price and no longer discusses the companys bright economic prospects in light of substantial increases in industry propane prices and export capacity and equals own reserves and production outlook andrew shapiro president of lawndale stated proponents of transactions often try to argue the strength or fairness of their bid by highlighting a purported premium they are offering to preoffer trading prices  price premium to historical trading is the weakest and most flawed measure of fairness especially in small companies prebid trading takes place in an inefficient vacuum without any expectation of a definitive transaction or even a sleepy board and management being woken up  thus such trading levels are very poor proxy to base an appropriate premium for transfer of a companys control shapiro added we think better measures for fair takeover and change of control value are tested against net present value of discounted cash flows andor valuation multiples to assets or prospective cash flows courts in appraisal actions take a similar view  lawndales policy is to view any socalled deal protections which impede higher and better offers providing greater value to equal shareholders with great suspicion  this is especially so when there is legacy management continuation or sizable severance payouts noshop clauses and breakup fees are examples of such deal protections that may not serve selling shareholders well and require great scrutiny shapiro said instead of focusing on price premiums we believe equals disclosure to shareholders should have and must in the near future detail the scope and extent of the bidding process along with equals reserves and production forecast provided to petroflow  furthermore equal needs to provide to its shareholders all the strategic alternatives considered and not considered along with rationale for their rejection  finally equal should broadly disseminate how any interested alternative bidders may top the agreed purchase price rather than highlighting the impediments for such a superior bid that would provide greater value about lawndale capital

all directors via annual electionsadditional reform and engagement needed from willbros independent directors may    et from lawndale capital management llc mill valley calif may   prnewswire  lawndale capital management llc and its affiliated activist funds lawndale beneficial owners of nearly  million or  of willbros group inc nyse wg willbros or the company announced today its intent to vote for a shareholder proposal calling for willbros board members to be elected annually instead of its present practice of its board members serving staggered year terms the shareholder proposal will be voted on by willbros shareholders at the companys annual meeting scheduled for the morning of june   in houston on may   lawndale sent a letter to willbros lead independent director s miller williams for distribution to willbros independent directors informing them of lawndales intent to vote  for proposal  often called a declassify or destagger proposal  the letter also called for willbros board to implement additional reforms to its corporate governance practices and structure to address changes made necessary when formerly independent chairman john mcnabb was appointed as the companys ceo lawndales letter a copy of which is set forth below called for the following additional steps regarding fixing willbros broken corporate governance the independent directors need to serve the primary role in willbros director search and nomination process and not ceo mcnabb the board should replace edward dipaolo a longtime friend and former business partner of ceo mcnabb from the willbros nominatinggovernance committee that he presently chairs willbros lead independent director williams should step up to his role and ensure an appropriate nonmanagement dialogue conduit with respect to shareholder concerns on topics that are properly deliberated and decided by independent board members and not ceo mcnabb andrew shapiro president of lawndale stated having directors stand for elections annually makes them more accountable to shareholders and could thereby contribute to improved performance and increased firm value the existence of staggered director terms at willbros entrenches and immunizes ineffective directors from necessary accountability and potential replacement by the companys shareowners shapiro added having a longtime friend and former business partner of your ceo as nominatingcorporate governance committee chairman raises serious conflict and governance concerns and is inappropriate  a truly independent board committee should direct and run the director search and nomination process the full text of lawndales letter follows lawndale capital management llc letterhead andrew shapiro president may   by email and overnight delivery s miller williams lead independent director co corporate secretary willbros group inc  post oak parkway suite  houston texas  dear mr williams lawndale capital management llc through the funds it manages lawndale currently owns  of willbros group inc willbros or the company common stock  the recently filed proxy for willbros upcoming june   annual meeting provided disclosure on the companys corporate governance and compensation polices solicited support for several management sponsored proposals and opposed a shareholdersponsored proposal to destagger willbros board elections  we are writing to explain our concerns over willbros corporate governance and the rationale of lawndales vote at your upcoming june   annual meeting for proposal   eliminating willbros classified board of directors and requiring all directors stand for election annually our attempts to discuss these concerns with you directly have been blocked by new ceo john mcnabb whose outdated approach to corporate governance has further contributed to our decision to make this letter and our concerns public  we ask that you distribute a copy of this letter to all independent members of willbros board and confirm your receipt and said distribution lawndales rationale to vote for approval of proposal  declassify resolution in a company such as willbros where shareholders are not allowed to call special meetings or act by written consent the annual meeting election becomes the only forum where shareholders can hold its directors accountable for their oversight and management or lack thereof of the companys affairs  having directors stand for elections annually makes them more accountable to shareholders and could thereby contribute to improved performance and increased firm value  in addition to lawndales practical experience over more than two decades as an activist investor we are further persuaded by the many academic studies that connect classified boards with lower firm valuation and valuedecreasing decisions and policies  we further note that studies cited by willbros in its proxy with contrary findings have included a population of companies ranging from well managed to poorly managed  but in the instance of willbros we dont have a range  instead we have clear evidence of a mismanaged and malgoverned company that suffers from poor oversight and material weaknesses of internal controls  during your tenure and that of all of your fellow directors excluding new director nominee wedmeyer willbros has a long history of risk management issues that have negatively affected shareholder value  this history includes but is not limited to the following a violation of the foreign corrupt practices act in  and associated settlement agreement that resulted in  million in payments by willbros group a very costly  accounting restatement that encompassed two quarters and millions of dollars of newly discovered losses and an incomprehensible inability to forecast operating prospects sufficient to avoid a prospective loan covenant breach after only a single quarter of the loans existence the need for accountability and change at willbros group is not theoretical its real and apparent  the need for accountability is now not over the course of multiple years  the existence of classified staggered director terms at willbros entrenches and immunizes ineffective directors from necessary accountability and potential replacement by this companys shareowners with over  of willbros stock entrenched board should heed any near  affirmative vote the vote on proposal  is technically approved if willbros receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of shares present  however with a huge  block of stock given away to the companys lender kkr on top of another  held by infrastruxtenaska which is subject to a voting agreement with the company only  of the total outstanding shares of willbros are free to vote either for or against proposal  to declassify willbros director elections  we think a truly independent willbros board should properly view a for vote totaling a majority of the noninsiderlender shares or approximately  of total outstanding as sending a resounding message that the board has a need to reform its corporate governance structures and move to declassify willbros director elections additional reforms needed to fix broken willbros corporate governance  in light of the conversion of former independent chairman mcnabb to become ceo his insistence on maintaining a tight grip on willbros board composition and corporate governance practices indicates reforms in the functioning and composition of the companys board are desperately needed as independent chairman since september  mr mcnabb may have been the appropriate director for shareholders to dialogue with regarding the abovementioned risk management and governance events however as recognized by your appointment as lead independent director it is no longer best practice for willbros board to limit or delegate shareholder dialogue on all matters especially corporate governance and compensation policies exclusively to mr mcnabb in his new role as ceo  hence when requesting a dialogue with you several times it was appalling that i was only allowed discussion with ceo mcnabb  further surprising was his lecture on his complete grasp of corporate governance best practices while we are impressed with the background and experience of new director nominee mr phil wedemeyer we were disappointed by ceo mcnabbs representation that this nominee selection as well as others was sourced and ultimately made by mr mcnabb himself  we arent sure whether mr mcnabb formerly as independent chair handpicked the rest of the directors on willbros board  but the impression created by mr mcnabb of the companys director selection and nominations process to say the least is not best practice  ceo mcnabb is no longer independent  you and the other independent directors need to step up to your appropriate role in the director search and nominations process  while perhaps technically independent in the eyes of stock exchange rules having longtime mcnabb friend and former business partner director edward dipaolo remain nominatingcorporate governance committee chairman a role clearly reserved for independent oversight raises serious additional conflict and governance concerns and is inappropriate  certainly ceo mcnabb should provide input as to what skills and experience he feels would be value added to the board  but most of the rest of the process and the ultimate decision of who is nominated must be in the hands of an independent nominatinggovernance committee headed by a truly independent chair  lawndale has identified highly qualified independent individuals that we feel would be good additions to willbros board  a truly independent board committee should be the group who vets such candidates not ceo mcnabb nor his longtime friend mr dipaolo  we would like to discuss these candidates with you and if given the opportunity to better understand the experience and background needs of the board i am sure we could further improve our suggestions it is readily apparent that the status quo of the willbros board when mr mcnabb was independent chairman remains unchanged despite mr mcnabb now being ceo  this is not acceptable  we have requested and continue to seek dialogue with you and an independent nominatinggovernance committee to discuss and address these corporate governance concerns  it is not the proper province of ceo mcnabb to determine decide or declare the companys response to a request that was directed to independent directors you as independent lead director need to step up to your role and ensure an appropriate nonmanagement dialogue conduit with respect to willbros shareholder concerns on topics that are properly deliberated and decided by independent board members and not ceo mcnabb
