provide legal services on select legal matters throughout the entire state of texas as well as legal and litigation support services nationwidefor more information about the services we offer please visit our legal services page or contact us at  although fees and fee structures for any particular legal matter will depend on a number of factors the following general information summarizes those fees and fee structures flat rate feesin order to provide clients with as much predictability and control over their legal fees as is reasonably possible lapin law offices pc offers flatrate fees for many legal services including business law services incorporation and other transactional business law services criminal defense divorce agreed estate planning real estate law services transactional and certain litigation services as well as for many other routine legal services where the nature and complexity of the legal work to be performed is known or can reasonably be estimated prior to the delivery of those services back to the top hourly rate feeslegal matters that are accepted on an hourly rate fee basis typically contested litigation matters are subject to a minimum fee which is determined on a casebycase basis and a requirement that a refundable retainer against future fees be maintained on deposit with the law firm  as with all legal matters clients are provided with regular periodic billings which contain a detailed description of the legal work which was performed on their legal matter back to the top contingency feesour law firm does not accept cases on a contingency fee basis back to the top “free” initial consultationsoften the “free” initial consultations that many attorneys and law firms offer are really nothing more than an opportunity for a lawyer to persuade a potential client to sign a fee contract and pay a substantial retainer  any “free” legal advice that the client might obtain is provided only after the client signs a fee contract and pays a feeit has been our experience at lapin law offices that many clients who come to see us for an initial consultation are best served by a course of action that does not necessarily require expensive legal services  in such cases a client may need only to consult with an attorney to gain a better or clearer understanding of the relevant legal concepts which apply to the client’s matter as well as the practical economic realities which might affect the client’s casebecause we use initial consultations to provide clients with the knowledge they need to make sound decisions — and not as an opportunity to try to sell clients expensive legal services that they may not need — we are unable to offer “free” consultations  however clients who do consult with us can be confident that their consultation is in fact a consultation and not a lawyer’s sales pitchwe encourage prospective clients to schedule an initial consultation before taking any actions that might affect their legal rights such as speaking with any third party meeting with law enforcement or signing any legal document  during your initial consultation we will briefly review your legal rights and responsibilities summarize available courses of action and discuss legal fees associated with the various alternatives back to the top payment optionswe accept payment by cash check or credit card visa or

results are applicable to other households whose annual incomes fit within the range of earnings for the demographic we rank each city by calculating the percentage of affordable housing preferred by our young family cities are grouped into affordability brackets based on the demographics annual household income and realistic cost of living and then sorted by discretionary income which is the yearly amount remaining from earnings after covered expenses annual household income draws on data from the bureau of labor statistics and the realistic cost of living derives from our formula of seven factors—housing food utilities child care taxes health care and transportation our full methodology is available here analysis of the rankings for all cities in texas for our young family housing affordability varies significantly between  cities in texas with populations of  or more our calculations show that the demographic earns an annual household income from  waco to  austin

for a california lawyer referral family law specialized area of legal practice dealing with rights and duties among husbands wives and children divorce there are two types of divorce absolute and limited an absolute divorce also called a divorce a vinculo matrimonii is a judicial termination of a marriage based on marital misconduct or other statutory cause arising after the marriage ceremony as a result of an absolute divorce both parties status becomes single again several jurisdictions statutes authorize limited divorces or divorce a mensa et thoro the consequences of limited divorces vary from state to state typically a limited divorce is commonly referred to as a separation decree the right to cohabitation is terminated but the marriage is undissolved and the status of the parties is not altered many states have enacted what is called nofault divorce statutes this is a response to outdated common law divorce which required proof in a court of law by the divorcing party that the divorcee had done one of several enumerated things as sufficient grounds for the divorce this entailed proving that the spouse had committed adultery or some other unsavory act nofault divorce eliminates this potentially embarrassing and undesirable requirement by providing for the dissolution of a marriage on a finding that the relationship is no longer viable it is hard to tell whether nofault divorce statutes are the cause or an effect of the rising national divorce rate in america look to various state laws for divorce law information child custody generally statutes authorize the court having jurisdiction of divorce proceedings to determine who shall have custody of children from the marriage the authority to do so is considered part of the original jurisdiction of the court and not as a new authority being conferred upon them under the common statutory provision the parents of a child born within a marriage are joint guardians of that child and the rights of both parents are equaleach parent has an equal right to the custody of the child when they separate like other aspects of family law most law in this field is state rather than federal if you have any

code mpc which serves as a good starting place to gain an understanding of the basic structure of criminal liability in recent years the list of federal crimes has grown all statutes describing criminal behavior can be broken down into its various elements most crimes with the exception of strictliability crimes consist of two elements an act or actus reus and a mental state or mens rea prosecutors have to prove each and every element of the crime to yield a conviction if you have any questions about the information provided above contact attorney search network if you would like to be referred to a criminal lawyer contact attorney search network  learn more about criminal law criminal law branch of law that defines crimes establishes punishments and regulates the investigation and prosecution of people accused of committing crimes criminal law includes both substantive law which is addressed in this article and criminal procedure which regulates the implementation and enforcement of substantive criminal law substantive criminal law defines crime and punishmentfor example what act constitutes murder or what punishment a murderer should receive on the other hand criminal procedure is concerned with the legal rules followed and the steps taken to investigate apprehend charge prosecute convict and sentence to punishment individuals who violate substantive criminal law for example criminal procedure describes how a murder trial must be conducted this article discusses criminal law in the context of the common law system which is found in countries such as england canada and the united states in the common law system judges decide cases by referring to principles set forth in previous judicial decisions common law systems are typically contrasted with civil law systems which are found in most western european countries much of latin america and africa and parts of asia in civil law systems judges decide cases by referring to statutes which are enacted by legislatures and compiled in comprehensive books called codes in legal systems based on common law criminal law is distinguished from what is known as civil law in this context the term civil law refers to the rules regulating private relationships such as marriage contracts and personal injuries in contrast criminal law governs actions and relationships that are deemed to harm society as a whole purpose of criminal law criminal law seeks to protect the public from harm by inflicting punishment upon those who have already done harm and by threatening with punishment those who are tempted to do harm the harm that criminal law aims to prevent varies it may be physical harm death or bodily injury to human beings the loss of or damage to property sexual immorality danger to the government disturbance of the public peace and order or injury to the public health conduct that threatens to cause but has not yet caused a harmful result may be enough to constitute a crime thus criminal law often strives to avoid harm by forbidding conduct that may lead to harmful results one purpose of both civil law and criminal law in the common law system is to respond to harmful acts committed by individuals however each type of law provides different responses a person who is injured by the action of another may bring a civil lawsuit against the person who caused the harm if the victim prevails the civil law generally provides that the person who caused the injury must pay money damages to compensate for the harm suffered a person who acts in a way that is considered harmful to society in general may be prosecuted by the government in a criminal case if the individual is convicted found guilty of the crime he or she will be punished under criminal law by either a fine imprisonment or death in some cases a persons wrongful and harmful act can invoke both criminal and civil law responses theories of criminal punishment various theories have been advanced to justify or explain the goals of criminal punishment including retribution deterrence restraint or incapacitation rehabilitation and restoration sometimes punishment advances more than one of these goals at other times a punishment may promote one goal and conflict with another retribution the theory of retribution holds that punishment is imposed on the blameworthy party in order for society to vent its anger toward and exact vengeance upon the criminal supporters of this theory look upon punishment not as a tool to deter future crime but as a device for ensuring that offenders pay for past misconduct deterrence those who support the deterrence theory believe that if punishment is imposed upon a person who has committed a crime the pain inflicted will dissuade the offender and others from repeating the crime when the theory refers to the specific offender who committed the crime it is known as special deterrence general deterrence describes the effect that punishment has when it serves as a public example or threat that deters people other than the initial offender from committing similar crimes restraint some believe that the goal of punishment is restraint if a criminal is confined executed or otherwise incapacitated such punishment will deny the criminal the ability or opportunity to commit further crimes that harm society rehabilitation another possible goal of criminal punishment is rehabilitation of the offender supporters of rehabilitation seek to prevent crime by providing offenders with the education and treatment necessary to eliminate criminal tendencies as well as the skills to become productive members of society restoration the theory of restoration takes a victimoriented approach to crime that emphasizes restitution compensation for victims rather than focus on the punishment of criminals supporters of this theory advocate restoring the victim and creating constructive roles for victims in the criminal justice process for example relatives of a murder victim may be encouraged to testify about the impact of the death when the murderer is sentenced by the court promoters of this theory believe that such victim involvement in the process helps repair the harm caused by crime and facilitates community reconciliation conflicts among goals the various justifications for criminal punishment are not mutually exclusive a particular punishment may advance several goals at the same time a term of imprisonment for example may serve to incapacitate the offender deter others in society from committing similar acts and at the same time provide an opportunity for rehabilitative treatment for the offender on the other hand the goals of punishment may at times conflict the retributive and deterrence theories call for the infliction of unpleasant experiences upon the criminal including harsh prison treatment but the prison environment may not be conducive to or may even defeat rehabilitation no one theory of punishment addresses all the goals of criminal law a combination of theories and goals plays a part in the thinking of the legislators who establish the ranges of punishment for various crimes the judges and jurors who sentence offenders within these ranges and the parole authorities who have the power to release certain prisoners classification of crimes crimes are classified in many different ways common law crimes versus statutory crimes and crimes that are mala in se evil in themselves versus those that are mala prohibita criminal only because the law says so an important classification is the division of crimes into felonies or misdemeanors this distinction is based on the severity of the crime and is rooted in common law in many jurisdictions in the united states felonies are crimes punishable by death or imprisonment in a state prison or penitentiary and misdemeanors are those punishable by fine or imprisonment in a local jail the term jurisdiction refers to the authority of a political entity such as a state or a county or the territory over which that authority is exercised in other jurisdictions crimes punishable by imprisonment for one year or more are felonies and those punishable by fine or imprisonment for less than one year are misdemeanors since each jurisdiction determines the penalties for offenses it defines a misdemeanor in one jurisdiction may constitute a felony in another some jurisdictions have an additional classification for petty offenses also called infractions which are usually punishable by a small fine  the following are reportable crimes and their ucr definitions are listed below murder nonnegligent manslaughter the willful nonnegligent killing of one human being by another note deaths caused by negligence attempts

and personal injury law torts are civil wrongs recognized by law as grounds for a lawsuit these wrongs result in an injury or harm constituting the basis for a claim by the injured party while some torts are also crimes punishable with imprisonment the primary aim of tort law is to provide relief for the damages incurred and deter others from committing the same harms the injured person may sue for an injunction to prevent the continuation of the tortious conduct or for monetary damages among the types of damages the injured party may recover are loss of earnings capacity pain and suffering and reasonable medical expenses they include both present and future expected losses there are numerous specific torts including trespass assault battery negligence products liability and intentional infliction of emotional distress torts fall into three general categories intentional torts eg intentionally hitting a person negligent torts causing an accident by failing to obey traffic rules and strict liability torts eg liability for making and selling defective products intentional torts are those wrongs which the defendant knew or should have known would occur through their actions or inactions negligent torts occur when the defendants actions were unreasonably unsafe strict liability wrongs do not depend on the degree of carefulness by the defendant but are established when a particular action causes damage tort law is state law created through judges common law and by legislatures statutory law many judges and states utilize the restatement of torts nd as an influential guide the restatement is a publication prepared by the american law institute whose aim is to present an orderly statement of the general law of the united states damages damages in a legal sense is the sum of money the law imposes for a breach of some duty or violation of some right generally there are two types of damages  compensatory and punitive the term damages typically includes both categories but the term actual damages is synonymous with compensatory damages and excludes punitive damages compensatory damages like the name suggests are intended to compensate the injured party for his loss or injury punitive damages are awarded to punish a wrongdoer there are other modifying terms placed in front of the word damages like liquidated damages contractually established damages and nominal damages where the court awards a nominal amount such as one dollar for certain types of injuries statutes provide that successful parties should receive some multiple of their actual damages  eg treble damages there are general principles governing what types of damages are awarded itt is generally recognized for instance that punitive damages are not available for breaches of contract except when it is proven that the breach was wanton willful and deliberate products liability law products liability refers to the liability of any or all parties along the chain of manufacture of any product for damage caused by that product this includes the manufacturer of component parts at the top of the chain an assembling manufacturer the wholesaler and the retail store owner at the bottom of the chain products containing inherent defects that cause harm to a consumer of the product or someone to whom the product was loaned given etc are the subjects of products liability suits while products are generally thought of as tangible personal property products liability has stretched that definition to include intangibles gas naturals pets real estate house and writings navigational charts products liability claims can be based on negligence strict liability or breach of warranty of fitness depending on the jurisdiction within which the claim is based many states have enacted comprehensive products liability statutes these statutory provisions can be very diverse such that the the united states department of commerce has promulgated a model uniform products liability act mupla for voluntary use by the states there is no federal products liability law in any jurisdiction one must prove that the product is defective there are three types of product defects that incur liability in manufacturers and suppliers design defects manufacturing defects and defects in marketing design defects are inherent they exist before the product is manufactured while the item might serve its purpose well it can be unreasonably dangerous to use due to a design flaw on the other hand manufacturing defects occur during the construction or production of the item only a few out of many products of the same type are flawed in this case defects in marketing deal with improper instructions and failures to warn consumers of latent dangers in the product products liability is generally considered a strict liability offense strict liability wrongs do not depend on the degree of carefulness by the defendant translated to products liability terms a defendant is liable when it is shown that the product is defective it is irrelevant whether the manufacturer or supplier exercised great care if there is a defect in the product that causes harm he or she will be liable for it the law of products liability is found mainly in common law state judgemade law and in the uniform commercial code article  of the ucc deals with the sales of goods and it has been adopted by most states in it the most important products liability sections are the implied and express warranties of merchantibility in the sales of goods â§â§  and  products liability is derived mainly from torts law if you have any questions about the information provided above please call   or contact attorney search network call attorney search network for a lawyer
