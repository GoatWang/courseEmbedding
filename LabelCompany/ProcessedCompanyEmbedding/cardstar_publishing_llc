corporations compared to llcs knowledge centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the

that supplants the need to carry all those little loyalty cards around with you dealstar is different this app lets you know about deals in your area it’s not a traditional coupon app where you show your iphone to a merchant to get a discount rather it’s a collection of deal provider services the best known being groupon i think most people are already familiar with groupon but in case you aren’t it’s a program that allows you to buy gift certificates at a discounted rate usually about  off groupon has its own app but if you’re interested in expanding to other similar programs and having them all accessible in one place read on dealstar includes the following deal providers buywithme dealon gilt city groupon and mobile spinach i live in a major metropolitan area with millions of residents so i figured there should be plenty of deals in my area well i allowed the app to use my location and then tried each of the deal providers in turn only groupon actually had any deals in my area mobile spinach had two deals that were each about an hour away the others showed me deals in cities that were at least  hours away by car i tapped on one of the groupon deals instead of letting me buy the certificate directly in the app it took me to groupon’s website not the most efficient considering i’m on my iphone for me it would really make more sense just to get the groupon app since groupon is the only deal provider truly in my area and the dedicated app just works better but for you it will really just depend where you live i personally do not like the kinds of “coupons” that you have to buy ahead of time i’ve bought a few but i feel like these companies must make some portion of their profit from people who buy these and then forget to redeem them in time because yes these “coupons” do expire even though you have paid for them that said i know a lot of people buy and use these “coupons” all the time and i’m sure they save a lot of money this way the bottom line is if you live in a major american city and love this particular sort of coupon you’ll probably find this to be a worthwhile app mentioned apps free dealstar cardstar publishing llc free cardstar cardstar
