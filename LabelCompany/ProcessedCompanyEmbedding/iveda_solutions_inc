stock symbol ivda sentir® cloud video surveillance management platform iveda solutions enters mobile video surveillance market with new product  iveda  enabling cloud video surveillance iveda solutions enters mobile video surveillance market with new product september   for immediate release  new product release  mesa az september   – iveda solutions otcbbivda announced today the release of the streaming video converter svc the svc is a fully integrated device that combines the functionality of a high performance video encoder and cellular broadband router specifically designed for digitizing analog invehicle mobile video systems the svc enables live mobile streaming video over the internet for remote access and storage   “frost  sullivan estimates the global mobile video surveillance market to be  billion in  we are excited about the potential growth and the demand that the svc may generate for us in monthly recurring revenue for our centralized video hosting remote storage and realtime surveillance services” said david ly president and ceo of iveda solutions   the svc was designed to be plug and play quick to install and simple to manage for organizations of all sizes from local tow truck companies to fortune  logistics companies the device is perfect for rapid deployment of live mobile streaming video ideal for invehicle applications such as police cars school buses taxicabs delivery trucks and freight trucks it enables any analog invehicle video surveillance system for iveda solutions’ centralized video hosting remote storage and realtime remote surveillance services   using cellular data network the svc allows instant live access to video onboard a vehicle detect bullying and vandalism in school buses assist officers in the field and prevent truck ambush and general theft iveda solutions’ centralized video management platform allows multiple simultaneous access from any internetenabled device anytime anywhere   with the svc video footage that is traditionally stored inside the vehicle through a local recording device can now be virtualized and stored remotely at a fully faulttolerant data center with no concerns of redundancy reliability and lost or damaged data   administrative time to review incidents of live and archived video is immediate eliminating costly hours spent retrieving and pulling data from multiple vehicles and multiple recording devices there is no need to wait for vehicles to return to the transportation yard   prior to the fullyintegrated svc ronald latko transportation director for the mesa unified school district in arizona tested iveda solutions’ converter system and hosting service on some of the mesa school buses “had this cloud computing system been available seven years ago when i first went with dvrs i would have gone this way” said ronald latko latko manages the district’s more than fivehundred buses the largest school transportation fleet in the state   while fleet management may have the technology to know how fast their vehicles are moving where they are and what they are carrying they still can’t see them the svc fills this gap organizations can now have ondemand visual assessment of any vehicle and its environment without the added burden or expense of infrastructure buildout and backend management companies can now have remote access to vehicles in the field to improve operations and to know what is happening at all times to protect their employees and valuable assets   “with many companies investing in endtoend logistics security solutions to ensure quality and safety for their people process and products we believe that iveda solutions’ svc will be a large contributor to the effort” said ly   although mobile video technology has been around for some time its functionality has been very limited as a fixed local solution that is a reactive tool and requires a lot of time for upkeep without truly achieving its intended purpose such technical and operational limitations are a thing of the past with the svc companies can now remotely manage their fleet of vehicles large or small while the vehicles are in motion using invehicle cameras they already have   “this is the wave of the future for school bus safety and security” added latko   about iveda solutions   iveda solutions a wholly owned subsidiary of iveda corp otcbbivda is the

why it matters enabling cloud video surveillance  iveda  enabling cloud video surveillance why the iveda® cloud is the ‘true’ cloud and why it matters enabling cloud video surveillance how iveda’s sentir® platform provides a ‘true cloud’ experience download white paper background information the purpose of this whitepaper is to educate current and potential partners customers and investors about iveda’s cloud technology what is unique about iveda as the public continues to embrace and adopt cloud computing some traditional nvr network video recorder software companies camera manufacturers and security integrators have rushed to capitalize on the trend positioning their solutions as ’cloud’ but generally do not qualify by the true definition of cloud computing this pervasive practice – known as ‘cloudwashing’ – renaming existing products if it were internet based in any manner this practice makes it difficult for consumers and it professionals alike to make informed purchasing decisions iveda started its grand vision of providing video surveillance services on a mass scale by utilizing offthe shelf software and hardware and building a cloud infrastructure hosted at data centers to test the technology and the monthly recurring revenue model iveda amassed customers through direct sales the customers paid a flat monthly fee for access to cloud video surveillance hosting and realtime remote surveillance services through ongoing research and development efforts iveda has evolved into an enabler of cloud video surveillance services utilizing sentir® its cloud video surveillance and data management platform today iveda offers sentir to worldwide telecommunications companies telcos carriers internet service providers isps data centers cable companies and security integrators these companies in turn bundle the video surveillance service with their other offerings end users are provided with a license to use sentir applications on a per device basis through a monthly subscription iveda benefits by making it easier to rapidly increase adoption of sentir while providing partners with a platform that can enhance their service increase average revenue per user arpu and promote customer loyalty what is cloud computing first it is important to define cloud computing cloud computing is the delivery of ondemand hosted services to end users over the internet an example is an application running on a remote server instead ofon a local computer wherein the user accesses it via the internet similar to accessing your bank account online or accessing your customer database from salesforcecom resources are shared by many users which typically pay for a monthly fee for the service the security industry or more so some of the players who have labeled their companies as “cloud video surveillance providers” have adopted the name ‘cloud’ without fully understanding or adhering to the definition of cloud computing in the last year or so ‘cloud’ has become a buzzword used very loosely – basically any camera accessible via the internet video surveillance as a service vsaas is cloud computing at its best – cloud video surveillance services delivered by a service provider to many users surveillance cameras that can be accessible via the internet is not cloud computing we will not bore you with the history of cloud computing but what’s important to note here is that cloud computing is not new some date it back to the s others say the s according to an article published in computerweeklycom the concept of cloud computing was attributed to two american computer scientists named jcr joseph carl robnett licklider and john mccarthy licklider’s vision was for everyone in the world to be interconnected able to access programs from anywhere mccarthy’s idea was to sell computing similar to how a public utility sold water or electricity he introduced the concept of time sharing in computing since then it has evolved with the internet explosion in the s regardless the basic concept of cloud computing remains the same salesforcecom amazon and the many institutions that first introduced online banking are considered the early pioneers of cloud applications – even before these applications were touted cloud services what’s new as far as our industry is concerned is video surveillance in the cloud also known as video surveillance as a service vsaas only in the last couple of years or so has the security technology industry started talking about video surveillance in the cloud characteristics of cloud computing the national institute of standards and technology nist identified five essential elements of cloud model as follows resource pooling – hardware software networking components and other resources are designed and combined with different physical and virtual resources end users share the pooled resources dynamically assigned to them by the cloud service provider based on their needs typically the end user receives services without knowing the location of the resources this can also be referred to as multitenancy architecture which simply means resources eg hardware software bandwidth are shared by many tenants or users broad network access – applications are available typically over the internet utilizing smartphones tablets or computers rapid elasticity – designed for easy scalability without incurring downtime whenever additional capacity is required proportionate with demand to the end user the capabilities for provisioning appear to be unlimited and can be provisioned at any time measured service – cloud systems typically measure resource usage and are charged by the resource they consume eg storage processing bandwidth number of users ondemand selfservice – typically an end user can sign up for server time and network storage or add to an existing service within hours if not minutes most often accomplished online without human interaction common cloud computing models to further demonstrate what true cloud is nist identified the most common models of cloud computing as software as a service saas platform as a service paas and infrastructure as a service iaas to reiterate all these models are delivered by a service provider to many users sharing the software platform or infrastructure some service providers can be a combination of two or even all three infrastructure as a service iaasprovides servers storage networks and operating systems giving saas and paas providers a physical entity to host their software or platform for delivery to their users iaas subscribers do not manage or control the cloud infrastructure but have control over operating systems storage applications and some networking components iaas providers amazon web services more than  marketshare ibm microsoft rackspace google comcast century link platform as a service paas is more than software delivered from the cloud it may include hardware and other tools to develop or customize applications again the key is shared resources the user only pays for what they need and they do not worry about maintaining the platform paas providers forcecom microsoft azure google app engine cloudfoundry appfog software as a service saas is a software distribution model hosted by a service provider and is typically provided to endusers over the internet through a subscription saas providers salesforcecom dropbox google drive icloud google docs microsoft office live iveda’s sentir video surveillance as a service vsaas is the newest cloud computing model specifically for managing and archiving of video footage captured by surveillance cameras onto the cloud also referred to as hosted or managed video video surveillance refers to monitoring of activities in public areas businesses or commercial buildings via analog or ip based or hd cameras for real time or later review vsaas providers iveda nest dlink iveda’s sentir cloud video surveillance platform long before the security industry touted ‘cloud’ or vsaas and even before we labeled our own services ‘cloud’ iveda has been developing cloudready video surveillance products and services since our founding days in  iveda has been adhering to the true meaning of cloud computing it was difficult to explain the solutions we were offering our customers we were selling surveillance cameras but not dvrs instead we hosted and stored video for our customers at our data centers the sentir platform includes surveillance software cloud management software servers storage and networking protocols sentir is a wellintegrated and highlyoptimized solution for large scale video surveillance hosting solution although we employ the highest industry standards of securing our network and data sentir can be used as private video hosting cloud platform for enterprise customers who do not want to put sensitive surveillance data on our public cloud sentir can also be deployed to data centers for running large scale video hosting service it is an allinone “cloud video platform” addressing high availability high performance and scalability   iveda became a purely saas company licensing our sentir platform to telcos carriers and other service providers enabling them to offer vsaas to their customers we still maintain our infrastructure to service our legacy vsaas customers sentir utilizes distributed storage system since storage is one of the biggest concerns for video surveillance systems sentir comes with a highlyflexible highperformance and highlyscalable storage system online replication the storage system can be configured to replication mode which replicates files on the fly across storage servers achieving high availability of files in the storage system accessing files is load balanced to multiple storage servers this allows users to access files on demand as long as one storage server is available this online replication is   an activeactive model where every server is serving requests at the same time compared to activepassive model where data is backed up to a slave server in the background and only the master server is serving requests the activeactive model is superior because it fully utilizes the computation of all storage servers achieving better performance   scaleout storage the scalability of traditional storage systems has limitations as ones business grows the storage capacity may prove insufficient and require expansion in traditional storage systems performance can be improved by replacing the controller however the storage system needs to be shut down to make the replacement additionally the capability of the controller is limited by the performance of its cpu with scaleout storage performance can be increased by simply adding more storage servers to the system more storage servers in the system yield better performance iveda’s distributed scaleout storage system allows customers to add more capacity without interruption every new storage server contributes its computing power as well as adds capacity to the system in addition users can increase capacity of each storage server by adding physical disks or jbods just a bunch of disks iveda’s scaleout storage provides flexibility to users as an example customers requiring video recording for a longer period of time may need two storage servers for replication and each storage server equipped with multiple disks this configuration maximizes capacity and performance at a reasonable cost customers seeking higher storage performance may need twice as many storage servers to handle requests in parallel because scaleout storage system is flexible customers do not need to decide how many servers they need to accommodate future data storage requirements iveda’s storage system allows online expansion customers can expand storage capacity as needed minimizing capital expenditures   thinprovisioning typically systems administrators add capacity ahead of demand to ensure applications won’t crash  oftentimes the excess storage cannot be used by other applications wasting space with thinprovisioning technology a storage administrator creates logical volume to an application as usual but the storage system allocates physical capacity to the volume only when it is required this means administrators can create a huge storage volume for application without actually installing the physical hard drives during initial system set up  for example a  pb ie tb system may be created but the actual physical storage system may only be  tb when utilization of the physical storage approaches a predefined threshold eg  tb administrator can dynamically add more hard drives to the system without interrupting the applications   server virtualization environment iveda provides video surveillance solutions to meet various customer needs each solution has different infrastructure requirements the sentir rack is designed to fit customized requirements by providing a server virtualization environment sentir can be configured to provide both linux and windows virtual machines the virtual machines sentir provides are highly optimized for iveda’s video surveillance solutions several hardwareassisted virtualization technologies are integrated for acceleration including intel virtualization technology intel vtx intel vtd for cpu acceleration and singleroot io virtualization sriov for network interface acceleration in addition sentir provides wellintegrated virtual machine images that can be used to create surveillanceready virtual machines with this feature scaling the video surveillance system is as easy as a few mouse clicks in the near future surveillanceready virtual machines can even be created automatically according to predefined rules peertopeer pp many ip internet protocol cameras ipcams in the market are ppbased wherein the user registers the ipcam to a global name server with the ip address preassigned by the manufacturer upon registration the user can directly connect to the ipcam for live viewing in other words a ppbased ipcam is a video server by itself and includes management software within the camera that streams video content to users some ppbased ipcams are capable of recording video to userprovided public cloud storage services such as google drive apple icloud or dropbox the ppbased ipcams however expose users to a massive security risk since ipcams need to open an entry port to enable the user to connect when there are many viewers to the live video at the same time the bandwidth usage increases and quality decreases additionally since the ipcam is a small device having limited computing power the quality drops significantly when handling multiple viewers with iveda’s cloudbased video surveillance system an ipcam interacts with cloud servers only and the connection is initiated by the ipcam securing the ipcam’s ip address with high computing power and high network bandwidth of cloud servers the system can easily handle multiple viewers in addition cloud servers are maintained and monitored by iveda’s professional it engineers providing a highly secured environment as video content is streamed to and recorded in cloud servers advanced video analysis such as video enhancement face detection and object recognition can be applied why is peertopeer not true cloud and why does it matter although ‘cloud’ is a metaphor for the internet a camera accessible via the internet does not make it ‘cloud’ the term itself connotes onetoone connection versus the inherent onetomany nature of cloud computing using the internet pp cameras send a live video stream to a computer or smartphone for video access using software installed on the computer or an app downloaded on the smartphone cloudbased ipcams can send unlimited video streams to the cloud for hosting recording and centralized video management live and recorded video are delivered to multiple simultaneous users through a web browser or mobile app the distinction may not be important to residential users and small retail operators who may only require one or two cameras to fulfill their needs howeverfor customers with multiple locations enterprise and government customers the distinction is important pp systems do not provide the flexibility and scalability compared to true cloudbased systems because cloud services are typically provisioned from data centers with redundant power abundance of bandwidth and scalable physical infrastructure increased demand due to growth can easily be accommodated cloudbased systems also provide centralized video management platform for ease of use efficiency and convenience peertopeer diagram in a typical pp video surveillance system there is no service provider housing servers and software to be shared by multiple users – no resource pooling each ip camera is hosted from a local computer or smartphone for live viewing video may be stored on that local computer or stored remotely using free storage from amazon or dropbox true cloud video surveillance as a service vsaas in the true definition of cloud computing it is safe to say that iveda is one of a handful of video surveillance companies that meets the standards of cloud computing there are nvr companies that offer software for cloud video surveillance implementation eg milestone axis avhs and salient but the software itself is not cloud some of our legacy service offerings use both milestone and axis avhs and are being hosted at our data centers and delivered to our customers from our cloud iveda has evolved and now offers our own proprietary cloud platform sentir iveda’s products services and platform pass all the accepted standards of cloud computing with defined characteristics such as commercial accessibility over the web software management from a central location and “onetomany” delivery model the results are no user handling of software upgrades and patches and api availability for integration endusers can receive feature and function upgrades over the cloud a new camera is not always required end users are provided with a license to use sentir applications on a per device basis through a monthly subscription to add another level of uniqueness and differentiation from other industry solutions sentir has an integrated cloud storage management technology with a built in softwaredefined storage technology that is designed with big data in mind iveda’s cloud diagram this diagram depicts iveda’s cloud end users only require cameras power and bandwidth to send video to the iveda cloud and an internetenabled device to access video all the processing live and recorded video delivery and storing video for the end user are all handled in the iveda’s cloud consumergrade vs enterpriseclass cloud video surveillance as far as we know there is only one other major cloud video hosting company that fits the mold of a true cloud video surveillance service provider however this provider’s solution caters to residential and small retail operation its distribution channel includes big box consumer stores and online shopping portals the system acts more like a pp other than its broadcasting technology which multiple users that have the url can access without authentication while it provides simple video surveillance security for the home it will not stand the test of even small businesses with multiple locations even more so large enterprises and government entities iveda allows centralized management of cameras in disparate locations on a single dashboard with one login other similar service offerings require the user to switch views or open multiple browser windows it is important to note that iveda is not a competitor to these consumergrade vsaas providers our customers eg telcos carriers data centers isps are which have the competitive edge since they have loyal subscribers more inclined to buy a new service offering from their trusted service provider iveda’s business model is predicated on achieving quick market penetration by mass distribution through organizations with massive customer base already paying a monthly fee for services iveda’s vsaas offering is a great compliment to the services these companies are providing their customers bundling cloud video hosting to their service packages is a natural progression the iveda difference over ten years of cloud video surveillance experience proven cloud video surveillance technology currently being used by
