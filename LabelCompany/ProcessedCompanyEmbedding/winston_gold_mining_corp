estimated total district production of  ounces of gold from  tons of ore an average grade of  ounceston or  gt gold historic records indicate that the custer mine was a major contributor to the overall district production estimate the custer vein was mined continuously for over  ft  metres on five primary levels very little mining was performed below the  ft level  ft elevation the custer and edna mines were in production sporadically from  to  opportunitythe winston property deposits are classified as steeply dipping syntectonic fissure quartzsulfide vein systems that have the potential to extend to considerable depths very little mining was performed below the  foot level  feet elevation of the custer vein and management believes the vein may extend for at least another  feet  metres below this level giving the potential for new resources measuring  feet laterally  feet vertically and averaging up to  feet in width the historic development of the  and  winze down to the  ft level on the western end of the vein system indicates the presence of highgrade mineralization historically miners would only develop secondary shafts known as winzes to quickly access high grade or from above this was faster and cheaper than developing a long drift from the primary shaft there is no reason why this highgrade zone under the  and winze does not continue six holes of the  program cut significant intercepts in veins on the western side of the edna intrusive this identified eight new vein targets that were never before mined this vein trend is  feet long and remains open to the east west and at depth montana’s small miners permit will allow the company to access test and mine these vein systems quickly it is management’s intention to confirm and extend mineralization at the custer and edna mines and commence test mining at a rate of  tons per day ramping up to  tpd if warranted the structure of the custer and edna vein systems and competent nature of the surrounding wall rocks should allow the company to utilize the very cost effective shrinkage stoping mining method for its operations click here for more information on the winston district gold
