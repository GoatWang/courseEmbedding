by peter page the vision that congress had  years ago when it allowed universities to patent technology developed with federal research funds is reality at a nondescript singlestory office industrial complex in ewing township nj in that unremarkable building universal display corp udc a company that took root in  in the laboratories of the center for photonics and optoelectronic materials poem workers are hurriedly erecting sheetrock� walls to create another  square feet of work space at the companys pilot line and development facility photo by frank wojciechowski greg olsen president of sensors unlimited inc and janice mahon vice president of technology commercialization at universal display corp are two beneficiaries of the technology transfer process udcs handinglove working relationship with poem has unleashed a geyser of innovation and the company needs more room for development the fabrication of commercial prototypes for its growing list of manufacturing and customer partners the relationship with princeton has been pivotal to the growth of this company said janice k mahon udc vice president of technology commercialization they are our reason for being in the seven years since udc researchers began working in the labs at poem the company has accumulated  worldwide patents pending or issued related to organic light emitting device oled technology ms mahon said significantly more than  percent of our patents originate from work done at princeton she added it has been a very fruitful relationship udc works closely with professor steve forrest and his researchers a relationship that he says enhances both the companys commercial prospects and the education of students together udc and poem are achieving breakthroughs in basic technology for building flat panel displays lasers and light generating devices the goal is to dramatically enhance display performance with products less expensive than current technologies photonics is rich in problems and poor in solutions so its not hard to find material for good thesis work when you are working with companies that can see beyond the tip of their nose professor forrest said the benefits are enormous for students who are exposed to industrial researchers they see the problems industry faces and they get immediate feedback on their ideas illustration by ann haverallen the path from great idea to great product on store shelves is long and too arduous for most ideas to survive ms mahon described a sort of intellectual bucket brigade anchored at one end by princeton that substitutes for the research and development departments that are too costly for all but the wealthiest corporations basically princeton is the r and we are the d she said princeton is where basic research is conducted then we take that research and build a prototype the next stagedevelopment of the prototype into a productis conducted under a web of licensing agreements that bind princeton udc and corporations eager for new technology udc according to its web site currently has strategic alliances with ppg industries inc of pittsburgh to develop and commercialize udcs proprietary oled materials a license agreement with motorola inc to explore product development stemming from dozens of us and foreign patents and a development and license agreement with aixtron ag of germany to develop and commercialize manufacturing equipment for oleds based on technology originating from princeton called organic vapor phase deposition the complex relationships linking researchers from universities and corporations provide lessons for students in the long haul that it takes to hammer an idea into a product professor forrest said it is a huge gap from the lab to a product the more experience i get the bigger that gap appears he said ms mahon acknowledges the arduous process of bringing technology to market but at the same time sees the fecundity of princeton research as the assurance that udc will indeed have products whatever the challenges princeton is the engine that fuels the pipeline of future products she said  contents     previous story    next story     top of page  bizapediacom
