approximately usd million iberian minerals tsximl has the potential for price explosion the company iberian minerals has a misleading name in my view because the greatest value i see in the company is in a whollyowned subsidiary called mineworx mineworx technologies owns patentpending goldmining and extraction processes their technology has the potential to lower costs reduce pollution reduce the time for permitting and increase the concentration of metal extracted from ore in a shorter period of time than current extraction technologies their technologies could improve the profitability for tens of thousands of existing mines across north america and the world and allow thousands of currentlyunprofitable mines to be reopened and operated profitably this company has a usd million market cap if it were a sure thing the market cap would be i’m guessing in the hundreds of millions whether their technologies will work or not must be considered entirely speculative until they are proven
