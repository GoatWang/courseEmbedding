allege that advocate health care network an illinois nonprofit corporation and the largest healthcare provider in illinois operating  hospitals and more than  healthcare facilities is improperly claiming an exemption from erisa protections for its defined benefit pension plan the “advocate health care network pension plan” or “pension plan” defendants claim that the advocate health care network pension plan is a “church plan” and thus not subject to erisa regulation plaintiffs allege multiple reasons why the advocate health care network pension plan cannot properly claim an exemption from erisa as a church plan including that advocate health care network is not a church or a convention or association of churches but rather is a nonprofit corporation claiming some affiliation with the united church of christ and the evangelical lutheran church in america and that the advocate health care network pension plan was not established by a church or a convention or association of

vested in their accrued benefits in the pension plan failing to furnish plaintiffs or any member of the proposed class with a summary plan description pension benefit statement summary annual report

navigation appeals court rules advocate health care network is not a church plan exempt from erisa laws march   washington dc  march   a federal appeals court has ruled that a pension plan established by illinoisbased advocate health care network does not qualify as a “church plan” exempt from the employee retirement income security act erisa the federal pension law that requires such plans to be fully funded and provides employees with certain rights related to benefit entitlements according to cohen milstein sellers  toll pllc which represents the plaintiffs in the case the unanimous decision by a panel of the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit affirms the decision by judge edmond chang of the us district court for the northern district of illinois denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss and holds that a plan established by a churchaffiliated organization such as advocate health care network is not exempt from erisa under the law’s church plan exemption  “we are pleased with the seventh circuit court’s decision which upholds the rights of advocate health care pension fund participants to a fully funded pension plan and to other federal  protections designed to insure that the money is there when workers need it for their retirement” said plaintiffs’ colead counsel karen l handorf of cohen milstein “this and the third circuit’s ruling in the st peter’s healthcare case send a clear message to these healthcare systems that they cannot get away with denying employees their rightful retirement benefits by claiming that they are church plans exempt from employee retirement fund laws” writing for the panel judge ilana diamond rovner highlighted that erisa is a remedial statute that should be liberally construed in favor of protecting employee benefit plan participants the court also expressed concern that employees of religiouslyaffiliated hospitals in unregulated pension plans could be “left with severely underfunded and uninsured pension plans” if their employer encountered financial trouble  in a separate concurrence judge michael s kanne emphasized that the court’s interpretation of the erisa church plan exemption “does not compel churchaffiliated organizations to operate in a way that violates their religious beliefs” the march   seventh circuit decision concurs with the recent ruling by the us court of appeals for the third circuit that affirmed a lower court decision that the pension plan established by st peter’s healthcare system headquartered in new jersey did not qualify as a church plan exempt from erisa  the panel also cites the us district court for the northern district of california decision that san franciscobased dignity healths pension plan does not qualify for the church plan exemption  plaintiffs in both cases are represented by cohen milstein and their cocounsel keller rohrback llp advocate health care operates  hospitals and more than  other inpatient and outpatient healthcare facilities

plan in accordance with erisa standards and has harmed plan participants by requiring an improperly long five years of service to become fully vested funding the plan at insufficient levels placing the plan’s assets in a trust that does not meet statutory requirements failing to file reports and other notices related to benefits and funding and other erisa violations because the court has determined that the advocate health care network plan is not an exempt church plan it must now comply with all of erisa’s protections which require among other things that the plan be fully funded

it could also threaten the financial security of a generation of their workers fast heading toward retirementon its face advocate health care network v stapleton and the two other cases it’s consolidated with may seem boring—after all they’re about federal regulations on pension plans for churchaffiliated hospitals but these cases are actually the culmination of a new vicious fight over the rights of employers that are loosely affiliated with religious institutions and how they should have to pay retirement benefits to their employees in accordance with federal law related story what lies ahead for the supreme court in a trump administration the three consolidated cases in question seem likely to turn on something deceptively simple the single word “established” in  congress passed a law called the employee retirement income security act or erisa which among other things created guidelines for definedbenefit retirement plans otherwise known as pensions the two most relevant requirements in these cases have to do with good planning and risk mitigation employers have to put money into their employees’ retirement plans in a responsible way so that they can afford to pay out big sums of money once those employees get old but if a company is in financial trouble when it comes time to pay out the promised benefits there’s a safety net erisa established the pension benefit guaranty corporation or pbgc which is effectively a government insurance agency for underfunded pension plansthese rules do not apply to houses of worship benefit plans “established and maintained” by these groups are exempt the reasons for this are a bit opaque said norman stein a professor at drexel university’s kline school of law but an early draft of the law suggests congress “didn’t want churches to have to open their books to the government” legislators also figured religious groups weren’t the problem “people felt that it’s the church—it’s not going to let its plan fail and screw its employees” he said “some of the writing about the statute has speculated that this was a reason too—churches are moral institutions that are going to stand behind their promise to pay for people’s pensions because that’s what religions do”when erisa first passed it wasn’t clear whether this exception would apply longterm to religious organizations that weren’t houses of worship like jewish day schools or catholic hospitals in 0 congress amended the law to clarify that religiously affiliated groups can also maintain what’s called a “church plan” so long as they satisfy certain requirements for years the irs allowed religiously affiliated groups to offer these “church plans” without much controversy since  according the hospitals’ supreme court petition it has sent over 0 letters granting erisa exemptions to organizations as diverse as the princeton theological seminary and the little sisters of the poor an order of nunsthree years ago employees across the country began filing lawsuits claiming that these organizations shouldn’t be exempt after all current and former employees of three healthcare systems filed suit against their employers dignity health in california and saint peter’s healthcare system in new jersey which are both associated with the roman catholic church and advocate health care network in illinois which is jointly associated with the the evangelical lutheran church in america and the united church of christ this is where everything comes back to “established” because these pension plans weren’t “established” by actual churches the employees argue they shouldn’t be exempt from erisaunder church plans a “pension promise is only as good as the word of the hospital”the conflict matters for a few reasons first both sides arguably stand to lose incredible amounts of money the pension rights center which supports the hospital employees has identified at least three cases of allegedly failed church plans when the owners of st anthony medical center in illinois terminated one of its pension plans in 0 the president and ceo told employees she was “very sorry for this surprising and disappointing news” in  the president and ceo of st mary’s hospital in new jersey wrote a letter to employees stating that “there simply are no funds remaining in the retirement plan’s trust” and something similar happened last month at the nowclosed st james hospital in new jersey—the liability in that case is still murkybecause these plans were not insured by the pbgc they have left or may leave huge numbers of workers with less retirement money than they were promised hospital employees and their allies argue that church plans are a way for large employers to avoid complying with federal regulations—ones that were explicitly put in place to protect workers under church plans a “pension promise is only as good as the word of the hospital” stein said “if the hospital gets into financial trouble and the plan is not wellfunded you’re not going to get paid your benefits”but if these hospitals lose they will also face intense financial consequences—and so will other religiously affiliated organizations across the country two appellate courts the third and seventh circuits recently ruled against them and “it is hard to overstate the burden and havoc these two decisions have created” the hospitals wrote in their petition to the supreme court if the lowercourt rulings are affirmed “this will mean renegotiating contracts with employees whose benefits are covered by collectivebargaining agreements revamping benefit structures redesigning pensionfunding policies and overhauling budget plans”there will also be future consequences under erisa employers are required to pay premiums to the pbgc and fund their pension plans at certain levels when the law was created “there was … a feeling that these kinds of church groups could not afford the cost of an erisa plan” said howard shapiro a lawyer at proskauer rose in new orleans who has defended a number of hospitals that are being sued over their church plans if these organizations are retroactively forced to comply with erisa they could face significant and potentially ruinous financial hardshipsthe irony is that both religious groups and their employees could end up suffering if these hospitals lose at the supreme court the church plans at issue “are still the old style of definedbenefit plans which everyone wishes they still had but don’t have anymore” said colleen medill a law professor at the university of nebraska and counsel at the koley jessen law firm “if the hospitals lose and they pay whatever they have to pay in damages they will probably as a pure financial decision freeze or terminate these plans and move over to a definedcontribution kind of plan”definedcontribution plans typically include options like  k features which have become much more popular in recent years—if you look at graphs of the number of organizations that have switched over to these plans “they kind of look like the nike swoosh” said medill the reason behind this rise is straightforward definedcontribution plans shift the burden of bad economic times from employers to employees a  k plan is great when the stock market is doing well but “when the market goes down maybe you don’t love that k plan so much because you bear the risk of market volatility” medill said “in terms of retirementincome security is it better to have an account that goes up and down every day with the market or is it better to know that when i retire i’ll get  a month for life”in some ways it’s surprising that all these issues are coming out now—erisa has been around for  years and congress clarified the nature of church plans in 0 in part the delay is due the nature of retirement plans people pay in over a long period of time and they might not realize the consequences of being part of an uninsured pension plan until they’re about to hit  and realizing they don’t have the money they need to live“churches didn’t write a letter saying ‘by the way we just decided to screw you’”but the delay also has to do with the way the irs has dealt with religiously affiliated groups stein argued “this went on for as long as it did because there was no regulation no formal rulemaking” he said during the 0s and into the s a large number of religiously affiliated organizations won permission from the irs to convert their pension plans into church plans there were big incentives to do so if they won churchplan status the pbgc would refund a portion of the premiums they had paid in the past which meant anything from a few thousand dollars to millions groups would get a privateletter ruling from the irs a form of guidance that does not set precedents for other taxpayers but until 0 when the agency began facing media scrutiny for what one amicus brief called “churchplan conversions” organizations weren’t required to tell employees about the changes to their benefits plans “by and large employees didn’t even know it was happening—churches didn’t write a letter saying ‘by the way we just decided to screw you’” said steinaround the time a handful of plans began failing a wave of lawsuits began—dozens have been filed since  according to court documents “there’s a whole movement among classaction lawyers where they see the potential to sue a very large plan and collect a lot of money in attorney’s fees and have some benefits for the employees” said medill if the hospital employees win “these employers are going to have to come up with a lot of money to fund these plans to come into compliance with erisa”not all churches and religious organizations dislike erisa—in fact any house of worship or religiously affiliated group can voluntarily choose to be subject to the law “there are reasons to do that—namely to take advantage of federal preemption of state laws” said medill erisa limits the scope of what plaintiffs can win in a lawsuit for example—if they operate in states that are more permissive employers might find erisa’s limited legal liability attractive but that’s not what’s happening in these cases “the real issue here is the funding requirement for the pension plans if the plans were subject to erisa the employers would have to pay a lot more to fund these plans” medill saidit’s hard to know how extensive the consequences of this supreme court decision could be but they may not just be financial—shapiro also sees the potential for religiousfreedom conflicts under their church plans religiously affiliated organizations can choose how they invest their money—pacifists can avoid putting money behind ammunitions companies for example or prolife faiths can steer clear of investments related to abortion because erisa imposes specific investment responsibilities on employers shapiro said compliance “could actually conflict with some religious principles that are very important to these entities”these cases don’t break down along clear lines of good vs evil various sides are trying to protect people who have compelling conflicting needs including employees who want to be able to survive retirement and hospitals with missions to follow their teachings and serve the poor everyone involved likely has some religious stake—many people who spend their lives working for religious hospitals are probably just as faithful as the organizations that employ them there’s only one group that will really walk away victorious as medill put it “this will be good for employment for erisa lawyers” share

trump might fire robert mueller peter beinart president trump is reportedly considering drastic action to end the russia investigation why do donald trump and his advisors keep floating the possibility of firing robert mueller an act that would spark the greatest constitutional crisis since watergate perhaps the greatest in modern american history partly it’s simple rage mueller threatens trump and when trump sees someone as a threat he tries to discredit and destroy them—conventional norms of propriety decency and legality be damned but there’s another more calculated reason trump and his advisors may genuinely believe that firing mueller is a smart move and if you put morality aside and see the question in nakedly political terms they may be right the chances that mueller will uncover something damning seem very high trump has already admitted to firing former fbi director james comey over the russia investigation donald trump jr has already admitted to welcoming the opportunity to get dirt on hillary clinton from people he believed were representatives of the russian government even if mueller doesn’t accuse anyone of a crime he’s likely to paint a brutal picture and that’s just on the question of election collusion and obstruction of justice if mueller uses russia to segue into trump’s business dealings who knows what he might find an allstar

health care church plan litigation summary of the lawsuit this lawsuit filed in the northern district of illinois cv0 alleges that the nonprofit healthcare corporation advocate health care network and subsidiaries “advocate” is violating numerous provisions of the employee retirement income security act “erisa” while improperly claiming that the advocate health care network pension plan the “advocate plan” is exempt from erisa’s protections because it is a “church plan” this lawsuit seeks to compel the advocate plan to comply with erisa and also seeks a declaration that the plan does not qualify for church plan exemption summary of the claims the complaint alleges that the plan is not a “church plan” because erisa only exempts pension plans established and maintained by a “church or a convention or association of churches” and advocate a healthcare corporation does not qualify the complaint further alleges that advocate and plan fiduciaries collectively “defendants” are violating erisa by underfunding the plan failing to establish a trust to hold the assets of the plan  that is insured through the pension benefit guarantee corporation requiring participants to complete five years of vesting service to become fully vested in the plan failing to furnish members of the proposed class with pension benefit statements summary annual reports notifications of failure to meet minimum funding or funding notices and failing to file an annual report with respect to the advocate plan with the secretary of labor in addition the lawsuit alleges that the church plan exemption as claimed by advocate is a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment of the constitution because it is not necessary to further the stated purposes of the exemption harms advocate workers puts advocate competitors at an economic disadvantage relieves advocate of no genuine religious burden and creates more government entanglement with alleged religious beliefs than compliance with erisa creates class action this lawsuit is brought on behalf of all participants or beneficiaries of the advocate health care network pension plan excluded from the class are any highlevel

clause religion and the constitution issues  does the employment retirement income security act of ’s “church plan” exemption apply to a pension plan maintained by an otherwisequalifying churchaffiliated organization regardless of whether a church initially established the plan oral argument  march   court below   united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit this consolidated case provides the supreme court with the opportunity to resolve a conflict over the application of the “church plan” exemption of the employee retirement income security act “erisa” the parties disagree over whether the exemption applies to a pension plan maintained by a churchaffiliated entity but not established by a church petitioners advocate health care network et al “advocate” argue that historical evidence and the statutory text establish that the exemption covers pension plans created by church agencies in addition to plans created by churches themselves advocate contends that a contrary interpretation would invite impermissible government interference with and discrimination between religious denominations maria stapleton and fellow respondents “stapleton” contend that the language and purpose of the “church plan” exemption illustrate that it was not meant to cover a pension plan that was not created by a church stapleton also asserts that exempting the pension plans of churchaffiliated entities from erisa violates the establishment clause and puts thousands of churchagency employees at risk of losing their retirement benefits  questions as framed for the court by the parties  the employee retirement income security act of  “erisa” governs employers that offer pensions and other benefits to their employees “church plans” are exempt from erisa’s coverage  usc §§ 00 0b for over thirty years the three federal agencies that administer and enforce erisa—the internal revenue service the department of labor and the pension benefit guaranty corporation—have interpreted the church plan exemption to include pension plans maintained by otherwise qualifying organizations that are associated with or controlled by a church whether or not a church itself established the planthe question presented is whether erisa’s church plan exemption applies so long as a pension plan is maintained by an otherwise qualifying churchaffiliated organization or whether the exemption applies only if in addition a church initially established the plan facts  this case is a combination of appeals from united states courts of appeals for the seventh ninth and third circuits the facts from each case are substantially similar congress enacted the employee retirement income security act “erisa” in  to protect employee retirement benefits see stapleton v advocate health care network  fd   before erisa there were several highprofile pension plan failures because employers were not required to provide insurance ensure their plans were backed sufficiently or honor their plans in the case of failure see id erisa sought to address these issues by requiring employers to make certain disclosures insure plans through the pension benefit guaranty corporation and adhere to baseline funding requirements see id “church plans” however have always been exempt from erisa see id           petitioner advocate health care network “advocate” operates twelve hospitals and over  other health care centers in illinois see stapleton  fd at  their health care network employs over 0 people and generates about  billion in revenue every year see id advocate was formed in  from the merger of lutheran general health systems and evangelical health systems see id while not owned by a church or religious organization advocate is affiliated contractually with both the metropolitan chicago synod of the evangelical lutheran church in america and the illinois conference of the united church of christ see id in its contracts with these two churches advocate affirms its “ministry in health care and the covenantal relationship” it shares with the churches id at  advocate does not maintain its pension plans in accordance with the requirements of erisa because it believes it falls under erisa’s churchplan exemption see idrespondents maria stapleton judith lukas sharon roberts and antoine fox collectively “stapleton” are current or former employees of advocate who claim benefits under advocate pension plans see stapleton  fd at  stapleton contends that advocate should not qualify for the churchplan exemption to erisa because advocate’s pension plan was not developed by a church see id stapleton filed this suit as a proposed class action on behalf of all the employees and beneficiaries covered by advocate’s pension plans see idthe seventh circuit found for stapleton on march   see brief for petitioners advocate health care network et al at  the court held that advocate was not exempt from erisa under the churchplan exemption and was therefore subject to significant penalties see id in substantially similar cases the third and ninth circuits similarly held that other pension plans maintained by church agencies did not fall within the churchplan exemption because the plans were not created by churches see id petitioners from each of the three cases filed petitions for writs of certiorari in the supreme court and the supreme court subsequently granted the petitions and combined the cases into one see id analysis  statutory text and purposeadvocate contends that the statutory text history and purpose of erisa as amended in 0 demonstrate that erisa provides an exemption for pension plans maintained by a churchaffiliated organization even where the church itself did not establish the plan see brief for petitioners advocate health care network et al at  according to advocate the plain literal language of subsection ci of  usc § 00 “the definitions statute” proves that plans established and maintained by churchaffiliated organizations receive an exemption from erisa see id at – advocate asserts that any other interpretation renders the definitions statute superfluous see id at – moreover advocate argues that prior to erisa’s 0 amendments the same subparagraph explicitly mandated churches to establish pension plans thus advocate argues that differences in the statute’s current language and its original language confirm that church establishment of pension plans is not required for churchaffiliated organizations to receive an exemption see id at advocate also looks beyond the statute’s text to the statutory history and purpose of the 0 erisa amendment to support its claim see brief for petitioners at  advocate notes first that the 0 amendment to erisa was intended to address concerns of religious groups resulting from the irs’s interpretation of erisa’s  exemption to exclude plans established by catholic sisters see id at – advocate claims that one purpose of the 0 amendment was to prevent the irs from deciding whether churchaffiliated organizations carry out religious functions or comprise part of a church see id at – advocate argues that the 0 amendment to erisa was also intended to place churchaffiliated organizations and churches on equal ground see id at – advocate explains that congress was aware that distinguishing between churchaffiliated organizations and churches resulted in discrimination between denominations as decentralized religions were more likely than hierarchical religious groups to depend on churchaffiliated organizations and thus less likely to receive an erisa exemption see id at 0– further advocate focuses on the remarks of senator talmadge a sponsor of the 0 amendment who pointed out that the  requirement for church establishment of pension plans was at odds with the fact that pension boards frequently established pension plans see id advocate maintains that because congress was attempting to expand the church plan exemption it does not make sense that congress would simultaneously make it more difficult for churchaffiliated organizations to obtain an exemption see id at  advocate also notes that several of congress’s subsequent laws assumed that churchaffiliated organizations could establish pension plans on their own see id at 0 advocate asserts that requiring churches to establish pension plans to receive the exemption is therefore at odds with the 0 amendment’s history and purpose see id at stapleton counters that the structure text and history of the churchplan exemption require that pension plans must be established by a church for the exemption to apply see brief for respondents maria stapleton et al at  according to stapleton congress prohibited churchaffiliated organizations from establishing exempt pension plans by deeming the employer of the employees of a churchaffiliated organization to be the church under subsection ciii of the definitions statute because pension plans can be established only by the employer under the statute see id at –0 under stapleton’s analysis because churchaffiliated organizations cannot establish plans under the statute their plans clearly cannot count as exempt church plans see id at 0 stapleton also disputes advocate’s claim that stapleton’s construction renders the words “established and” in the definitions statute superfluous see id at –moreover stapleton disputes advocate’s claim that the purpose of the 0 amendment was to permit churchaffiliated organizations to receive an erisa exemption when a church did not initially establish the plan see brief for respondents at  stapleton argues that congress in fact added subsections ciiii and ciii to enable churches to continue providing pension plans to employees of churchaffiliated organizations see id at  as evidence of this intent stapleton notes that under the original statute churches would have lost the ability to provide benefits to employees of organizations affiliated with their churches in  see id at  stapleton therefore contends that the point of the 0 amendment was not to create a new loophole for churchaffiliated organizations to receive an erisa exemption or to eliminate the requirement that churches establish church plans see id at 0 additionally stapleton argues that subsection ci was not a “gamechanging” provision but rather a subsidiary provision created to address technical concerns about pension boards see id at – further stapleton contends that permitting churchaffiliated organizations to receive erisa exemptions where a church did not initially establish the pension plan is at odds with the aim of the churchplan exemption itself which was to prevent the “examination of books and records” of churches and protect the independence of churches in relation to the state see id at – according to stapleton the entanglement concern is a not an issue with churchaffiliated organizations such as hospitals because unlike churches a review of churchaffiliated organizations would not involve a review of activities confidential to the church see id stapleton also disputes advocate’s assertion that congress’s subsequent laws eliminate the requirement that churches must establish church plans see id at –agency deferencewhile advocate asserts that the statutory language is unambiguous it argues in the alternative that if the text is ambiguous the internal revenue service irs pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc and the department of labor dol should receive deference under skidmore v swift  co which provides deference to agency interpretations based on their “power to persuade” see brief for petitioners at  according to advocate skidmore deference should apply because three different agencies each came to the same interpretation of a complex statute and applied the same interpretation hundreds of times for over thirty years throughout both republican and democratic administrations see id at  advocate argues that the irs’s interpretation as set forth in its  general counsel memorandum should be found persuasive because it is reasoned and detailed see id moreover advocate notes that the irs provided its interpretation in its memorandum shortly after the 0 amendment which makes it more deserving of deference see id at  lastly advocate maintains that the reliance interests on the agencies’ interpretations of the 0 amendment are so great that the interpretations should be given deference see id at  stapleton however contends that the agencies’ interpretation of the statute is not entitled to skidmore deference because the agencies have not thoroughly considered the interpretation of the portions of the statute at issue in this case see brief for respondents at  stapleton notes that the irs general counsel memorandum did not consider numerous factors including the potential harmful effects its decision could have on employees see id at – stapleton also questions the legitimacy of the reliance interests cited by advocate noting for instance that the irs memorandum specifically states that the document should not be relied upon or used as precedent see id at  in addition stapleton argues that if the churchaffiliated organizations had to immediately comply with erisa they would not suffer serious consequences because essentially all businesses—including the competitors of the churchaffiliated organizations—already must comply with erisa see id at – stapleton argues further that if forced to comply with erisa churchaffiliated organizations would be unlikely to face large financial penalties see idconstitutional avoidanceadvocate asserts that to avoid rendering the statute constitutionally suspect erisa must be interpreted to permit churchaffiliated organizations to establish church plans see brief for petitioners at  advocate contends that if only churches could establish church plans the statute would run afoul of the first amendment requiring the government to become too entangled with religion by determining whether an organization constitutes a church see id at – in addition advocate argues that stapleton’s interpretation discriminates against decentralized religions see id at  according to advocate such discrimination is impermissible under the establishment clause see id moreover advocate notes that the court has continued to uphold statutes providing exemptions to religious organizations from either tax or regulatory burdens as exemptions are different from subsidies see id at 0– advocate argues that an exemption in this case would not result in impermissible thirdparty harms see id at on the other hand stapleton contends that the canon of constitutional avoidance requires its own reading—that erisa’s churchplan exemption applies only when churches establish church plans—as advocate’s reading casts serious doubts on the constitutionality of the statute see brief for respondents at  while stapleton concedes that the government can take steps to evade excessive entanglement with religion and can lessen governmentcreated burdens on religion stapleton argues that neither is the case here see id at – stapleton therefore maintains that the government’s exemption of churchaffiliated organizations from erisa a generally applicable law is unconstitutional under the establishment clause see id at  according to stapleton excessive government entanglement with religion would not result under its interpretation because an examination of churchaffiliated organizations does not affect the confidentiality of the organization’s activities in the way that a review of a church itself does see id at – stapleton also claims that both the federal and state governments often make distinctions between churches and churchaffiliated organizations see id at 0 moreover stapleton disputes advocate’s claim that denominational discrimination would occur under its interpretation noting that advocate failed to name a single church or churchaffiliated organization that would be discriminated against see id at  additionally stapleton claims that advocate’s reading would have significant thirdparty harms including the employees of churchaffiliated organizations losing erisa protections which makes advocate’s reading impermissible under the establishment clause see id at – discussion  reliance and compliance coststhe illinois conference of the united church of christ and fellow amici “illinois conference” argue that churchagency pension plans should be exempt from erisa regardless of whether they were established by a church because these organizations have relied on almost thirtyfive years of rulings affirming such an exemption see brief of amici curiae illinois conference of the united church of christ et al “illinois conference” in support of petitioners at  according to the illinois conference since erisa’s inception the irs and dol have consistently issued private letter rulings and opinions holding that the churchplan exemption applies to churchagency pension plans see id the illinois conference asserts that requiring compliance with erisa at this stage would be unfair to the numerous organizations that have arranged their pension plans based on this guidance see id a group of catholic health and social services organizations in support of advocate further contend that requiring churchagencies to comply with erisa would interfere with their charitable and religious missions see brief of amici curiae church defendant in support of petitioners at  alliance defending freedom and thomas more society “alliance defending freedom” argue that the penalties for noncompliance and the future costs of compliance would cripple churchagencies which would in turn deprive countless american communities of the critical services that these organizations provide see brief of amici curiae alliance defending freedom and thomas more society “alliance defending freedom” in support of petitioners at –in response americans united for separation of church and state and fellow amici “americans united” contend that requiring compliance with erisa would not unduly burden churchagencies but would instead level the playing field  see brief of amici curiae americans united for separation of church and state et al “americans united” in support of respondents at  americans united argues that churchaffiliated hospitals and charities are unfairly advantaged by their current exemptions from erisa and that requiring compliance would simply mean they must fulfill the same obligations as secular organizations see id furthermore pension rights center contends that the current expansive interpretation of the “church plan” exemption presents significant risks to the thousands of employees who work for churchaffiliated groups see brief of amicus curiae pension rights center in support of respondents at 0 erisaexempt organizations do not have to insure or stand by their pension plans which americans united contends puts their employees at risk of losing access to the retirement benefits they have been promised see brief of americans united at   aarp and the aarp foundation collectively “aarp” point out that several churchagency pension plans have failed over the past decade and had devastating financial effects on employees see brief of amici curiae aarp and aarp foundation in support of respondents at –discrimination and entanglement with religionalliance defending freedom argues that pension plans created by churchaffiliated organizations should be exempt from erisa because demanding compliance would lead to impermissible government discrimination between religious denominations see brief of alliance defending freedom at 0 further according to church alliance holding that the “church plan” exemption only applies to plans created by churches would favor hierarchical denominations where the central church is more likely to establish a pension plan over decentralized denominations see brief of amicus curiae church alliance in support of petitioners at  the general conference of seventhday adventists “seventhday adventists” also argues that advocate’s reading of the “church plan” exemption would favor denominations that place health care at the center of their religious mission see brief of amicus curiae the general conference of seventhday adventists “seventhday adventists” in support of petitioners at  further the catholic health association of the united states “catholic health association” points out that expecting the central church such as the vatican to establish a pension plan misunderstands the decentralized and individualized nature of many religious denominations see brief of amicus curiae the catholic health association of the united states in support of petitioners at  the seventhday adventists also assert that requiring churchagencies to comply with erisa would lead to excessive government entanglement with religious doctrine see brief of seventhday adventists at  the catholic health association adds that limiting the “church plan” exemption would lead to the government impermissibly questioning whether entities are “religious enough” to be considered churches see brief of catholic health association at  alliance defending freedom argues that this interference could eventually lead religious entities to alter their operations to conform to the government’s interpretation of religiosity see brief of alliance defending freedom at americans united asserts that advocate’s concerns about discrimination against decentralized organizations overlook the fact that congress specifically amended erisa to permit the less burdensome plan administration schemes that tend to be more popular with decentralized denominations see brief of americans united at – americans united notes for instance that erisa currently allows associations of churches and pension boards to maintain church plans see id the national employment lawyers association “nela” also claims that advocate’s apprehensions about government entanglement with religion are overstated see brief of amicus curiae national employment lawyers association “nela” in support of respondents at – aarp and nela argue that the purpose of the churchplan exemption was to prevent the government from searching through confidential church books and records and that no such confidential records are involved when churchagencies—which are businesses not churches—create their own pension plans see brief of aarp at  see also brief of nela at – americans united and nela also contend that the petitioners’ concern about forcing churches to disclose confidential information to the government ignores the fact that these organizations must already disclose significant amounts of information to comply with federal programs like medicaid see brief of americans united at  see also brief of nela at  furthermore americans united argues that the government is quite capable of deciding whether an entity qualifies as a church because there are already
