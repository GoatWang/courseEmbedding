in santa ana college foundation a history of success a future of promise sac home donate now mark lowry page contenthalls of fame   truly i say to you as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers and sisters you did it to me  matthew  esv   mark a lowry  it was the parable of the talents matthew  that guided mark lowry into his lifes work my best friend tim miller and i always talked about fighting crime and injustice mark says we planned to go into law enforcement together which is why i took my first class introduction to law enforcement under prof george wright while i was still a senior in high school   i loved prof wrights class he was captivating dynamic and animated he made law enforcement vivid   i also had an internship at the santa ana police department and i loved the officers the ridealongs and the excitement of the code  chases but i also saw how the stress affected the officers in a variety of ways as tim went through the police academy he began to change in ways that were unexpected and i came to believe that a career in law enforcement was not the way i wanted to serve tim continued his career in law enforcement and i went into social services instead of criminal justice im in social justice   his next class introduction to philosophy was another pivotal course in his journey toward a career dedicated to social justice  prof vasquez class was very provocative and stimulating  it was also one of the core classes that helped create a solid foundation for me to pursue a bachelor of arts degree in social ecology from the university of california irvine social ecology includes public planning and policy environmental studies human behavior and social behavior  it involves a lot of abstract and critical thinking in order to understand social issues you have to understand how they interrelate to inform the total issue and to then craft creative solutions   after receiving degrees in administration of justice from sac  and a bachelor of arts degree in social ecology from uci  mark was employed by lutheran social services as marketing director for a startup program censorview and then as an occupancy specialist for the orange county housing authority in  he found his niche in the community action partnership of orange county first as a research analyst then as manager of a homeless services program in  he became manager of the orange county food bank a position that was upgraded to director as the operation grew    in this capacity mark not only helps feed the hungry he also maintains close ties to community resources including santa ana college  in addition to its academic courses sac has a long tradition of community service dozens of sac students have worked at the food bank coming both in groups and individually often through the colleges service learning department   for example three young girls taking a math class at sac came to the food bank to volunteer we administer a federal nutrition program that serves seniors and volunteers package the six different food boxes that we distribute each based on specific nutritional needs a total of  food boxes are distributed every month to seniors  we wanted to find out the financial impact of that program on the community   the students did price surveys based on six distinct menus at three different types of retail outlets a minimart convenience store which is typically the most expensive an average grocery store such as ralphsstater brosvons and then big box stores such as costco and foodless   they came up with a mean price for each product and a mean price for each of the six different food boxes which revealed that those boxes represent more than  million in food distributed just to seniors  boxesmonth x  months x  per box this data gave me the ability to describe our service in terms of financial impact on the community   because the college has this tradition of community service mark says that he tries to personally staff tables at events on campus that promote volunteer opportunities   in reflection mark says there are a host of complicated social and economic issues such as the cost of housing the kinds and availability of jobs the range of wages and salaries that make the food bank necessary hunger in a community like ours is simply a symptom of deeper underlying issues classes i took at sac and at uci gave me the foundation to understand the complexities of issues that contribute to social problems and identify potential solutions   mark is a frequent speaker in a variety of venues and is an oftenquoted source for media outlets on the economy hunger food and nutrition he organizes highprofile annual events such as national family volunteer day which raised  and attracted  volunteers who assembled  food boxes during the  event   most recently mark worked with the board of directors of the great park in irvine to advocate for an agricultural element as a result designers agreed to dedicate  acres for agricultural use and donate a portion of each crop to the food bank on an ongoing basis the arrangement has already produced nearly  tons of locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables that have been distributed to vulnerable orange county residents   when asked his marital status mark would check the single box but it is clear that he is married to pursuing innumerable issues and opportunities related to social and economic justice that will feed the hungry clothe the naked and comfort those in need matthew      rightcolumncontent  privacy policy
