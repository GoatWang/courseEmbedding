york ny  business wire  april    the rush of money into index equity funds has ballooned into a market mania that is fueling excessive ceo compensation and putting the savings of ordinary investors at risk according to a new report by wintergreen advisers that was released today the report noted that the massive assets of index giants vanguard blackrock nyse blk and state street nyse stt make them the largest block of shareholders in americas largest publicly traded companies holding an average of  of the shares outstanding of the top  companies in the sp  david winters ceo of wintergreen advisers said trillions of ordinary investors dollars are now committed to a mechanistic strategy that day in and day out simply buys stocks without a thought for their actual underlying value students of market history know that index mania  like other market fads before it  will end badly the sad reality is that index funds have turned ordinary investors into the pawns in a game that undermines the integrity of american markets and imposes costs on society that dont show up in index fund expense ratios we believe that one consequence of this is that billions of dollars of value created by american companies are being diverted to a select few executives while ordinary investors distracted by low fee hype are subjected to dangerous risk concentrations in their retirement portfolios wintergreens analysis of the voting histories of the leading sp  index funds run by vanguard blackrock and state street over the past five years for the  largest companies in the sp  found that these funds cast their votes in favor of equity compensation plans  of the time and opposed executives pay packages less than  of the time they withheld or cast votes against directors a meager  of the time liz cohernour coo of wintergreen advisers added index mania has been a boon for executives of companies in the index whether or not these executives are delivering real shareholder value flows into big indexs fund products that tend to vote with management means a significant block of the shareholders in an sp  company can generally be counted on to support executive compensation packages even when shareholders are receiving meager returns the wintergreen report noted that index hype creates an illusion of safety and diversification wintergreen believes this can lead ordinary investors to take on a dangerously high concentration of risk in their investment portfolios by wintergreens estimate the top  securities by market value in the sp  in  contributed over  of the indexs total return while the top  securities by performance contributed  of the indexs total return apple microsoft facebook and intel alone accounted for over  of the total return of the sp  in  click here

co cto nyse cto and its directors collectively the defendants entered into a settlement agreement whereby cto shareholders will be permitted to vote on wintergreens nominees to ctos board of directors at ctos  annual meeting this is exactly the relief wintergreen requested in its complaint against the defendants and wintergreen views the settlement as a complete victory both for itself and for all cto shareholders wintergreen serves as investment adviser to clients who have collectively owned more than  of ctos shares since  and who currently own more than  of ctos shares in november of  wintergreen notified cto of its nomination of four individuals to serve on ctos board and to be voted on by shareholders rather than engage wintergreen on the merits cto sought to reject wintergreens right to nominate directors effectively taking away the ability of cto shareholders to choose their own directors although wintergreen attempted in good faith to negotiate with cto ultimately wintergreen was forced to defend its shareholder rights in court wintergreens chief operating officer liz cohernour issued the following statement on behalf of wintergreen we are extremely pleased to have vindicated our rights as shareholders of cto and are looking forward to presenting our vision for the future of cto directly to shareholders and providing them with a real choice at the  annual meeting we believe that our nominees have the expertise and experience to unlock significant unrealized shareholder value in the company while also implementing sound corporate governance and compensation policies that will benefit shareholders not senior management it is a shame the current board has sought to limit the right of ctos shareholders to choose their board representatives arguably a shareholders most important right in order to stay in power this is not an isolated incident and represents yet another example of existing management putting their own interests before those of shareholders in addition to making our case forcefully to fellow cto shareholders we look forward to holding cto and its directors accountable  about wintergreen advisers established in  by

advisers llc wintergreen or the firm has brought an action the action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against consolidatedtomoka land co cto or the company nyse cto and the current members of the companys board of directors the board in the circuit court of the seventh judicial circuit in and for volusia county florida in order to vindicate its right as a shareholder of the company to present a proposal to shareholders for the election of four individuals to the board at the companys upcoming annual shareholder meeting in november  wintergreen submitted to the company a proposal to nominate four individuals to the board at the upcoming annual shareholder meeting the proposal wintergreen proposed these director nominees to represent the interests of all shareholders of cto motivated solely by a desire to stifle legitimate shareholder action that would diminish their control over the company and despite in the past ten years never questioning wintergreens right to bring nearlyidentical proposals cto and the board improperly rejected the proposal in violation of state and federal law wintergreen believes that this decision to exclude the proposal stands on hollow grounds and is yet another example of the lengths to which members of management and the board entrenched in their lucrative positions are willing to go to deny shareholders the right to choose their representatives on the board and to continue operating in an opaque and deceitful manner at great expense to the owners of the company its shareholders this result left wintergreen with little other choice than to defend its rights as a cto shareholder and bring this action against cto continuing wintergreens efforts to take action to find ways to maximize value for all shareholders improve corporate governance and otherwise ensure that the interests of all shareholders remain protected wintergreen believes that its shareholder proposals over the past ten years have improved corporate governance at cto and have included the implementation of annual elections of directors the separation of the roles of ceo and chairman of the board and annual say on pay votes which have benefitted all cto shareholders wintergreen has endeavored to serve the interests of all shareholders and this improved corporate governance has also improved ctos stature as a company as evidenced by recent investor sentiment and by the vote at last years annual meeting when over  of the votes cast directed cto to hire an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value through the sale of cto and over  of the votes were cast against ctos proposal to issue additional shares of common stock which would dilute existing shareholders by more than  if fully exercised shareholders have expressed their extreme dissatisfaction with the companys prolonged value drift in the action wintergreen alleges claims for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief i against cto and the current members of the board collectively the defendants for breach of contract ii against the members of the board for breach of fiduciary duty iii against all defendants for declaratory judgment pursuant to florida statutes §  and iv against cto for violating federal proxy requirements under section a of the securities exchange act and rule a  cfr § a promulgated thereunder due to the impending dates of ctos annual meeting and the date set as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting wintergreen moved for a temporary injunction prohibiting defendants from filing ctos proxy statement and holding the annual meeting or in the alternative prohibiting defendants from including a proposal for the election of directors in ctos proxy statement and from bringing the election of directors before a vote at the annual meeting until this litigation is resolved wintergreen also moved for a speedy hearing and to shorten the time for defendants to respond to discovery requests wintergreen believes cto is wrong on the law and the facts the action motion for temporary injunction and motion for speedy hearing will be publicly available at

arrest prolonged value drift january   mountain lakes nj  wintergreen advisers llc serves as investment adviser to clients who have collectively owned more than  of consolidatedtomoka land co s cto nyse cto shares since  and who currently own more than  of ctos shares attempting to block our legitimate right to propose nominees to ctos board of directors is yet another example of ctos board and management putting their own interests before those of shareholders and seeking to distract shareholders from their own mismanagement as evidenced by recent investor sentiment and by the vote at last years annual meeting of over  of the votes cast directing cto to hire an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value through the sale of cto shareholders are extremely unhappy with the companys prolonged value drift we believe cto shareholders would welcome directors with shared values to arrest this drift and we think ctos current directors and management believe this as well which is why they are trying desperately to keep wintergreens nominees off the ballot if our goal was to exit this investment at any cost we would take cto up on its repeated offers to buy back all or a large portion of our shares which according to them we apparently do not own however we believe in the value of cto and its underlying properties and wish to maximize this value to the

quickly we believe an independent third party would accelerate this process by assisting ctos board of directors the board in identifying viable opportunities to maximize shareholder value we plan to vote against certain other proxy items including the boards item  proposal to issue additional shares of common stock  according to our analysis of the proxy statement we believe this issuance if fully exercised could dilute existing cto shareholders to the tune of more than  accordingly we believe that this proposal is destructive to the interests of cto shareholders and we plan on voting no to item  as described more fully below to help illustrate what this dilution means for a shareholder of cto if this proposal passes and the company issues the full amount of the requested shares a shareholder who owns  worth of stock would be diluted such that the value of the shares immediately after the additional stock is issued would be  we plan to vote against the following board sponsored proposals  against the issuance of additional shares of cto  against the reelection of each director  against the ratification of the appointment of grant thornton llp as auditor  against the advisory vote to approve executive compensation as outlined in detail below we believe these items are not in the best interest of cto shareholders and that shareholders deserve better than this item  we intend to vote against the reelection of all  directors we believe that the board has failed to look out for the best interests of cto shareholders the boards latest transgression is a proxy statement that includes a proposal to issue more than  million shares which could by our calculations result in dilution of over  for existing shareholders we do not believe there is a beneficial reason to shareholders for this issuance and think that better financing options are clearly available additionally we view the proposal to increase compensation for what we believe to be a failed management team is egregious and another indication that the board needs to be replaced further we have reached out to the board on multiple occasions in an attempt to work with the board on the issues that we have identified but we have not received a satisfactory response in our view the board has expressed an interest to rubber stamp managements actions and is no longer focused on its true role  to look after the interests of cto shareholders item  we intend to vote against the ratification of the appointment of grant thornton as auditor in a series of letters to the board  we have identified what we believe to be deficiencies in ctos publicly filed reports we also find it alarming that over a twoyear period grant thorntons audit fees have doubled without a clear explanation to cto shareholders as to why this has occurred we believe that the engagement of a new audit firm that can undertake a thorough review of ctos financial statements and disclosures would benefit all shareholders item  we intend to vote against the approval of executive compensation we think increasing john albrights total compensation including stock and option awards by over five times his  compensation is reckless destructive and undeserved we believe ctos recent share price performance has been abysmal its  performance in  fell well behind both the overall sp s return of  and the reit indexs return of   with the rebound in local real estate prices and the low interest rate environment we believe managements actions have detracted from share performance and absolutely no increase in compensation is warranted we also find it very curious that cto has shifted the membership of its peer group twice in the last three years and also uses a different listing of peers in ctos investor presentations than what is contained in ctos annual report we think this constant shifting and misdirection has become all too commonplace for this management team and shareholders should not reward this type of behavior additionally in our view mr albright has demonstrated a pattern of taking on dangerous amounts of leverage both with regards to cto and his personal dealings as detailed in the  proxy mr albright beneficially owns   shares of cto however footnote  in much smaller print reveals that mr albright has pledged most of these shares in a margin trading account and as security for a line of credit we think leveraging his cto shares is risky and if ctos market value declines mr albright could be subject to a margin call that may force him to liquidate his cto shares under mr albrights leadership cto has also taken on what we believe to be a dangerous amount of leverage which could lead to disastrous results for cto shareholders as recently as  the company wrote of the risks of leverage writing to shareholders that the real estate market has always been cyclical in down markets significant debt can severely weaken a real estate company by forcing it to sell off valuable assets at a discount  given ctos recent use of leverage it seems to us that the lessons of the past have been forgotten wintergreen will not support a plan to increase the compensation of mr albright by more than five times his prior years pay nothing we have seen from mr albright justifies this increase item  we will vote for the hiring of an independent advisor to evaluate ways to maximize shareholder value we are pleased that deutsche bank was hired to pursue the directive of our proxy proposal to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value including the possible liquidation of assets or the sale of the company this is a good first step at this point we cannot tell precisely what instructions have been given to deutsche bank as investment banker advisor nor can we know how vigorously it will be permitted by the board to explore all meaningful strategic paths for maximizing shareholder value that said we believe cto is trading at a massive discount to the value of its underlying assets and that if deutsche bank acts in accordance with our proposal we think it will uncover numerous opportunities to unlock shareholder value we question the companys motives for not supporting the wintergreen proposal we do not believe that the continued pursuit of the companys business plan is a viable option we think it is time to initiate expedite and ultimately finalize a sales process while interest rates remain low in order to take advantage of the ongoing real estate market recovery we have heard from many other cto shareholders who support our proposal we believe prior and current cto management alike has failed to enhance shareholder value beyond a slight reflection of the recovery of the real estate market and a potential sale could be the best way to unlock ctos value item  we will vote against the issuance of additional shares we believe there is absolutely no need to dilute shareholders by issuing common stock  there are several tax efficient transactions that the company could pursue without diluting shareholders the companys current obligation to bond holders is significant approximately  million to meet its payment obligations without issuing additional shares and diluting shareholders potentially by over  the company has available to it  the raleigh north carolina office complex purchased in november  for m   the commercial loan portfolio of approximately m   the land pipeline sales of approximately m  that will be closing in the coming years  the approximately  million in treasury stock subject to ctos share price we believe the company could liquidate or in the case of the treasury stock sell these assets to raise much needed cash we believe the company should use any excess proceeds to repay debt and begin the process of deleveraging the company the proceeds of the sale of the investment portfolio which was recently liquidated at a substantial loss  should also be used to reduce debt in preparation for the upcoming need for cash between now and the bonds  conversion date we believe there is ample opportunity for the board to responsibly meet bond holder obligations while also addressing shareholder concerns wintergreen believes that potentially diluting shareholders to the tune of  if the additional shares are fully issued is not the preferred method for cto to meet its obligations to bond holders accordingly wintergreen intends to vote against  item  against each of the seven directors nominated for one year terms  item  against the ratification of the appointment of grant thornton llp as auditor  item  against the advisory vote to approve executive compensation  item  against the issuance of additional shares of cto wintergreen intends to vote for  item  for

incs the fund  results two related themes stick out in bold relief first theres simply no sure thing in this world  no sure winner no sure loser no sure outcome because of that investors need to be prepared for the unexpected owning undervalued companies that can survive if not thrive in a broad range of market conditions second every vote matters whether shareholder or citizen with that in mind we at wintergreen advisers look for companies that respect and live by good governance if we are invested and dont see that theres a good chance we will ask management to change or we will ask shareholders to join us in bringing about that change quite literally we are active managers the vote matters the fund had strong  returns from longterm portfolio holdings reynolds american inc reynolds birchcliff energy ltd and altria group inc securities that underperformed included canadian natural resources ltd which the fund sold during the year swatch group ag and provident financial plc the fund also employed forward currency contracts which had an overall positive impact on performance during the year if you would be a real seeker after truthit is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt as far as possible all things  rené descartes lets look at some highlights for the fund in last years annual letter we noted many virtues of reynolds as a core portfolio investment for many years a smart management team combined reynolds with lorillard inc in an earningsaccretive deal creating an even more powerful cash generating business in the process the company increased its appeal to british american tobacco plc bat its largest owner with  of outstanding shares as a mustown asset to fully capture opportunities in the us and benefit from reynoldss product innovations our belief that bat would eventually bid for the rest of the shares came to fruition last october resulting in a surge in the value of reynolds the funds largest holding with an improved deal price and structure more favorable to shareholders reynolds agreed to the takeover in january of  closing is expected by the adviser to occur in the third quarter of  as shareholders of bat another top
