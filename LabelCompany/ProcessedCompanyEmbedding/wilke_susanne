brings significant leadership sector and investing experience to neurotrope based upon her work at leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including hoffman la roche amgen and forest labs  dr wilke also served as a kaufman fellow at schroder ventures life sciences a leading international venture capital firm and was an investment principal at ngn capital we believe that she has a track record of identifying biotechnology companies with unique and promising drug candidates and then bringing them to public markets in order to access the depth of capital needed to develop clinical stage assets dr wilke holds a dual degree doctorate in both organic chemistry and biochemistry with an emphasis on drug development from the university of illinois at chicago   she also earned her mba from the tuck school of business at dartmouth college  dr wilke commented neurotropes lead drug bryostatin as well as related platform compounds have demonstrated their multimodal efficacy in preclinical models to induce the growth of new synaptic networks in degenerating brain tissue by activating pkc epsilon  it was demonstrated in these models that pkc epsilon appears to drive synaptogenesis via growth factors in the brain such as bdnf igf and ngf   at the same time the bryostatin and analogs seem to prevent amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles  dr wilke continued the same multimodal efficacy has been demonstrated for fragile x syndrome mental retardation in preclinical models  going forward we continue to build a strong team and are constructing a comprehensive business plan that will attempt to develop bryostatin and the pkc epsilon activating platform to potentially treat alzheimers disease and other areas of high unmet medical need such as fragile x syndrome and rett syndrome dr alkon chief scientific officer and a cofounder of neurotrope stated working with dr wilke first as a consultant and then as a board member during the past year i have found her input very insightful  she has applicable and relevant experience integrating scientific understanding with commercial and financial understanding and setting strategic clinical
