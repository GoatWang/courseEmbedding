historian of early modern britain he is noted for his work on the english civil war and the history of marriage families and the aristocracy contents  biography  storm over the gentry  family history  narrative history  works  references  further reading  external links biographyedit he was born in epsom surrey and received his education at charterhouse school – the sorbonne  and at oxford –  – where he was an undergraduate of christ church oxford during world war ii stone served in the royal naval volunteer reserve as a lieutenant he was a lecturer at university college oxford from  to  and a fellow of wadham college oxford from  to  in  he became dodge professor of history at princeton university until  he often reviewed for the new york review of books storm over the gentryedit stone began as a medievalist and his first book was the volume on medieval sculpture in britain for what is now the yale history of art series then the pelican history of art he was a bold choice by the series editor nicholas pevsner but the book was well received a  article was stones earliest ventures in quantitative study of the rise of the gentry and decline of the aristocracy along the lines that his mentor rh tawney had suggested in  he concluded there was a major economic crisis for the nobility in the th and th centuries stones argument was marred by methodological mistakes and he came under heavy attack from hugh trevorroper and others christopher thompson for example showed that the peerages real income was higher in  than in  and grew substantially by  many other scholars entered the fray and the issue became a central theme of english historiography stone in  summed up the causes of the english revolution by stressing three factors the crowns failure to gain an army or a bureaucracy the relative rise of the gentry in terms of status wealth education administrative experience group identity and political selfconfidence and the spread of puritanism rabb notes that few contemporary stuart historians would argue with stones assessment family historyedit stone moved from the study of the political importance of families to studies of their internal structure helping to open up the field of new social history in the family sex and marriage in england   stone used quantitative methods to study family life the book was very well received writing in the times literary supplement keith thomas described it as easily professor stones most ambitious book yet even though it comes from the pen of a historian who has by now produced some  pages in hard covers lawrence stone is one of the most buoyantly invigorating figures on the contemporary historical scene and his new work displays his usual attributes voracious reading a striking capacity for synthesis and an ability to write vivid continuously interesting prose he has offered an indispensable chart to a landscape which it will take at least another generation of historians to explore with any precision indeed the family sex and marriage is reminiscent of one of those pioneering maps from the age of discovery writing in the new york review of books j h plumb said professor stone raises vast issues settles them provocatively and underpins his solutions with a wealth of illustration joseph kett in the new york times book review said vast in theme exhaustive in research and with a cast of characters beyond counting the result is a veritable war and peace of social history truly this is scholarship on the grand scale some of his suggestions have been qualified by historians stones suggestion that affective individualism did not become widely characteristic of marriage until the th century was questioned by medievalists who pointed to evidence of loving marriages before  however it was never stones position that love in marriage did not exist before the th century and his book does not in fact say this stone was a major advocate of the new social history—that is using the methods of the social sciences to study history and expanding the target of study to include larger and larger populations stone argued that using quantitative methods to assemble data could lead to useful generalizations about different periods in time however stone never argued in favor of creating laws of history in the manner of karl marx or arnold j toynbee in stones view the most one could do was to create generalizations about a particular century and no more stone was very much interested in studying the mentalité of people in the early modern period along the lines of the annales school but stone rejected fernand braudels geographical theories as too simplistic along the same lines stone was very fond of combining history with anthropology and offering thick description in the manner of clifford geertz narrative historyedit according to stone narrative is the main rhetorical device traditionally used by historians in  at a time when social history of the previous generation was demanding a socialscience model of analysis stone detected a revivial in historiography of the narrative stone defined narrative as follows it is organized chronologically it is focused on a single coherent story it is descriptive rather than analytical it is concerned with people not abstract circumstances and it deals with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical he reported that more and more of the new historians are now trying to discover what was going on inside peoples heads in the past and what it was like to live in the past questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative stones methodology was mildly controversial stones supposed thesis that the british political elite was relatively closed to new members was widely accepted and popularized in works like simon schamas survey of the french revolution citizens a chronicle of the french revolution it has recently been challenged by ellis wassons born to rule british political elites  which argues that the ruling class was open to new members throughout the early modern period in fact stone never argued to the contrary and the difference appears to be one of

original billiken billiken stories florence pretz billiken lore gallery whats new links de laurence catalog  it is a wellknown fact that l w de laurence published books written by others sometimes under his own name without giving credit to the true authors  for example the pictorial key to the tarot and the riderwaite tarot decks were published by de laurence without giving any credit to either ae waite or pamela coleman smith  this reputation as a book pirate unfortunately overshadows his considerable contributions to occutlism and the related discipline of salesmanship de laurence wrote a lot of his own material in addition to his habit of borrowing and what he wrote best was ad copy  he managed to fill over  pages in his  catalog and it stands to this day as a monument to bombast   long before david ogilvy wrote his famous book on advertising l w de laurence had already determined that the more you tell the more you sell   the ad for his book the master key fills  pages and the ad for the book great magical art goes on for  pages  sworn testimonials price reductions free offers  these ads are masterpieces of salesmanship  de laurences techniques are used to this day particularly in direct mail advertising    the  catalog is divided into two parts the first half being the books for which de laurence was so infamous and the second half being magical rings jewelry spirit trumpets and other occult paraphernalia  the catalogs sales of incense products was particularly interesting from an historical perspective  we begin our review by showing the front cover logos and portraits of lw de laurence himself following are some images from the selection of incense that was offered by de laurence in  de laurence temple incense was the flagship brand  it came in two sizes large and extra large  the top image in the above page is enlarged below these images are from the label for de laurence temple incense de laurences oriental incense shows a beautiful art deco influence on the label  a pair of beautiful women crowned with egyptianstyled uraeus snakes and vultures pray to a chinesestyle buddha all held aloft by graecobabylonian lions in this advertisement in a fantastic blending of exotic imagery de laurences mystic rites incense was perfect for ceremonies and invocations and featured a dreamy oriental odor  dr faustus is seen on the label invoking demons in a necromantic rite while above a pyramid sends off rays of energy fair use statement the images and quotes from the de laurence catalog are a de minimus portion of the entire work and are presented here as part of a transformative educational essay on the use of catalogs to sell incense in the early years of the th century  the church of good luck does not profit in any
