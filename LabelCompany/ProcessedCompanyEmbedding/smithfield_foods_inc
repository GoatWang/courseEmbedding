bacon joseph w luter iii said that this produces high quality consistent products with consistent genetics luter has said that vertical integration gives you high quality consistent products with consistent genetics and the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant according to tyya n turner the company obtained  pigs and the right to their genetic lines from britains national pig development company in  and used them to create smithfield lean generation pork which was certified by the american heart association for its low fat salt and cholesterol content according to luter it was vertical integration that enabled this housing and lagoonsedit the pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs known as

afterbirths stillborn pigs drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains and the liners can be punctured by rocks smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons

being pulled by the snout shot in the head with a stun gun and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free the investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding staff jabbing them to make them move staff tossing piglets into carts and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits the video won a  webby award in the public service and activism category in response smithfield told the ap that it has zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal wellbeing procedures the company asked temple grandin a

conditions in the us meat and poultry industry in particular the report said workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries according to hrw the workers immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions the report cited working conditions in smithfield foods as an example according to the report the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers a smithfield manager testified in  during an unfair labor practices trial that at the tar heel plant in north carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of disassembly of an animal including draining cleaning and cleaving one worker told hrw that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives which means harder cuts have to be made with the resultant injuries to workers similar criticism was made

workers immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions the report cited working conditions in smithfield foods as an example according to the report the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers a smithfield manager testified in  during an unfair labor practices trial that at the tar heel plant in north carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of disassembly of an animal including draining cleaning and cleaving one worker told hrw that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives which means harder cuts have to be made with the resultant injuries to workers similar criticism was made by other groups about

human rights watch hrw issued a page report in  documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the us meat and poultry industry in particular the report said workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries according to hrw the workers immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions the report cited working conditions in smithfield foods as an example according to the report the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers a smithfield manager testified in  during an unfair labor practices trial that at the tar heel plant in north carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of disassembly of an animal including draining cleaning and cleaving one worker told hrw that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives which means harder cuts have to be made with the resultant injuries to workers similar criticism was made by other groups about smithfield facilities in poland and romania union disputeedit agriculture

from britains national pig development company in  and used them to create smithfield lean generation pork which was certified by the american heart association for its low fat salt and cholesterol content according to luter it was vertical integration that enabled this housing and lagoonsedit the pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs known as concentrated animal feeding operations cafos the floors of the buildings are slatted allowing waste to be flushed into feetdeep openair pits the size of two football fields referred to within the

afterbirths stillborn pigs drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains and the liners can be punctured by rocks smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons

conditions in the us meat and poultry industry in particular the report said workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries according to hrw the workers immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions the report cited working conditions in smithfield foods as an example according to the report the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers a smithfield manager testified in  during an unfair labor practices trial that at the tar heel plant in north carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of disassembly of an animal including draining cleaning and cleaving one worker told hrw that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives which means harder cuts have to be made with the resultant injuries to workers similar criticism was made

development company in  and used them to create smithfield lean generation pork which was certified by the american heart association for its low fat salt and cholesterol content according to luter it was vertical integration that enabled this housing and lagoonsedit the pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs known as concentrated animal feeding operations cafos the floors of the buildings are slatted allowing waste to be flushed into feetdeep openair pits the size of two football fields referred to within the industry as lagoons smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage according to jeff tietz writing for rolling stone the waste—a mixture of excrement urine blood afterbirths stillborn pigs drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains and the liners can be punctured by rocks smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons writing that the color is a sign of bacteria

vertical integration in  the company bought hogfarming operations making it a vertically integrated company the system allows smithfield to control every stage of pig production from conception and birth to slaughter processing and packing—known as from squeal to meal or from birth to bacon joseph w luter iii said that this produces high quality consistent products with consistent genetics luter has said that vertical integration gives you high quality consistent products with consistent genetics and the only way to do that is to control the process from the farm to the packing plant according to tyya n turner the company obtained  pigs and the right to their genetic lines from britains national pig development company in  and used them to create smithfield lean generation pork which was certified by the american heart association for its low fat salt and cholesterol content according to luter it was vertical integration that enabled this housing and lagoonsedit the pigs are housed together in their thousands in identical barns with metal roofs known as concentrated animal feeding operations cafos the floors of the buildings are slatted allowing waste to be flushed into feetdeep openair pits the size of two football fields referred to within the industry as lagoons smithfield says the lagoons contain an impervious liner made to withstand leakage according to jeff tietz writing for rolling stone the waste—a mixture of excrement urine blood afterbirths stillborn pigs drugs and other chemicals—overflows when it rains and the liners can be punctured by rocks smithfield attributes the pink color of the waste to the health of the lagoons writing that the color is a sign of bacteria doing what it should be doing its indicative of lower odor and lower

smithfield foods facility the investigator had worked for a month at murphybrown a smithfield subsidiary in waverly virginia the associated press ap reported that the investigator videotaped  sows living in gestation crates according to the ap the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout shot in the head with a stun gun and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free the investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding staff jabbing them to make them move staff tossing piglets into carts and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits the video won a  webby award in the public service and activism category in response smithfield told the ap that it has zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our

a page report in  documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the us meat and poultry industry in particular the report said workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries according to hrw the workers immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions the report cited working conditions in smithfield foods as an example according to the report the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers a smithfield manager testified in  during an unfair labor practices trial that at the tar heel plant in north carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of disassembly of an animal including draining cleaning and cleaving one worker told hrw that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives which means harder cuts have to be made with the resultant injuries to workers similar criticism was made by other groups about smithfield facilities in poland and romania union disputeedit agriculture history history of organic farming arab

december  the humane society of the united states hsus released an undercover video taken by one of its investigators inside a smithfield foods facility the investigator had worked for a month at murphybrown a smithfield subsidiary in waverly virginia the associated press ap reported that the investigator videotaped  sows living in gestation crates according to the ap the material shows a pig being pulled by the snout shot in the head with a stun gun and thrown into a bin while trying to wriggle free the investigator said he saw sows biting their crates and bleeding staff jabbing them to make them move staff tossing piglets into carts and piglets born prematurely in gestation crates falling through the slats into the manure pits the video won a  webby award in the public service and activism category in response smithfield told the ap that it has zero tolerance for any behavior that does not conform to our established animal wellbeing procedures the company asked temple grandin a professor of animal husbandry to review the footage she recommended an inspection by animal welfare expert jennifer woods smithfield announced on december  that it had fired two workers and their supervisor at the companys invitation the virginia state veterinarian richard wilkes visited the facility on december  he told the virginianpilot that smithfield had been very responsive and very

provided the vet with a preannounced white glove tour legal and labor issuesedit working conditionsedit human rights watch hrw issued a page report in  documenting what it said were unsafe work conditions in the us meat and poultry industry in particular the report said workers make thousands of repetitive motions with knives during each shift leading to lacerations and repetitive strain injuries according to hrw the workers immigrant status may be exploited to prevent them from making complaints or forming unions the report cited working conditions in smithfield foods as an example according to the report the speed at which the pigs are killed and processed makes the job inherently dangerous for workers a smithfield manager testified in  during an unfair labor practices trial that at the tar heel plant in north carolina it takes between five and ten minutes to slaughter and complete the process of disassembly of an animal including draining cleaning and cleaving one worker told hrw that the disassembly line moves so fast that there is no time to sharpen the knives which means harder cuts have to be made with the resultant injuries to workers similar criticism was made

list of smithfield foods subsidiaries and brands june   smithfield we all heard the brief media sound bites last week announcing the sale of america’s largest meat producer smithfield foods to a chinese corporation what we didn’t hear were the details warnings or implications of this recordbreaking transfer of us assets to the peoples republic of china below is a complete list of smithfield foods brands and subsidiaries that would be transferred to chinese ownership chinas river of dead pigs image courtesy of scoopitcomfirst it should be noted that the chinese buyout of smithfield foods is far from assured the sale must first be approved by the committee on foreign investments a highly secret federal commission chaired by the secretary of the treasury and if past chinese offers are any indication there is little legitimate chance of smithfield foods acquisition by china being approved but with billions of dollars trading hands and goldman sachs lurking in the shadows it might just happen shuanghui international aka shineway shuanghui international is a pork processing company located in the peoples republic of china it was created in  by local chinese government agencies to help streamline the production and availability of pork products to the evergrowing chinese population in  the company transitioned from a singlelocation food distributor to what would become the largest food producer in china in  the chinese government sold its ownership share in shuanghui to an investment partnership led by goldman sachs soon thereafter goldman sachs sold most of its ownership to other investors keeping a minority stake for itself in  with the help of sachs the company began talks to buy america’s largest meat producer – smithfield foods by  shuanghui was being accused of taking production shortcuts that put the health and lives of the chinese people in jeopardy in  chinese state tv announced that the company had been caught treating its animals with the banned chemical clenbuterol in the us clenbuterol is only approved by the fda for use in prescription respiratory inhalers like those used by asthma victims in animals where its use is banned for human consumption the drug acts as a stimulant and fatburner on may   shuanghui announced it had made a  billion bid to purchase smithfield foods smithfield’s corporate officers as well as its investors stand to make a great deal of money from the sale the purchase price is  more than the corporation’s market value at the time of the announcement promises and safety the biggest irony of the announced sale is the reasoning being given by corporate spokespeople on both sides of the deal china’s pork industry has been devastated in recent years by scandals involving tainted meat chinese consumers routinely avoid chinese produced pork in favor of higher priced but safer foreign imports in fact while the uschina trade deficit has been onesided in china’s favor for decades pork is one area where imports outnumber exports in the communist nation so while the chinese people purchase foreignproduced meats the chinese corporation guilty of tainting the country’s meat in the first place buys the foreign pork producers and takes over their operations one of two scenarios is going to come to fruition either us safety standards will prevail and china will have safe pork to consume or the us will adopt china’s safety standards and the us meat supply will become tainted the empire that is smithfield foods smithfield foods is the largest meat producer in the united states its corporate family is so large it’s almost impossible to find a complete list of the corporation’s brands and subsidiaries but that’s exactly what we at whiteout press spent the better part of a week attempting to do we knew the company was big but we didn’t know just how big remarkably between partownerships and the rapidfire purchases and sales of smaller companies it’s difficult to put together an accurate and current list but we did the best we could our first stop was the smithfield foods website there the corporation displays ‘our brands’ but if one were to believe the company they only have  nowhere on the corporate website is a full list of the company’s brands and subsidiaries we next took our search to the securities and exchange commission there we found what appeared to be a complete list of smithfield subsidiaries unfortunately while the sec does provide a full list of companies owned by the mammoth corporation it does not include a listing of each of their full assortment of brands smithfield foods subsidiaries and brands from the sec and smithfield foods websites agprotein inc agri ai sp zoo agri plus sp zoo agri plus wielkopolska sa agri vet sp zoo
