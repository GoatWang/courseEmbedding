equity is raised from retail and institutional investors and can be used to fund new technologies expand working capital within an owned company make acquisitions or to strengthen a balance sheet the majority of private equity consists of institutional investors and accredited investors who can commit large sums of money for long periods of time private equity investments often demand long holding periods to allow for a turnaround of a distressed company or a liquidity event such as an ipo or sale to a public company listed private equity lpe companies are publicly traded vehicles that generally invest capital in privately held businesses they may also take positions of significant influence andor control in publicly traded businesses the model and structure can be similar to those of traditional private equity funds except that lpe companies are publicly traded in the open market simply stated lpe is a different approach to accessing the same asset class red rocks capital has identified a global investment universe of over  private equity companies and funds with an aggregate market capitalization of over  billion which represents over  of the total global private equity universe of  trillion investopedia preqin january  characteristics some common characteristics of listed private equity lpe include lpe is an ownership interest in a set of investments that are traded in the open market on recognized financial exchanges every day these ownership interests are no different than what an investor in a traditional private equity partnership might hold investments in a set of businesses with the objective of maximizing total return at the end of an investment period lpe vehicles are structured as common equity or shares units in investment trusts or units in publicly traded limited partnership interests lpe vehicles typically take the form of direct private equity investments fund of fund private equity investments both primary and secondary fund interests along with their future funding commitments or an interest in the management company that oversees various investment fundsbusiness units listed private equity vehicles can also be some combination of the above or a hybrid lpe is a permanent pool of capital once raised the capital of a listed private equity vehicle is recycled from one deal to the next this represents a significant difference in the business model for a private equity manager and offers options not available through traditional limited partnerships an lpe company may also offer traditional limited partnershipbased funds that they manage alongside the lpe vehicle in this instance the private equity company is investing both the lpe vehicle’s capital along with the limited partnershipbased fund’s capital in the same deals or businesses at the same time on the same terms thereby leveraging the deal flow due diligence and ongoing work of the private equity managers for the benefit of both vehicles lpe vehicles can be structured to focus on senior loans mezzanine debt or securedunsecured debt investments in some cases a private equity manager may have an lpe equity vehicle that focuses on the debt side of the capital structure along with a traditional limited partnershipbased funds that invests in the equity side of a deal the lpe vehicle may invest in the senior loan mezzanine debt or securedunsecured debt in a deal while the traditional limited partnershipbased funds invests in the equity side of the same deal benefits potential benefits of the listed private equity lpe market

investment early mid late and reduce exposure to the ‘j curve’ effect the point where traditional private equity funds reach breakeven investment horizon private investment funds or partnerships typically have a fixed life of  years lpe companies are perpetual investment vehicles with no set life therefore investments and liquidity decisions are based on the goal of maximizing long term return for shareholders liquidity lpe companies are traded on public markets and offer a high level of liquidity whereas private equity funds are typically purchased at the beginning of the funds life investors in traditional private equity funds are usually paid back through distributions over the life of that fund additionally the structure of traditional private equity funds makes withdrawing an investment prior to the end of the funds life difficult longterm investment unlike private funds which have a predetermined life span that often requires them to distribute proceeds at set points in time lpe companies choose to reinvest or distribute proceeds from liquidated investments based on current market opportunities pricing private equity funds and partnerships are typically priced quarterly and usually take  months for valuationsprices to be determined pricing of investments within private funds are generally not scrutinized to the same degree or held to the same standards as publicly traded private equity companies within private funds there is great resistance to quickly mark investment values ﻿﻿upward or downward reasonable feesmanagers of private equity funds typically charge fees based on total committed capital or fund size regardless of whether investments are made and are not as impacted by performance of investments listed private equity companies typically
