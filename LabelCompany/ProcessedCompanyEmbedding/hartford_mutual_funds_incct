be all about the numbers it’s not it’s about much more it’s about investors it’s about advisors it’s about relationships confidence and trust that’s why our approach is something we call humancentric investing humancentric investing works to understand the relationships between investors their money and their financial advisors…and then create the products and advisor tools designed to serve those investors and their mindsets we believe that humancentric investing can create products and advisor tools that not only strengthen bottom lines but strengthen advisorclient relationships by helping investors better realize their true life goals hartford funds has  billion total assets under management as of march   excluding assets used in certain annuity products our lineup includes more than  mutual funds in a variety of styles and asset classes and five strategic beta etfs and two active etfs our mutual funds with the exception of certain fund of funds are primarily subadvised by wellington management company llp or schroder investment management north america inc two institutional managers with comprehensive global investment capabilities the strategic beta etfs offered by hartford funds are designed to help address investors evolving needs by leveraging a distinct riskoptimized approach which identifies risks within each asset class and then deliberately and systematically reallocates capital toward risks more likely to enhance return potential no matter the asset class or type of fund hartford funds will always strive to meet or exceed traditional industry benchmarks but through humancentric investing we intend to also raise the bar on performance and make it mean more than numbers alone because at hartford funds…   our benchmark is the
