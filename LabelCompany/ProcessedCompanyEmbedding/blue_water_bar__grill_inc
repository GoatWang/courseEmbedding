concern opinion in their audit report dated april   which can be found in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on april   this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months we do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we are able to open our first restaurant which is presently under construction in st maarten dutch west indies accordingly we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations to meet our need for cash we are continually exploring new sources of financing including raising funds through a secondary public offering a private placement of securities andor loans if we are unable to secure additional financing we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in this quarterly report as filed with the sec on form q limited operating history need for additional capital there is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance we are an emerging growth business with limited operating history we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns such as increases in marketing costs increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations increases in accounting and audit fees and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance to become profitable and competitive we have to successfully open operating restaurant properties throughout the caribbean region we anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses which may never happen issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders there is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities we are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans we cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations further future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders plan of operations blue water was incorporated under the laws of the state of colorado on june   under the name stream flow media inc on october   an amendment to the articles of incorporation was filed changing the corporation name to blue water bar  grill inc blue water is currently developing a chain of casual dining restaurants in popular tourist destinations throughout the caribbean region under the blue water bar  grilltm brand name the initial flagship location is presently under construction in st maarten dutch west indies the projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurant may differ significantly in addition to the foregoing and unless otherwise noted all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates which could have a negative impact on our overall business cause our business to fail and result in you losing all of your investment blue water bar  grilltm the blue water bar  grilltm restaurant concept is the perfectly caribbeansm experience featuring a casual open air caribbean themed restaurant designed to offer customers a distinctive and relaxing island dining experience central to each restaurant will be a large covered outside patio area where customers can enjoy their drinks and food while overlooking a beautiful water view the patio area will feature an inviting island styled walk up and in some cases swim up bar and a small stage area for live musical performances by local musicians and dancing each restaurant will begin serving breakfast at am on weekends the restaurant will promote an american styled breakfast buffet and feature a doityourself bloody mary station lunch service will commence at am and will feature handmade burgers gourmet sandwiches and salads and caribbean jerk styled dishes dinner service will start at pm and will feature handcut aged certified angus steaks and prime rib fresh seafood caught by local fishermen hand tossed pizzas and specialty homemade desserts the restaurant will close at pm nightly and the bar will close later at the managers discretion during weekdays the bar will host a daily happy hour pm  pm that will offer reduced priced drinks and appetizer specials when the sun sets the patio will be outlined by tiki torches which will promote a fun nighttime island atmosphere while helping ward off unwanted insects such as mosquitoes in addition each restaurant will offer its customers specialty drinks in souvenir glasses mugs and shot glasses that come with the drink these items along with fun and unique tshirts and other souvenirs will be available for retail purchase in a separate souvenir hut that will be approximately  square feet in size these souvenir items will be primarily marketed to the tourist customers based on our preliminary discussions with an importer of these types of souvenir items we estimate selling this merchandise at a    retail markup depending on the particular item st maarten blue water bar  grilltm in february  blue water broke ground on its first blue water bar  grilltm in st maarten dutch west indies the beachfront building site is located in the pristine ecofriendly indigo bay development and is the second restaurant approved for beachfront construction more information about the indigo bay development be found through their website at wwwindigobaycom key elements to the design and site location include � blue waters building site lot l measures approximately  square meters  square feet and is located on a picturesque white sand beach � this blue water bar  grilltm location will feature a large openaired tiki roof swimming pool with swim up bar stools two fire pits and beach and pool lounge chairs with full drink and food service � the restaurants foot print measures approximately  square meters  square feet and seats up to  people �  under the main tiki roof  under tropical cover  at the bar and  at the swim up bar � indigo bay is an ecofriendly commercial and residential development encompassing approximately  acres of lush tropical and beachfront land � indigo bay is st maartens newest and closest attraction to the port of st maarten and is just a quick ride by water taxi for cruise ship passengers � approximate gps coordinates  north and  west keys for success to better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants create a fun energetic destination drinking and dining experience we wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can if they choose to do so openly interact with one another topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from what activities have they done while on the island and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice we intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere and more intimate dining tables will be located further in the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere we believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal new customers  tourists local expatriots and native locals alike  will become repeat or regular customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by wordofmouth to their friends and family distinctive concept in each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service dining offerings and daily entertainment the restaurants concept will be carried throughout our customers entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience including the exterior design of the building interior layout and decorum employee greetings and uniforms specialty drinks and menu items and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant tshirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home comfortable adult atmosphere our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated while children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit no one under  years of age or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute will be allowed into our restaurants after pm we believe that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations high standard of customer service because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another  and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers  we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees ranging from the general manager to the greeters through intense training cross training for all manager level employees and a oneweek training course complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings operational procedures and computer checkout for all other employees constant monitoring from the onduty manager and surprise visits from secret shoppers and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions from the moment a customer walks into the front door we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable energetic staff bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform flare techniques flipping tossing and twirling of liquor bottles for our customers entertainment greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them provide dining value we believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting high quality and generously portioned covering the entire plate menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied complementing the dining aspect we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurants overall concept it is our goal to generate at least a us average check per guest inclusive of food and drinks we estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of  food and  drinks we anticipate achieving and maintaining a  food cost and  liquor cost which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates for example if we sold a fish entree for  our actual cost would be  and our gross profit would be  prices for entrees will start at around  for a hamburger and rise to  for a prime rib steak dinner prices for drinks will start at  for beer  for basic well mixed drinks and  for specialty drinks these price points are competitive with the existing restaurants our management team has scouted in the simpson bay area of st maarten dutch west indies where we intend to open our first blue water bar  grilltm that will cater to the tourist and local expatriot alike it is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or if achieved will be able to maintain them operations and management our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants annual gross sales of us or more with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success in order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of and adherence to high standards relating to personnel performance food and beverage preparation entertainment productions and equipment and maintenance of the restaurant facilities we believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years while staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager a kitchen manager who also serves as the head chef and a bar manager who also serves as the head bartender the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is offduty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities recruiting we will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees regardless of their prospective position we will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary bonuses for achieving performance objectives and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year for example the general manager in our initial blue water bar  grilltm restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of  a month plus up to  a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food liquor and labor costs as determined by our executive management team in addition all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants training we believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service each new management hire will go through an extensive training program which will include crosstraining in all management duties all nonmanagement new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings operational procedures and our pointofsale pos computer system management information systems mis all of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems these systems will include an easytouse pointofsale pos computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations controls cash handles credit card authorizations keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes and provides onsite and executive level management with realtime sales and inventory data additionally we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis further daily weekly and monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants by closely monitoring each restaurants gross sales cost of sales labor and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs inventory levels and identify problems with individual operations if any early on secret shopper because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success we intend to implement a secret shopper program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food drink and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurants management or employees secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management longterm growth plan  years over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new blue water bar  grilltm restaurant each year aside from the blue water bar  grilltm currently under development in st maarten dutch west indies we have also identified the following caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a blue water bar  grilltm restaurant � aruba dutch west indies � nassau bahamas � cozumel mexico � grand cayman and � barbados we estimate that we will need to raise an aggregate of between    million to open the proposed restaurants on each of the listed caribbean islands this capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders sales and marketing our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues we intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers those living on the island while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship we intend to accomplish this through � grand opening promotions � traditional paid advertising eg radio television newspaper etc � free media exposure eg hosting charity events food reviews etc and � working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives taxi association bus association day sail and charter businesses etc when opening a new blue water bar  grilltm restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders media personalities hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff and tourism bureau representatives inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotelresort industry representatives afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods including radio and television spots newspaper ads billboards and road signs and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons if our strategy is successful it will lead to word of mouth referrals which is our ultimate goal this is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks while we do not have a fixed marketing budget we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than  of the restaurants annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue financing we are presently seeking additional sources of capital necessary for us to achieve our stated business objectives and meet our projected expenditures over the next  months and beyond however we can provide no assurances that any such financing can be obtained or if obtained on terms favorable to us if we are unable to generate profits or unable to obtain additional funds to meet our working capital needs we may need to cease or curtail our business operations government regulation the restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which typically include health safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located the development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location which is normally subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations further our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages health insurance requirements working conditions citizenship and work permit requirements and mandatory overtime pay all of which will directly affect our labor costs additionally because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time these regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages the failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location which could subsequently impact our businesss overall revenues and ability to achieve and if achieved maintain profitability compliance with environmental laws we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws patents and trademarks we are presently using the following trademarks and service marks blue water bar  grill and perfectly

financial information and the instructions to form q and rule  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by gaap for complete financial statements in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included   the condensed balance sheet as of december   has been derived from audited financial statements   operating results for the three and nine months ended september   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending

assurance that once open the companys restaurants will be well received or that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund continued operations   the above factors raise

concern and do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of tiger reef inc and its wholly owned subsidiary tiger reef ltd hereafter referred collectively as the  company  or  tiger reef  all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimates the accompanying financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment  actual results may vary from these estimates  cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows the company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  as of september   and december   the company had no cash equivalents property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost  depreciation and amortization are provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally  to  years  leasehold improvements and leased equipment are amortized over the shorter of the term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement or equipment fair value of financial instruments asc  fair value measurements and asc  financial instruments requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  it establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value  a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  it prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value level   description       level    applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level    applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data

total liabilities         net loss per share calculation basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period   diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive  as of september   and  the company had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding revenue recognition the company follows the guidance of fasb asc topic  for revenue recognition  in general the company recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured  determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees  revenue is generally recognized at the time of sale and is expected to consist of sales of food beverages and general merchandise and souvenirs discontinued operations the company follows the policy of segregating the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries or lines of business on its balance sheet from the assets and liabilities of continuing subsidiaries or lines of business when it is decided to close or dispose of a subsidiary or line of business  the company also follows the policy of separately disclosing the assets and liabilities and the net operations of a subsidiary or line of business in its financial statements when it is decided to close or dispose of a subsidiary or line of business income taxes the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to fasb asc  income taxes  under fasb asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences   the company maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets  the company establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration the companys financial position and results of operations for the current period  future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the federal tax laws    changes in circumstances such as the company generating taxable income could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related deferred tax asset  any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate fiscal year the company elected december st for its fiscal year end recent accounting pronouncements there are various updates recently issued most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows note   going concern the accompanying consolidated financial

accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated march   which can be found in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission  sec  on march    this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months  we do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we are able to open our first restaurant  accordingly we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations to meet our need for cash we are continually exploring new sources of financing including raising funds through a secondary public offering a private placement of securities andor loans  if we are unable to secure additional financing we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in this quarterly report as filed with the sec on form q limited operating history need for additional capital there is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance  we are an emerging growth business with limited operating history  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations  our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns such as increases in marketing costs increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations increases in accounting and audit fees and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance   to become profitable and competitive we have to successfully open operating restaurant properties throughout the caribbean region and have our ultra premium rums available to consumers worldwide  we anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses which may never happen  issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders  there is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities   we are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans  we cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful  we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations  further future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders plan of operations tiger reef was incorporated under the laws of the state of colorado on june   under the name stream flow media inc  we amended our articles of incorporation on october   to change our name to blue water bar  grill inc and further amended its articles of incorporation on october   to change its name to tiger reef inc  tiger reef is a diversified producer of ultra premium rums under the tiger reef® brand and a developer of casual dining restaurant properties in the caribbean the projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurants may differ significantly in addition to the foregoing and unless otherwise noted all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management  our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates which could have a negative impact on our overall business cause our business to fail and result in you losing all of your investment  tiger reef® ultra premium rums tiger reef has worked closely with a distinguished and multiaward winning cuban maestro ronero master rum maker to formulate three new and very special ultra premium rums specifically for the us market  these rums will be produced and bottled in the dominican republic and are expected to be available to us consumers as early as summer  casual dining caribbean restaurants tiger reef is currently in discussions for a leased restaurant space on the island of st maarten  tiger reef anticipates these discussions will result in an executed lease agreement sometime in q   updates on these material discussions and the ultimate caribbean restaurant concept will be provided to shareholders in a timely manner keys for success to better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants create a fun energetic destination drinking and dining experience   we wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can if they choose to do so openly interact with one another  topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from what activities have they done while on the island and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice  we intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere and more intimate dining tables will be located further in the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere  we believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal new customers  tourists local expatriots and native locals alike  will become repeat or regular customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by wordofmouth to their friends and family distinctive concept   in each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service dining offerings and daily entertainment  the restaurants concept will be carried throughout our customers entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience including the exterior design of the building interior layout and decorum employee greetings and uniforms specialty drinks and menu items and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant tshirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home comfortable adult atmosphere   our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated  while children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit no one under  years of age or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute will be allowed into our restaurants after pm  we believe that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations high standard of customer service   because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another  and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers  we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees ranging from the general manager to the greeters through intense training cross training for all manager level employees and a oneweek training course complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings operational procedures and computer checkout for all other employees constant monitoring from the onduty manager and surprise visits from secret shoppers and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions  from the moment a customer walks into the front door we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable energetic staff  bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform flare techniques flipping tossing and twirling of liquor bottles for our customers entertainment greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them provide dining value   we believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting high quality and generously portioned covering the entire plate menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied  complementing the dining aspect we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurants overall concept  it is our goal to generate at least a us average check per guest inclusive of food and drinks  we estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of   food and  drinks  we anticipate achieving and maintaining a  food cost and  liquor cost which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates  for example if we sold a fish entree for  our actual cost would be  and our gross profit would be   prices for entrees will start at around  for a hamburger and rise to  for a prime rib steak dinner prices for drinks will start at  for beer  for basic well mixed drinks and  for specialty drinks it is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or if achieved will be able to maintain them operations and management our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants annual gross sales of us or more with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success  in order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of and adherence to high standards relating to personnel performance food and beverage preparation entertainment productions and equipment and maintenance of the restaurant facilities  we believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years  while staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager a kitchen manager who also serves as the head chef and a bar manager who also serves as the head bartender the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is offduty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities recruiting   we will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service  our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees regardless of their prospective position  we will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary bonuses for achieving performance objectives and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year  for example the general manager in our initial restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of  a month plus up to  a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food liquor and labor costs as determined by our executive management team  in addition all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants training   we believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service  each new management hire will go through an extensive training program which will include crosstraining in all management duties  all nonmanagement new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings operational procedures and our pointofsale pos computer system management information systems mis   all of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems  these systems will include an easytouse pointofsale pos computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations controls cash handles credit card authorizations keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes and provides onsite and executive level management with realtime sales and inventory data  additionally we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program  physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis  further daily weekly and monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants  by closely monitoring each restaurants gross sales cost of sales labor and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs inventory levels and identify problems with individual operations if any early on secret shopper   because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success we intend to implement a secret shopper program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants  secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food drink and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurants management or employees  secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management longterm growth plan  years ultra premium rums over the next five years we plan to expand and grow the tiger reef® brand of ultra premium rums into new territories including  · asia · european union · caribbean region · australia and · india caribbean restaurants over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new caribbean restaurant each year  we have also identified the following caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a caribbean restaurant · st maarten dutch west indies · aruba dutch west indies · nassau bahamas · cozumel mexico · grand cayman and · barbados we estimate that we will need to raise approximately  million to achieve the above listed goals and milestones  this capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders sales and marketing our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues  we intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers those living on the island while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship  we intend to accomplish this through · grand opening promotions   · traditional paid advertising eg radio television newspaper etc · free media exposure eg hosting charity events food reviews etc and · working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives taxi association bus association day sail and charter businesses etc when opening a new restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders media personalities hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff and tourism bureau representatives inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotelresort industry representatives  our goal with courting these groups is to introduce them to our concept and court them to refer new customers to our restaurants and provide us with free future media exposure afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods including radio and television spots newspaper ads billboards and road signs and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons if our strategy is successful it will lead to word of mouth referrals which is our ultimate goal  this is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks while we do not have a fixed marketing budget we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than  of the restaurants annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue   financing in order to proceed with our longterm plans we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between  million in additional longterm financing  we presently do not have an established or dependable source of financing  currently we are exploring various sources of new financing to meet our basic working capital needs and provide for our planned capital expenditures  without limiting our available options future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock  it is possible that we could also offer warrants options andor rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock  however we can give no assurance that sufficient financing will be available to us and if available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if we are unable to obtain additional funds to meet our basic working capital needs we may need to cease or curtail our business operations   government regulation the restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations  each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which typically include health safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located  the development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location which is normally subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations  further our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages health insurance requirements working conditions citizenship and work permit requirements and mandatory overtime pay all of which will directly affect our labor costs additionally because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale  typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis  such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time  these regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages   the failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location which could subsequently impact our businesss overall revenues and ability to achieve and if achieved maintain profitability

 quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable since we are a smaller reporting company item   controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures for the period covered by this report we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and sole director j scott sitra we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de of the exchange act a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be presented or detected on a timely basis based on managements assessment we have concluded that as of september   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting management to the material information relating to us required to be included in our annual and interim filings with the sec management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures had the following material weaknesses · we were unable to maintain any segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function  while this control deficiency has not resulted in any audit adjustments to our  interim or annual financial statements it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties   · tiger reef lacks sufficient resources to perform the internal audit function and does not have an audit committee · we do not have an independent board of directors nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert to tiger reef  the board of directors is comprised of one  member who also serves as tiger reefs principal executive officer  as a result there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team lack of independent review of our operating and financial results and lack of independent review of disclosures made by tiger reef and · documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete these weaknesses have existed since our inception on june   and as of september   have not been remedied to the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned material weaknesses including but not limited to the following · considering the engagement of consultants to assist in ensuring that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures   · hiring additional qualified financial personnel including a chief financial officer on a fulltime basis · expanding our current board of directors to include additional independent individuals willing to perform directorial functions and · increasing our workforce in preparation for exiting the development stage and commencing revenue producing operations since the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel these material weaknesses may not be overcome in the nearterm due to our limited financial resources  until such remedial actions can be realized we will continue to rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants changes in controls and procedures there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting part ii item   legal proceedings during the past ten years no director person nominated to become a director or executive officer or promoter of tiger reef has been involved in any legal proceeding that would require disclosure hereunder from time to time we may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities  however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties for which the outcome cannot be predicted  any adverse result in these or other legal matters could arise and cause harm to our business  we currently are not party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which

independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated march   which can be found in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission  sec  on march    this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months  we do not anticipate generating significant revenues until we are able to open our first restaurant  accordingly we must raise additional cash from sources other than operations to meet our need for cash we are continually exploring new sources of financing including raising funds through a secondary public offering a private placement of securities andor loans  if we are unable to secure additional financing we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other information included in this quarterly report as filed with the sec on form q limited operating history need for additional capital there is limited historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance  we are an emerging growth business with limited operating history  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations  our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns such as increases in marketing costs increases in administration expenditures associated with daily operations increases in accounting and audit fees and increases in legal fees related to filings and regulatory compliance   to become profitable and competitive we have to successfully open operating restaurant properties throughout the caribbean region  we anticipate relying on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations until we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses which may never happen  issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our then existing stockholders  there is no assurance that we will be able to make any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned business activities   we are continually exploring new sources of financing to meet our need for additional cash including raising funds through sales of our equity securities and loans  we cannot provide any assurances that our efforts to secure additional financing will be successful  we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations  further future equity financing could result in additional and substantial dilution to existing shareholders plan of operations blue water was incorporated under the laws of the state of colorado on june   under the name stream flow media inc  we amended our articles of incorporation on october   to change our name to blue water bar  grill inc  subsequent to the name change blue water acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of blue water bar  grill nv a st maarten dutch west indies limited liability company on december    presently we are developing a chain of casual dining restaurants in popular tourist destinations throughout the caribbean region under the blue water bar  grill brand name the projected costs and other related expenses are estimates made by our management and our actual costs related to opening our proposed restaurants may differ significantly in addition to the foregoing and unless otherwise noted all of the cost estimates and forecasts throughout our business plan are mere estimates made by our management  our actual costs related to opening and operating the proposed restaurants may differ significantly from our estimates which could have a negative impact on our overall business cause our business to fail and result in you losing all of your investment  blue water bar  grill the blue water bar  grill restaurant concept is the perfectly caribbean sm experience featuring a casual open air caribbean themed restaurant designed to offer customers a distinctive and relaxing island dining experience  central to each restaurant will be a large covered outside patio area where customers can enjoy their drinks and food while overlooking a beautiful water view  the patio area will feature an inviting island styled walk up and in some cases swim up bar and a small stage area for live musical performances by local musicians and dancing  each restaurant will have an open aired kitchen so customers can see their food being prepared each restaurant will begin serving breakfast at am  on weekends the restaurant will promote an american styled breakfast buffet and feature a doityourself bloody mary station  lunch service will commence at am and will feature handmade burgers gourmet sandwiches and salads and caribbean jerk styled dishes  dinner service will start at pm and will feature handcut aged certified angus steaks and prime rib fresh seafood caught by local fishermen hand tossed pizzas and specialty homemade desserts  the restaurant will close at pm nightly and the bar will close later at the managers discretion during weekdays the bar will host a daily happy hour pm  pm that will offer reduced priced drinks and appetizer specials  when the sun sets the patio will be outlined by tiki torches which will promote a fun nighttime island atmosphere while helping ward off unwanted insects such as mosquitoes in addition each restaurant will offer its customers specialty drinks in souvenir glasses mugs and shot glasses that come with the drink  these items along with fun and unique tshirts and other souvenirs will be available for retail purchase in a separate souvenir hut that will be approximately  square feet in size  these souvenir items will be primarily marketed to the tourist customers  based on our preliminary discussions with an importer of these types of souvenir items we estimate selling this merchandise at a    retail markup depending on the particular item keys for success to better achieve our business objectives and successfully compete with other restaurants we have developed the following focal points and strategies we anticipate implementing in all of our future restaurants create a fun energetic destination drinking and dining experience   we wish to create and promote a fun and socially open atmosphere whereby our customers can if they choose to do so openly interact with one another  topics of discussion and frequent interest will often center around where each other is from what activities have they done while on the island and giving and receiving recommendations for future activities while on the island sometimes the floor and bar staff will participate in these discussions and offer their own words of advice  we intend to accomplish this by utilizing sectional floor and foot traffic planning whereby the bar area will promote social interaction among customers a stage area will feature local live entertainment performers to create a lively and festive atmosphere and more intimate dining tables will be located further in the back to provide separation for those who just wish to dine alone and enjoy the island atmosphere  we believe that if we are successful at achieving this goal new customers  tourists local expatriots and native locals alike  will become repeat or regular customers and subsequently promote the restaurant by wordofmouth to their friends and family distinctive concept   in each restaurant we wish to create a fun and consistent experience for our customers centered around our full bar service dining offerings and daily entertainment  the restaurants concept will be carried throughout our customers entire visit and will involve all aspects of the experience including the exterior design of the building interior layout and decorum employee greetings and uniforms specialty drinks and menu items and fun and creative souvenirs such as interestingly shaped drink glasses and bright and flamboyant tshirts that can remind the customer of their vacation or make an excellent gift for someone back home comfortable adult atmosphere   our restaurants will be primarily adult orientated  while children will be welcomed during daytime hours as long as they are accompanied by a responsible adult at all times during their visit no one under  years of age or the minimum legal drinking age as established by statute will be allowed into our restaurants after pm  we believe that this policy will help maintain a fun and relaxed atmosphere that appeals to adult customers and will help attract groups such as private parties and business organizations high standard of customer service   because service is one the key areas restaurants differentiate themselves from one another  and a constant source of either compliments or complaints from customers  we intend to foster a high level of customer service among our employees ranging from the general manager to the greeters through intense training cross  training for all manager level employees and a oneweek training course complete with required testing on all food and drink offerings operational procedures and computer checkout for all other employees constant monitoring from the onduty manager and surprise visits from secret shoppers and emphasizing consideration of our customers first and foremost in all decisions  from the moment a customer walks into the front door we want them to experience a high level of guest service provided by a knowledgeable energetic staff  bar tenders will be required to be able to free pour simultaneously from multiple liquor bottles and perform flare techniques flipping tossing and twirling of liquor bottles for our customers entertainment greeters and servers will be required to introduce customers to the concept explain the drink and entree menus and daily specials and generally set the stage for a fun and memorable experience for them provide dining value   we believe that our restaurants should provide our customers with interesting high quality and generously portioned covering the entire plate menu items that are aesthetically appealing and result in the customer leaving fully satisfied  complementing the dining aspect we intend to offer the customer a unique variety of original drinks each designed to perpetuate and immerse the customer in the restaurants overall concept  it is our goal to generate at least a us average check per guest inclusive of food and drinks  we estimate that our overall gross sales will be comprised of  food and  drinks  we anticipate achieving and maintaining a  food cost and  liquor cost which relates to our actual cost of the product compared to the gross revenue the product generates  for example if we sold a fish entree for  our actual cost would be  and our gross profit would be   prices for entrees will start at around  for a hamburger and rise to  for a prime rib steak dinner prices for drinks will start at  for beer  for basic well mixed drinks and  for specialty drinks  these price points are competitive with the existing restaurants our management team has scouted in the simpson bay area of st maarten dutch west indies where we intend to open our first blue water bar  grill that will cater to the tourist and local expatriot alike it is important to note that although we aspire to operate at or below the above food and liquor costs we cannot guarantee that we will ever achieve such food or liquor costs or if achieved will be able to maintain them operations and management our ability to effectively manage an operation including high volume restaurants annual gross sales of us or more with live entertainment offerings is critical to our overall success  in order to maintain quality and consistency at each of our future restaurants we must carefully train and properly supervise our personnel and the establishment of and adherence to high standards relating to personnel performance food and beverage preparation entertainment productions and equipment and maintenance of the restaurant facilities  we believe our current management is capable of overseeing our planned growth over the next two years  while staffing levels will vary from restaurant to restaurant depending on actual sales volumes we anticipate our typical restaurant management staff to be comprised of a general manager a kitchen manager who also serves as the head chef and a bar manager who also serves as the head bartender the kitchen manager and bar manager will also act as assistant general managers when the general manager is offduty and will receive a slightly higher base salary compared to our other chefs and bartenders to compensate for their added responsibilities recruiting   we will actively recruit and select individuals who share our passion for customer service  our selection process includes testing and multiple interviews to aid in the selection of new employees regardless of their prospective position  we will offer a competitive compensation plan to our managers that includes a base salary bonuses for achieving performance objectives and possibly incentive stock options once they have worked for us for at least one full year  for example the general manager in our initial blue water bar  grill restaurant will most likely be offered a base salary of  a month plus up to  a month in additional performance incentives for achieving minimum gross sales and exceeding the minimum targeted food liquor and labor costs as determined by our executive management team  in addition all employees are entitled to discount meals at any of our future restaurants training   we believe that proper training is the key to exceptional customer service  each new management hire will go through an extensive training program which will include crosstraining in all management duties  all nonmanagement new hires will go through a standard training program where they will learn and be tested on all of our food and drink offerings operational procedures and our pointofsale pos computer system management information systems mis   all of our future restaurants will be equipped with a variety of integrated management information systems  these systems will include an easytouse pointofsale pos computer system which facilitates the movement of customer food and drink orders between the customer areas and kitchen and bar operations controls cash handles credit card authorizations keeps track of sales on a per employee basis for incentive awards purposes and provides onsite and executive level management with realtime sales and inventory data  additionally we intend to implement a centralized accounting system that will include a food cost program and a labor scheduling and tracking program  physical inventories of food and drink items will be performed on a weekly basis  further daily weekly and  monthly financial information will be provided to executive level management for analysis and comparison to our budget and to comparable restaurants  by closely monitoring each restaurants gross sales cost of sales labor and other cost trends we will be better able to control our costs inventory levels and identify problems with individual operations if any early on secret shopper   because we believe exceptional customer service is paramount to our success we intend to implement a secret shopper program to monitor the quality control at all of our future restaurants  secret shoppers are independent persons who test the quality of our food drink and service as paying customers without the knowledge of the restaurants management or employees  secret shoppers then report their unbiased experiences to our executive level management longterm growth plan  years over the next five years we plan to focus on a disciplined growth strategy of opening one new blue water bar  grill restaurant each year  we have also identified the following caribbean islands we intend to eventually open a blue water bar  grill restaurant · st maarten dutch west indies · aruba dutch west indies · nassau bahamas · cozumel mexico · grand cayman and · barbados we estimate that we will need to raise approximately    million to open all of the above proposed restaurants  this capital will most likely be raised through the sales of additional equity securities which will have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders sales and marketing our marketing strategy is aimed at attracting new customers through both traditional and creative avenues  we intend to focus on building a reputation among local customers those living on the island while directing our marketing efforts toward tourists staying on the island or visiting for the day on a cruise ship  we intend to accomplish this through · grand opening promotions   · traditional paid advertising eg radio television newspaper etc · free media exposure eg hosting charity events food reviews etc and · working directly with tourism bureau representatives and transportation representatives taxi association bus association day sail and charter businesses etc when opening a new blue water bar  grill restaurant we intend to host grand opening parties for local leaders media personalities hospitality employees such as resort and hotel staff and tourism bureau representatives inclusive of cruise ship industry representatives and hotelresort industry representatives  our goal with courting these groups is to introduce them to our concept and court them to refer new customers to our restaurants and provide us with free future media exposure afterwards we will sustain awareness through more traditional marketing methods including radio and television spots newspaper ads billboards and road signs and resort and hotel concierge promotional cards and discount coupons if our strategy is successful it will lead to word of mouth referrals which is our ultimate goal  this is accomplished by providing our customers with consistently excellent service and quality food and drinks while we do not have a fixed marketing budget we do anticipate launching each new restaurant with a marketing blitz campaign and tapering it down to less than  of the restaurants annual gross sales once it is sufficiently established with regular and recurring revenue    financing we estimate that we will need to generate at least  million in additional financing in order to meet our planned  capital expenditures  further in order to proceed with our longterm plans we anticipate that we will need to generate at least between  and  million in additional longterm financing   without limiting our available options future financings will most likely be through the sale of additional shares of our common stock  it is possible that we could also offer warrants options andor rights in conjunction with any future issuances of our common stock  however we can give no assurance that financing will be available to us and if available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if we are unable to generate profits or unable to obtain additional funds to meet our working capital needs we may need to cease or curtail our business operations  further there is no assurance that the net proceeds from any successful financing arrangement will be sufficient to cover our projected expenditures over the next  months government regulation the restaurant industry is subject to many various laws which directly affect our organization and planned operations  each restaurant we open must comply with various licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities which typically include health safety and fire authorities in the municipality where our restaurant is located  the development and operation of a successful restaurant depends upon selecting and acquiring a suitable location which is normally subject to zoning land use environmental traffic and other regulations  further our operations will also be subject to various laws governing such matters as wages health insurance requirements working conditions citizenship and work permit requirements and mandatory overtime pay all of which will directly affect our labor costs additionally because we anticipate a significant portion of our revenue to be generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages we must comply with any and all regulations governing their sale  typically this requires the proper licensing at each restaurant location in many cases it needs to be renewed on an annual basis  such licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time  these regulations often relate to many aspects of the restaurant including the minimum age of patrons and employees hours of operation advertising wholesale purchasing inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages   the failure of any of our future restaurants to obtain and retain such a license would limit its ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability at that particular location which could subsequently impact our businesss overall revenues and ability to achieve and if achieved maintain profitability compliance with environmental laws we have not incurred and do not anticipate incurring any expenses associated with environmental laws patents and trademarks we are presently using the following trademarks and service marks blue water bar  grill and perfectly caribbean  we

investment  going concern consideration our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion in their audit report dated march   which can be found in our annual report on form k filed with the securities and exchange commission  sec  on march    this means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next  months off balance sheet operations as of june   we had no offbalance sheet activities or operations critical accounting policies use of estimates the accompanying financial statements of blue water have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is dependent upon future events the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates which have been made using careful judgment  actual results may vary from these estimates cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows blue water considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  as of june   and december   blue water had no cash equivalents fair value of financial instruments asc  fair value measurements and asc  financial instruments requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  it establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value  a financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement  it prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value level   description       level    applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level    applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets or modelderived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data level    applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities  the estimated fair values of the companys financial instruments as of june   are as follows   fair value measurement at june   using                   description      quoted prices in active markets for identical assets level    significant other

by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding for the period   diluted earnings per shares is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive  during the periods ended june   and december   blue water had no dilutive financial instruments issued or outstanding revenue recognition blue water recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured  determination of criteria  and  are based on managements judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees  income taxes blue water accounts for income taxes pursuant to fasb asc  income taxes  under fasb asc  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences   blue water maintains a valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets  blue water establishes a valuation allowance based upon the potential likelihood of realizing the deferred tax asset and taking into consideration blue waters financial position and results of operations for the current period  future realization of the deferred tax benefit depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period under the federal tax laws   changes in circumstances such as blue water generating taxable income could cause a change in judgment about its ability to realize the related deferred tax asset  any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the year of the change in estimate election to use extended transitional period under jumpstart our business startups act  jobs act  we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under section b of the jobs act that allows us to delay the  adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies  as a result of this election our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates recent accounting pronouncements there are various updates recently issued most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on blue waters financial position results of operations or cash flows contractual obligations as of june   blue water had no contractual obligations item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable since we are a smaller reporting company item   controls and procedures disclosure controls and procedures for the period covered by this report we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and sole director j scott sitra we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de of the exchange act a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be presented or detected on a timely basis based on managements assessment we have concluded that as of june   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in timely alerting management to the material information relating to us required to be included in our annual and interim filings with the sec management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures had the following material weaknesses · we were unable to maintain any segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance function  while this control deficiency has not resulted in any audit adjustments to our interim or annual financial statements it could have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties    · blue water lacks sufficient resources to perform the internal audit function and does not have an audit committee · we do not have an independent board of directors nor do we have a board member designated as an independent financial expert to blue water  the board of directors is comprised of one  member who also serves as blue waters principal executive officer  as a result there is a lack of independent oversight of the management team lack of independent review of our operating and financial results and lack of independent review of disclosures made by blue water and · documentation of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete these weaknesses have existed since our inception on june   and as of june   have not been remedied to the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned material weaknesses including but not limited to the following · considering the engagement of consultants to assist in ensuring that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures   · hiring additional qualified financial personnel including a chief financial officer on a fulltime basis · expanding our current board of directors to include additional independent individuals willing to perform directorial functions and · increasing our workforce in preparation for exiting the development stage and commencing revenue producing operations since the recited remedial actions will require that we hire or engage additional personnel these material weaknesses may not be overcome in the nearterm due to our limited financial resources  until such remedial actions can be realized we will continue to rely on the limited advice of outside professionals and consultants changes in controls and procedures there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting part ii item   legal proceedings during the past ten years no director person nominated to become a director or executive officer or promoter of blue water has been involved in any legal proceeding that would require disclosure hereunder from time to time we may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities  however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties for which the outcome cannot be predicted  any adverse result in these or other legal matters could arise and cause harm to our business  we currently are not party to any claim or litigation the outcome of which if determined adversely to us would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business item a  risk factors not applicable since we are a smaller
