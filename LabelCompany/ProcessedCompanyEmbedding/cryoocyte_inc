end date jan   grant year  project director webb j recipient organization cryoocyte inc  denby rd allstonma  performing department na non technical summary culturing fish today is organized around two key steps multiplication of fish in the hatcheries and the increase of fish biomass in growout production this transition is moreorless linear immediately after spawning eggs get fertilized develop and hatch they are grown to the fryfingerlingsmolt stage and get transferred to growout production this cycle starts with the spawning event which mostly is beyond the control of the hatchery managers and dictates when the cycle will end therefore there is limited control over breeding and reproductive operations at the hatchery this project is proposing a solution to this problem by developing a way to store eggs for extended periods of time in subzero temperatures the ability to store eggs for extended periods of time at subzero storage will i extend egg availability beyond spawning seasons and increase hatchery utilization ii enable synchronization of hatchery operations through ondemand access to eggs iii facilitate transport of eggs for long distances which is cheaper and safer than shipping frywe propose an investigation into commonly employed freezing solution additives to establish relationship between their concentration temperature and potential for extending subzero storage duration of salmon eggs out of the relationships guidelines for additive dosage and storage temperature will be established for direct application to existing subzero storage processes the ultimate

life of fish eggs and through this to increase the efficiency of producing food fish the specific objectives of this project are to i produce graphical ice fraction plots for  commonly employed freezing solution additives ii produce graphical ice nucleation plots for  commonly employed freezing solution additives iii produce graphical plots predicting optimum storage conditions for the  commonly employed freezing solution additives iv evaluate the top  additives and associated concentrationtemperature guidelines against existing subzero storage process in terms of duration project methods the project will be conducted based on the highthroughput research and development strategy facilitating the evaluation of new additives especially when concentration and temperature guidelines are not available the work plan encompasses four objectives with the results of the first two objectives combined in the third objective and applies towards direction of the fourth objective graphical plots will be identified under objectives  that will enable prediction of optimum storage conditions additive concentration and temperature for the  commonly employed freezing solution additives additives will be ranked based on their potential for advancing existing subzero storage processes under objective  at least one freezing solution additive will be identified that enables extended egg storage at subzero temperatures progress  to outputstarget audiencethe following target audiences were reached by the efforts of the project  usda aquaculture researchers

 presentation made to  college students interested in pursuing careers in science about performed workaquaculture industry and strategies to pursueresearchcareers in aquaculture what do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals nothing reported impactswhat was accomplished under these goals phase i was developed around four technical objectives the first two objectives developed new physical and functional information on a broad spectrum of potential storage medium additives that was then collated in objective  to select the most promising storage medium additives for testing against an existing subzero storage process in objective  objective  aimed to produce graphical ice fraction plots for  commonly employed freezing solution additives physical data generated as part of this objective enabled a myriad of multiple comparisons between different additives and additive classes while the data enabled comparative statements between solution additives its true utility became apparent when combined with additional data sets relating additives to functional measures obtained in objective  objective  aimed to produce graphical ice nucleation plots for  commonly employed freezing solution additives under this objective solutions with the most profound effects were identified and general trends were noted in relation to various classes of solutions under objective  combinatorial analysis detected regions of favorable intersection between plots from objective  and  finally under objective data was obtained on the most promising additives combining assessments from objective  and  further optimization strategies were identified forming the basis for parts of the proposed phase ii experimental plan publications progress  to

discussions were also held with businesses in the us and internationally about the benefits of technologies coming out of the project and best ways fortheir future commercialization a number of meetings and presentations have been held with stakeholders from communities of interest the objective of those efforts was to share the new possibilities in coldwater aquaculture industry arising from conducted research and solicit feedback on potential applications for specific customer groups user requirements for products currently under development by cryoocyte were also obtained and used to guide product development effort a workshop about the use of egg storage was held for usda cold water aquaculture research center staff outreach has been done to the salmon hatcheries in the usand feedback was obtained about the potential benefits of egg storage meetings were held with several norwegian aquaculture companies including salmon multiplication hatcheries vaccine producers working

accomplished under these goals as of projects midpoint the work around all of the four objectives of the proposal has been commenced and is in different stages of completion the graphical ice fraction plots for commonly employed freezing additives have been produced and assessment has proceeded at two resolutions after initial screening of singular additives greater applicability was desired from the results of singular additive analysis studies regarding internal ice nucleation in salmonid eggs have progressed through a preliminary screening in our first generation planer cryogenic
