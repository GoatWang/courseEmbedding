powerpack battery systems heralds the dawn of electricity superstorage  this means big shipping container and factory sized batteries that give us clean and cheap energy exactly where and when we need it why do we need to store our electricity like this  the government has begun its long term commitment to turn off the uk’s coal and oil fired power stations and generate more and more electricity from renewable sources like solar and wind as they do this we need to find new ways to be able to access this clean electricity at any time whatever the weather  our national grid wasn’t designed to cope with the fluctuations of the wind and sun nor the variations in electricity use that our lifestyles demand of the grid we need electricity superstorage that will capture the surplus energy produced in optimal weather conditions and at “offpeak” times delivering it back to us when we need it most at cumulus energy storage we have been planning for this opportunity since   we have designed new electricity superstorage that can be simply deployed alongside renewables sites as well as at the heart of cities being easily integrated into industrial centres and processes and be a vital part of a grid infrastructure renewal programme  to achieve this we have ruthlessly focused on three things  creating a scalable solution that can be used around the world  our uk team is leading a cleantech revolution in the industrial heartland of sheffield and our san francisco rd team resides in the global epicentre of energy storage innovation investment and deployment we know what our customer needs are from coping with brownouts to securing offgrid generation and we have developed a storage as a service business model so there is no big upfront cost for installation  developing a battery technology that delivers megawatt capacity at the cheapest price  our gridlevel batteries will store a market leading capacity of up to mwh with the lowest lcoe globally at £ per kwh we can provide an economical energy storage solution matched only by electricity from pumped hydro and no other energy source can be implemented as close to where it’s actually needed delivering maximum reliability  our patented innovation is based on using a proven chemical process that has existed for  years in a novel way we have taken the materials alessandro volta used in his voltaic pile and developed it further to make it rechargeable this approach of using copper and zinc the th and th most abundant materials on earth means our batteries can be rolled out rapidly and at scale the ability to maintain our batteries whilst in operation gives them the important advantage of a year lifetime comparable to the lifetime of the rest of the assets in the electricity supply chain the market drivers are picking up pace legislation innovation and above all demand from commercial and industrial customers are driving the rapid adoption and implementation the dawn of electricity

to vote for this solution voting will start on voting ended on published  jan  post comment share this solution copperzinc  delivering renewable electricity globally the world is generating more renewable electricity these days when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing the problem is that the grid doesn’t always have the capacity to cope with this variable and intermittent renewable generation what we need is lowcost largescale energy storage to capture the surplus energy produced by renewables at offpeak times and deliver it back at times of peak demand this is what cumulus energy storage does we’re developing lowcost electricity superstorage batteries that make renewables work using  year old copperzinc battery technology invented by volta we’ve inserted a membrane between the copper and zinc electrodes to make the battery rechargeable and suitable for the stationary energy storage market applications ranging from timeshifting commercial renewables generation to more efficient transmission and distribution networks plus improved energy management of electricity intensive industries key benefits include a levelised cost of energy lcoe the same or lower than that of pumped hydro which is  of the global energy storage market today delivering renewable electricity at the time it is needed by charging over  hours and discharging over the same timeframe  recyclability room temperature operation  year asset life due to maintainability and  round trip efficiency acac in short a battery designed for the high energy long duration market  the missing link for renewables how it benefits society in  national grid paid uk wind farm operators £m to not generate electricity as part of the overall need to balance electricity generation with demand the need to curtail wind farms because the grid couldn’t cope with the electricity generated by wind turbines cost china in excess of bn in  and the california independent system operator caiso ‘duck curve’ graphically represents the difficulty caused for the electricity network by distributed solar pv generation in california this need to balance and timeshift electricity generated by renewables is a global problem that electricity energy storage by cumulus is ideally suited to solve in the uk  reports from carbon trust and national infrastructure commission forecast the following savings the national infrastructure commission’s central finding is that smart power – principally built around three innovations interconnection storage and demand flexibility – could save consumers up to £ billion a year by  help the uk meet its  carbon targets and secure the uk’s energy supply for generations the carbon trust report identified energy storage could save £ billion a year system wide also by  and if regulatory hurdles are overcome this could rise to £ billion a year cumulus together with a range of complementary energy storage interconnector and demand side response installations is poised to deliver these savings for the uk whats unique about it cumulus customers are commercial renewables generators especially mw wind and solar electricity intensive industries eg steel cement mining and when policy is sorted out the electricity infrastructure including transmission distribution rail and electric vehicle charging networks cumulus has a series of value propositions that support  renewable energy through asset deferral arbitrage and ancillary services essentially enabling more renewable electricity to be delivered to customers at the right time without the need for expensive network investment payback periods are typically  years which are lower than lithium ion battery solutions the levelised cost of energy lcoe will be the same or lower than pumped hydro and a lot less than other battery technologies cumulus success will be measured in mwh and then gwh of energy delivered from our copperzinc batteries globally through our innovative storage as a service saas business model cumulus is the only company globally to be able to make and sell rechargeable copperzinc batteries because of our patent granted technology to date cumulus has raised £m including £k grant from the uk government opportunity to scale cumulus has  preorders for mwmwh with a combined value of £m for delivery in  cumulus is currently raising £m equity for a mwhmonth pilot line and will need £m equity for full production in sheffield of mwhgwhyear the saas fund is likely to need £m£m to service the working capital required for   and  year power purchase agreements modelling for this is under way and we have investors lining up for this fund product warranties for the   and  year power purchase agreements are a current constraint we will require contract manufacturing and licensing deals to scale up quickly enough for the global market opportunity which is already being measured in gwh of energy storage in each of australia europe india and china automation of the manufacturing facility combined with a very simple cell architecture and low cost supply chain will be critical for scaleup which is why we’ve designed our cells in the way we have more storage simply means more cells which drives cost down the experience curve in the uk our team of  including ceo is completing the manufacturing design for the pilot line scheduled to go into a  sqft facility at the advanced manufacturing park near sheffield in the second half of  our productionintent prototype is on track for pilot line production later in  which will enable early adopter customer feedback and
