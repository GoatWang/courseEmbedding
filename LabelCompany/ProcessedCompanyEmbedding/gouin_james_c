by former chrysler llc parent cerberus capital management lp the securities and exchange commission is welcome anytime thats because cfo james gouin rebuilt towers entire financial system after joining the company in november  following the companys emergence from chapter  bankruptcy the previous july “it was a huge change” gouin said “when i came here i would say that the control environment was virtually nonexistent — everything from policies and procedures or even what is internal control “ the company which posts about  billion in annual revenue is now sarbanesoxleycompliant produces full reports required by the sec such as forms q k and k has the oversight of disclosure and enterprise riskmanagement committees and a complete internal control and quality oversight system — in roughly a single year thats not as easy as flipping a switch some consider secstyle reporting and control to be onerous expensive practices “but  the governance it drives and the control it drives down deep into business is really the way you should run the business” he said the uncertainties about the longterm future prospects that come along with privateequity ownership also make the controls worthwhile “since we dont know what the ultimate exit is from cerberus — who knows it could be a public offering it could be a consolidation or a rollup but either way well be ready” he said gouin  knows the demands and benefits of publiccompany reporting requirements from the ground up he got his first job with ford motor co as an accounts payable clerk at fords essex engine plant when he was  he worked his way up the ranks of fords financial hierarchy with stints in marketing and sales manufacturing product development and other areas until he was cfo of fords north american operations and vice president and corporate controller for fords global operations he left ford in march  to establish the detroit office of fti consulting as a senior managing director at the firm then the opportunity to join tower came along “to come into a company thats much smaller where you can really really have an influence is what i saw here at tower and i saw a tremendous opportunity for value creation longerterm” — ryan beene related linksann becklaurie van peltdave morlockroger creggshankar kirumike twarozynskikaren belansmatthew simoncinidaniel
