rate loans and here’s what our math excludes and why savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than  why this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher for any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than  years we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than  years to pay off infull why  years is the maximum term allowed for a federal student loan or the cap on any federal student loan under income based repayment savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time why this is intended to filter out any cases
