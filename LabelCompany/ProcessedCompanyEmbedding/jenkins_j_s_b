that it could not provide an adequate account of the structural nature of language as articulated by noam chomsky he continued research on language and cognition eventually focusing on topics concerning speech perception in collaboration with his wife winifred strange his research was marked by an interest in new and even radical ideas eg those advocated by james j gibson a keen appreciation of the value of studying realworld problems as in his early research on aphasia and a willingness to give up cherished theories when the facts drove him to do so if youre not making any
