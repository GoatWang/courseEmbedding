in situ refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition in other words it is stationary meaning still an artifact being in situ is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and consequently of the culture which formed it once an artifacts findsite has been recorded the artifact can then be moved for conservation further interpretation and display an artifact that is not discovered in situ is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture however the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of in situ artifacts yet to be discovered when excavating a burial site or surface deposit in situ refers to cataloging recording mapping photographing human remains in the position they are discovered the label in situ indicates only that the object has not been newly moved thus an archaeological in situ find may be an object that was historically looted from another place an item of booty of a past war a traded item or otherwise of foreign origin consequently the in situ find site may still not reveal its provenance but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown it is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident by humans natural forces or animals for example in a tell mound where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal or in land cleared or tilled for farming the term in situ is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the sphinx or petra this distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the colossi of memnon which was moved in ancient times artedit in art in situ refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited for a more detailed account see sitespecific art the term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed rather than one created in the artists studio and then installed elsewhere eg a sculpture carved in situ in architectural sculpture the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building frequently from scaffolds after the building has been erected astronomyedit a fraction of the globular star clusters in our galaxy as well as those in other massive galaxies might have formed in situ the rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies in astronomy in situ also refers to in situ planet formation in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit biology and biomedical engineeringedit live sea snail species nataea photographed in situ in biology and biomedical engineering in situ means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs ie without moving it to some special medium in the case of observations or photographs of living animals it means that the organism was observed and photographed in the wild exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found this means it was not taken out of the area the organism had not been moved to another perhaps more convenient location such as an aquarium this phrase in situ when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between in vivo and in vitro for example examining a cell within a whole organ intact and under perfusion may be in situ investigation this would not be in vivo as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone a common scenario for in vitro experiments in vitro was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab eventually the limitation of in vitro experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments to compensate for this problem in vivo experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment to bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies in situ experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of in vitro to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of in vivo experimentation in conservation of genetic resources in situ conservation also onsite conservation is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat as opposed to ex situ conservation also offsite conservation chemistry and chemical engineeringedit in chemistry in situ typically means in the reaction mixture there are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized in situ in various processes this may be done because the species is unstable and cannot be isolated or simply out of convenience examples of the former include the coreychaykovsky reagent and adrenochrome in biomedical engineering protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases in chemical engineering in situ often refers to industrial plant operations or procedures that are performed in place for example aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place in situ without being removed from the reactors civil engineeringedit in architecture and building in situ refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials compare that with prefabricated construction in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly for example concrete slabs may be in situ also castinplace or prefabricated in situ techniques are often more labourintensive and take longer but the materials are cheaper and the work is versatile and adaptable prefabricated techniques are usually much quicker therefore saving money on labour costs but factorymade parts can be expensive they are also inflexible and must often be designed on a grid with all details fully calculated in advance finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions the phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site in this case it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is cut out of one area and filled in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope the term in situ distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified filled during construction the differences in the soil properties for supporting foundations accepting underground utilities and shedding storm water persist indefinitely computer scienceedit in computer science an in situ operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a systemcitation needed for example a file backup may be restored over a running system without needing to take the system down to perform the restore in the context of a database a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened an in situ upgrade would allow an operating system firmware or application to be upgraded while the system was still running perhaps without the need to reboot it depending on the sophistication of the system an algorithm is said to be an in situ algorithm or inplace algorithm if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is ocitation needed that is does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input for example heapsort is an in situ sorting algorithm in designing user interfaces the term in situ means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another windowcitation needed for example if a word processor displays an image and allows you to edit the image without launching a separate image editor this is called in situ editing in big data space in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located rather than the other waycitation needed like in traditional rdbms systems where data is moved to computational space design and advertisingedit in design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations this is a previsualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept earth and atmospheric sciencesedit in physical geography and the earth sciences in situ typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport for example in situ is used in relation to the distinction between weathering and erosion the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium such as wind ice or water whereas weathering occurs in situ geochemical processes are also often described as occurring to material in situ in the atmospheric sciences in situ refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject such as a radiosonde measuring a parcel of air or an anemometer measuring wind as opposed to remote sensing such as weather radar or satellites economicsedit in economics in situ is used when referring to the in place storage of a product usually a natural resource more generally it refers to any situation where there is no outofpocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold examples of in situ storage would be oil and gas wells all types of mineral and gem mines stone quarries timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay electrochemistryedit in electrochemistry the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell ie under potential control this is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrodeelectrolyte interphasial region environmental remediationedit in situ can refer to where a clean up or remediation of a polluted site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the soil contrary to ex situ where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere off site experimental physicsedit in experimental physics in situ typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment for example the si x surface reconstruction is visible using a scanning tunneling microscope when it is prepared and analyzed in situ experimental psychologyedit in psychology experiments in situ typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting gastronomyedit in gastronomy in situ refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available on the site of the event here you are not going to the restaurant but the restaurant comes to your home lawedit in legal contexts in situ is often used for its literal meaning for example in hong kong in situ land exchange involves the government exchanging the original or expired lease of a piece of land with a new grant or regrant with the same piece of land or a portion of that in the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term in situ is used to distinguish between an exiled government and a government with effective control over the territory ie the government in situ linguisticsedit in linguistics specifically syntax an element may be said to be in situ if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted for example questions in languages such as chinese have in situ whelements with structures comparable to john bought what with what in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart for example john bought bread an example of an english whelement that is not in situ see whmovement what did john buy literatureedit in literature in situ is used to describe a condition the rosetta stone for example was originally erected in a courtyard for public viewing most pictures of the famous stone are not in situ pictures of it erected as it would have been originally the stone was uncovered as part of building material within a wall its in situ condition today is that it is erected vertically on public display at the british museum in london england medicineedit in addition to benign tumors there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors in situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane diagram of an in situ carcinoma in oncology for a carcinoma in situ means that malignant cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized or invaded beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered this can happen anywhere in the body such as the skin breast tissue or lung this type of tumor can often depending on where it is located be removed by surgery in anatomy in situ refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies for example one can open up a cadavers abdominal cavity and view the liver in situ or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadavers body in nursing in situ describes any devices or appliances on the patients body that remain in their desired and optimal position in medical simulation in situ refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments such as wards operating rooms and other settings rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities in biomedical protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases miningedit in situ leaching or in situ recovery refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uraniumimpregnated water to the surface for extraction petroleum productionedit in situ refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to heavy crude oil or bitumen reservoirs beneath the earths crust there are several varieties of in situ techniques but the ones which work best in the oil sands use heat steam the most common type of in situ petroleum production is referred to as sagd steamassisted gravity drainage this is becoming very popular in the alberta oil sands rf transmissionedit in radio frequency rf transmission systems in situ is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is in its standard transmission mode rather than operation in a test mode for example if an in situ wattmeter is used in a commercial broadcast transmission system the wattmeter can accurately measure power while the station is on air spacerelatededit future space exploration or terraforming may rely on obtaining supplies in situ such as previous plans to power the orion space vehicle with fuel minable on the moon the mars direct mission concept is based primarily on the in situ fuel production using sabatier reaction in the space sciences in situ refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in such as the detection of energetic particles in the solar wind or magnetic field measurements from a magnetometer urban planningedit in urban planning insitu upgrading is an approach to and method of upgrading informal settlements vacuum technologyedit in vacuum technology in situ baking refers to heating parts of the vacuum system while they are under vacuum in order to drive off volatile substances that may be absorbed or adsorbed on the walls so they cannot cause

industry equipment onboard aircraft must be tested in situ or in place to confirm everything functions properly as a system individually each piece may work but interference from nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems special test equipment is available for this in situ testing archaeologyedit ancient hohokam arrowhead in situ in archaeology in situ refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition in other words it is stationary meaning still an artifact being in situ is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and consequently of the culture which formed it once an artifacts findsite has been recorded the artifact can then be moved for conservation further interpretation and display an artifact that is not discovered in situ is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture however the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of in situ artifacts yet to be discovered when excavating a burial site or surface deposit in situ refers to cataloging recording mapping photographing human remains in the position they are discovered the label in situ indicates only that the object has not been newly moved thus an archaeological in situ find may be an object that was historically looted from another place an item of booty of a past war a traded item or otherwise of foreign origin consequently the in situ find site may still not reveal its provenance but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown it is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident by humans natural forces or animals for example in a tell mound where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal or in land cleared or tilled for farming the term in situ is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the sphinx or petra this distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the colossi of memnon which was moved in ancient times artedit in art in situ refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited for a more detailed account see sitespecific art the term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed rather than one created in the artists studio and then installed elsewhere eg a sculpture carved in situ in architectural sculpture the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building frequently from scaffolds after the building has been erected astronomyedit a fraction of the globular star clusters in our galaxy as well as those in other massive galaxies might have formed in situ the rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies in astronomy in situ also refers to in situ planet formation in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit biology and biomedical engineeringedit live sea snail species nataea photographed in situ in biology and biomedical engineering in situ means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs ie without moving it to some special medium in the case of observations or photographs of living animals it means that the organism was observed and photographed in the wild exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found this means it was not taken out of the area the organism had not been moved to another perhaps more convenient location such as an aquarium this phrase in situ when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between in vivo and in vitro for example examining a cell within a whole organ intact and under perfusion may be in situ investigation this would not be in vivo as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone a common scenario for in vitro experiments in vitro was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab eventually the limitation of in vitro experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments to compensate for this problem in vivo experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment to bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies in situ experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of in vitro to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of in vivo experimentation in conservation of genetic resources in situ conservation also onsite conservation is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat as opposed to ex situ conservation also offsite conservation chemistry and chemical engineeringedit in chemistry in situ typically means in the reaction mixture there are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized in situ in various processes this may be done because the species is unstable and cannot be isolated or simply out of convenience examples of the former include the coreychaykovsky reagent and adrenochrome in biomedical engineering protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases in chemical engineering in situ often refers to industrial plant operations or procedures that are performed in place for example aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place in situ without being removed from the reactors civil engineeringedit in architecture and building in situ refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials compare that with prefabricated construction in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly for example concrete slabs may be in situ also castinplace or prefabricated in situ techniques are often more labourintensive and take longer but the materials are cheaper and the work is versatile and adaptable prefabricated techniques are usually much quicker therefore saving money on labour costs but factorymade parts can be expensive they are also inflexible and must often be designed on a grid with all details fully calculated in advance finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions the phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site in this case it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is cut out of one area and filled in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope the term in situ distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified filled during construction the differences in the soil properties for supporting foundations accepting underground utilities and shedding storm water persist indefinitely computer scienceedit in computer science an in situ operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a systemcitation needed for example a file backup may be restored over a running system without needing to take the system down to perform the restore in the context of a database a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened an in situ upgrade would allow an operating system firmware or application to be upgraded while the system was still running perhaps without the need to reboot it depending on the sophistication of the system an algorithm is said to be an in situ algorithm or inplace algorithm if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is ocitation needed that is does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input for example heapsort is an in situ sorting algorithm in designing user interfaces the term in situ means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another windowcitation needed for example if a word processor displays an image and allows you to edit the image without launching a separate image editor this is called in situ editing in big data space in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located rather than the other waycitation needed like in traditional rdbms systems where data is moved to computational space design and advertisingedit in design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations this is a previsualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept earth and atmospheric sciencesedit in physical geography and the earth sciences in situ typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport for example in situ is used in relation to the distinction between weathering and erosion the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium such as wind ice or water whereas weathering occurs in situ geochemical processes are also often described as occurring to material in situ in the atmospheric sciences in situ refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject such as a radiosonde measuring a parcel of air or an anemometer measuring wind as opposed to remote sensing such as weather radar or satellites economicsedit in economics in situ is used when referring to the in place storage of a product usually a natural resource more generally it refers to any situation where there is no outofpocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold examples of in situ storage would be oil and gas wells all types of mineral and gem mines stone quarries timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay electrochemistryedit in electrochemistry the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell ie under potential control this is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrodeelectrolyte interphasial region environmental remediationedit in situ can refer to where a clean up or remediation of a polluted site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the soil contrary to ex situ where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere off site experimental physicsedit in experimental physics in situ typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment for example the si x surface reconstruction is visible using a scanning tunneling microscope when it is prepared and analyzed in situ experimental psychologyedit in psychology experiments in situ typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting gastronomyedit in gastronomy in situ refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available on the site of the event here you are not going to the restaurant but the restaurant comes to your home lawedit in legal contexts in situ is often used for its literal meaning for example in hong kong in situ land exchange involves the government exchanging the original or expired lease of a piece of land with a new grant or regrant with the same piece of land or a portion of that in the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term in situ is used to distinguish between an exiled government and a government with effective control over the territory ie the government in situ linguisticsedit in linguistics specifically syntax an element may be said to be in situ if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted for example questions in languages such as chinese have in situ whelements with structures comparable to john bought what with what in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart for example john bought bread an example of an english whelement that is not in situ see whmovement what did john buy literatureedit in literature in situ is used to describe a condition the rosetta stone for example was originally erected in a courtyard for public viewing most pictures of the famous stone are not in situ pictures of it erected as it would have been originally the stone was uncovered as part of building material within a wall its in situ condition today is that it is erected vertically on public display at the british museum in london england medicineedit in addition to benign tumors there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors in situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane diagram of an in situ carcinoma in oncology for a carcinoma in situ means that malignant cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized or invaded beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered this can happen anywhere in the body such as the skin breast tissue or lung this type of tumor can often depending on where it is located be removed by surgery in anatomy in situ refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies for example one can open up a cadavers abdominal cavity and view the liver in situ or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadavers body in nursing in situ describes any devices or appliances on the patients body that remain in their desired and optimal position in medical simulation in situ refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments such as wards operating rooms and other settings rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities in biomedical protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases miningedit in situ leaching or in situ recovery refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uraniumimpregnated water to the surface for extraction petroleum productionedit in situ refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to heavy crude oil or bitumen reservoirs beneath the earths crust there are several varieties of in situ techniques but the ones which work best in the oil sands use heat steam the most common type of in situ petroleum production is referred to as sagd steamassisted gravity drainage this is becoming very popular in the alberta oil sands rf transmissionedit in radio frequency rf transmission systems in situ is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is

been moved from its original place of deposition in other words it is stationary meaning still an artifact being in situ is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and consequently of the culture which formed it once an artifacts findsite has been recorded the artifact can then be moved for conservation further interpretation and display an artifact that is not discovered in situ is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture however the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of in situ artifacts yet to be discovered when excavating a burial site or surface deposit in situ refers to cataloging recording mapping photographing human remains in the position they are discovered the label in situ indicates only that the object has not been newly moved thus an archaeological in situ find may be an object that was historically looted from another place an item of booty of a past war a traded item or otherwise of foreign origin consequently the in situ find site may still not reveal its provenance but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown it is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident by humans natural forces or animals for example in a tell mound where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal or in land cleared or tilled for farming the term in situ is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the sphinx or petra this distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the colossi of memnon which was moved in ancient times artedit in art in situ refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited for a more detailed account see sitespecific art the term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed rather than one created in the artists studio and then installed elsewhere eg a sculpture carved in situ in architectural sculpture the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building frequently from scaffolds after the building has been erected astronomyedit a fraction of the globular star clusters in our galaxy as well as those in other massive galaxies might have formed in situ the rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies in astronomy in situ also refers to in situ planet formation in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit biology and biomedical engineeringedit live sea snail species nataea photographed in situ in biology and biomedical engineering in situ means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs ie without moving it to some special medium in the case of observations or photographs of living animals it means that the organism was observed and photographed in the wild exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found this means it was not taken out of the area the organism had not been moved to another perhaps more convenient location such as an aquarium this phrase in situ when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between in vivo and in vitro for example examining a cell within a whole organ intact and under perfusion may be in situ investigation this would not be in vivo as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone a common scenario for in vitro experiments in vitro was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab eventually the limitation of in vitro experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments to compensate for this problem in vivo experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment to bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies in situ experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of in vitro to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of in vivo experimentation in conservation of genetic resources in situ conservation also onsite conservation is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat as opposed to ex situ conservation also offsite conservation chemistry and chemical engineeringedit in chemistry in situ typically means in the reaction mixture there are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized in situ in various processes this may be done because the species is unstable and cannot be isolated or simply out of convenience examples of the former include the coreychaykovsky reagent and adrenochrome in biomedical engineering protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases in chemical engineering in situ often refers to industrial plant operations or procedures that are performed in place for example aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place in situ without being removed from the reactors civil engineeringedit in architecture and building in situ refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials compare that with prefabricated construction in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly for example concrete slabs may be in situ also castinplace or prefabricated in situ techniques are often more labourintensive and take longer but the materials are cheaper and the work is versatile and adaptable prefabricated techniques are usually much quicker therefore saving money on labour costs but factorymade parts can be expensive they are also inflexible and must often be designed on a grid with all details fully calculated in advance finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions the phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site in this case it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is cut out of one area and filled in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope the term in situ distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified filled during construction the differences in the soil properties for supporting foundations accepting underground utilities and shedding storm water persist indefinitely computer scienceedit in computer science an in situ operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a systemcitation needed for example a file backup may be restored over a running system without needing to take the system down to perform the restore in the context of a database a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened an in situ upgrade would allow an operating system firmware or application to be upgraded while the system was still running perhaps without the need to reboot it depending on the sophistication of the system an algorithm is said to be an in situ algorithm or inplace algorithm if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is ocitation needed that is does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input for example heapsort is an in situ sorting algorithm in designing user interfaces the term in situ means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another windowcitation needed for example if a word processor displays an image and allows you to edit the image without launching a separate image editor this is called in situ editing in big data space in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located rather than the other waycitation needed like in traditional rdbms systems where data is moved to computational space design and advertisingedit in design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations this is a previsualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept earth and atmospheric sciencesedit in physical geography and the earth sciences in situ typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport for example in situ is used in relation to the distinction between weathering and erosion the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium such as wind ice or water whereas weathering occurs in situ geochemical processes are also often described as occurring to material in situ in the atmospheric sciences in situ refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject such as a radiosonde measuring a parcel of air or an anemometer measuring wind as opposed to remote sensing such as weather radar or satellites economicsedit in economics in situ is used when referring to the in place storage of a product usually a natural resource more generally it refers to any situation where there is no outofpocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold examples of in situ storage would be oil and gas wells all types of mineral and gem mines stone quarries timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay electrochemistryedit in electrochemistry the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell ie under potential control this is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrodeelectrolyte interphasial region environmental remediationedit in situ can refer to where a clean up or remediation of a polluted site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the soil contrary to ex situ where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere off site experimental physicsedit in experimental physics in situ typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment for example the si x surface reconstruction is visible using a scanning tunneling microscope when it is prepared and analyzed in situ experimental psychologyedit in psychology experiments in situ typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting gastronomyedit in gastronomy in situ refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available on the site of the event here you are not going to the restaurant but the restaurant comes to your home lawedit in legal contexts in situ is often used for its literal meaning for example in hong kong in situ land exchange involves the government exchanging the original or expired lease of a piece of land with a new grant or regrant with the same piece of land or a portion of that in the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term in situ is used to distinguish between an exiled government and a government with effective control over the territory ie the government in situ linguisticsedit in linguistics specifically syntax an element may be said to be in situ if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted for example questions in languages such as chinese have in situ whelements with structures comparable to john bought what with what in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart for example john bought bread an example of an english whelement that is not in situ see whmovement what did john buy literatureedit in literature in situ is used to describe a condition the rosetta stone for example was originally erected in a courtyard for public viewing most pictures of the famous stone are not in situ pictures of it erected as it would have been originally the stone was uncovered as part of building material within a wall its in situ condition today is that it is erected vertically on public display at the british museum in london england medicineedit in addition to benign tumors there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors in situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane diagram of an in situ carcinoma in oncology for a carcinoma in situ means that malignant cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized or invaded beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered this can happen anywhere in the body such as the skin breast tissue or lung this type of tumor can often depending on where it is located be removed by surgery in anatomy in situ refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies for example one can open up a cadavers abdominal cavity and view the liver in situ or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadavers body in nursing in situ describes any devices or appliances on the patients body that remain in their desired and optimal position in medical simulation in situ refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments such as wards operating rooms and other settings rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities in biomedical protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a

for extraction petroleum productionedit in situ refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to heavy crude oil or bitumen reservoirs beneath the earths crust there are several varieties of in situ techniques but the ones which work best in the oil sands use heat steam the most common type of in situ petroleum production is referred to as sagd steamassisted gravity drainage this is becoming very popular in the alberta oil sands rf transmissionedit in radio frequency rf transmission systems in situ is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is

often not italicized in english is a latin phrase that translates literally to on site or in position it means locally on site on the premises or in place to describe an event where it takes place and is used in many different contexts for example in fields such as physics chemistry or biology in situ may describe the way a measurement is taken that is in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test contents  aerospace  archaeology  art  astronomy  biology and biomedical engineering  chemistry and chemical engineering  civil engineering  computer science  design and advertising  earth and atmospheric sciences  economics  electrochemistry  environmental remediation  experimental physics  experimental psychology  gastronomy  law  linguistics  literature  medicine  mining  petroleum production  rf transmission  spacerelated  urban planning  vacuum technology  road assistance  see also  references aerospaceedit in the aerospace industry equipment onboard aircraft must be tested in situ or in place to confirm everything functions properly as a system individually each piece may work but interference from nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems special test equipment is available for this in situ testing archaeologyedit ancient hohokam arrowhead in situ in archaeology in situ refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition in other words it is stationary meaning still an artifact being in situ is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and consequently of the culture which formed it once an artifacts findsite has been recorded the artifact can then be moved for conservation further interpretation and display an artifact that is not discovered in situ is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture however the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of in situ artifacts yet to be discovered when excavating a burial site or surface deposit in situ refers to cataloging recording mapping photographing human remains in the position they are discovered the label in situ indicates only that the object has not been newly moved thus an archaeological in situ find may be an object that was historically looted from another place an item of booty of a past war a traded item or otherwise of foreign origin consequently the in situ find site may still not reveal its provenance but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown it is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident by humans natural forces or animals for example in a tell mound where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal or in land cleared or tilled for farming the term in situ is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the sphinx or petra this distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the colossi of memnon which was moved in ancient times artedit in art in situ refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited for a more detailed account see sitespecific art the term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed rather than one created in the artists studio and then installed elsewhere eg a sculpture carved in situ in architectural sculpture the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building frequently from scaffolds after the building has been erected astronomyedit a fraction of the globular star clusters in our galaxy as well as those in other massive galaxies might have formed in situ the rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies in astronomy in situ also refers to in situ planet formation in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit biology and biomedical engineeringedit live sea snail species nataea photographed in situ in biology and biomedical engineering in situ means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs ie without moving it to some special medium in the case of observations or photographs of living animals it means that the organism was observed and photographed in the wild exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found this means it was not taken out of the area the organism had not been moved to another perhaps more convenient location such as an aquarium this phrase in situ when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between in vivo and in vitro for example examining a cell within a whole organ intact and under perfusion may be in situ investigation this would not be in vivo as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone a common scenario for in vitro experiments in vitro was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab eventually the limitation of in vitro experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments to compensate for this problem in vivo experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment to bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies in situ experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of in vitro to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of in vivo experimentation in conservation of genetic resources in situ conservation also onsite conservation is the process of protecting an endangered plant or animal species in its natural habitat as opposed to ex situ conservation also offsite conservation chemistry and chemical engineeringedit in chemistry in situ typically means in the reaction mixture there are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized in situ in various processes this may be done because the species is unstable and cannot be isolated or simply out of convenience examples of the former include the coreychaykovsky reagent and adrenochrome in biomedical engineering protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases in chemical engineering in situ often refers to industrial plant operations or procedures that are performed in place for example aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place in situ without being removed from the reactors civil engineeringedit in architecture and building in situ refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials compare that with prefabricated construction in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly for example concrete slabs may be in situ also castinplace or prefabricated in situ techniques are often more labourintensive and take longer but the materials are cheaper and the work is versatile and adaptable prefabricated techniques are usually much quicker therefore saving money on labour costs but factorymade parts can be expensive they are also inflexible and must often be designed on a grid with all details fully calculated in advance finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions the phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site in this case it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is cut out of one area and filled in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope the term in situ distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified filled during construction the differences in the soil properties for supporting foundations accepting underground utilities and shedding storm water persist indefinitely computer scienceedit in computer science an in situ operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a systemcitation needed for example a file backup may be restored over a running system without needing to take the system down to perform the restore in the context of a database a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened an in situ upgrade would allow an operating system firmware or application to be upgraded while the system was still running perhaps without the need to reboot it depending on the sophistication of the system an algorithm is said to be an in situ algorithm or inplace algorithm if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is ocitation needed that is does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input for example heapsort is an in situ sorting algorithm in designing user interfaces the term in situ means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another windowcitation needed for example if a word processor displays an image and allows you to edit the image without launching a separate image editor this is called in situ editing in big data space in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located rather than the other waycitation needed like in traditional rdbms systems where data is moved to computational space design and advertisingedit in design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations this is a previsualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept earth and atmospheric sciencesedit in physical geography and the earth sciences in situ typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport for example in situ is used in relation to the distinction between weathering and erosion the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium such as wind ice or water whereas weathering occurs in situ geochemical processes are also often described as occurring to material in situ in the atmospheric sciences in situ refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject such as a radiosonde measuring a parcel of air or an anemometer measuring wind as opposed to remote sensing such as weather radar or satellites economicsedit in economics in situ is used when referring to the in place storage of a product usually a natural resource more generally it refers to any situation where there is no outofpocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold examples of in situ storage would be oil and gas wells all types of mineral and gem mines stone quarries timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay electrochemistryedit in electrochemistry the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell ie under potential control this is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrodeelectrolyte interphasial region environmental remediationedit in situ can refer to where a clean up or remediation of a polluted site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the soil contrary to ex situ where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere off site experimental physicsedit in experimental physics in situ typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment for example the si x surface reconstruction is visible using a scanning tunneling microscope when it is prepared and analyzed in situ experimental psychologyedit in psychology experiments in situ typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting gastronomyedit in gastronomy in situ refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available on the site of the event here you are not going to the restaurant but the restaurant comes to your home lawedit in legal contexts in situ is often used for its literal meaning for example in hong kong in situ land exchange involves the government exchanging the original or expired lease of a piece of land with a new grant or regrant with the same piece of land or a portion of that in the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term in situ is used to distinguish between an exiled government and a government with effective control over the territory ie the government in situ linguisticsedit in linguistics specifically syntax an element may be said to be in situ if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted for example questions in languages such as chinese have in situ whelements with structures comparable to john bought what with what in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart for example john bought bread an example of an english whelement that is not in situ see whmovement what did john buy literatureedit in literature in situ is used to describe a condition the rosetta stone for example was originally erected in a courtyard for public viewing most pictures of the famous stone are not in situ pictures of it erected as it would have been originally the stone was uncovered as part of building material within a wall its in situ condition today is that it is erected vertically on public display at the british museum in london england medicineedit in addition to benign tumors there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors in situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane diagram of an in situ carcinoma in oncology for a carcinoma in situ means that malignant cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized or invaded beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered this can happen anywhere in the body such as the skin breast tissue or lung this type of tumor can often depending on where it is located be removed by surgery in anatomy in situ refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies for example one can open up a cadavers abdominal cavity and view the liver in situ or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadavers body in nursing in situ describes any devices or appliances on the patients body that remain in their desired and optimal position in medical simulation in situ refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments such as wards operating rooms and other settings rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities in biomedical protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins it has tremendous applications for cancer treatment vaccination diagnosis regenerative medicine and therapies for lossoffunction genetic diseases miningedit in situ leaching or in situ recovery refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uraniumimpregnated water to the surface for extraction petroleum productionedit in situ refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to heavy crude oil or bitumen reservoirs beneath the earths crust there are several varieties of in situ techniques but the ones which work best in the oil sands use heat steam the most common type of in situ petroleum production is referred to as sagd steamassisted gravity drainage this is becoming very popular in the alberta oil sands rf transmissionedit in radio frequency rf transmission systems in situ is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is in its standard transmission mode rather than operation in a test mode for example if an in situ wattmeter is used in a commercial broadcast transmission system the wattmeter can accurately measure power while the station is on air spacerelatededit future space exploration or terraforming may rely on obtaining supplies in situ such as previous plans to power the orion space vehicle with fuel minable on the moon the mars direct mission concept is based primarily on the in situ fuel production using sabatier reaction in the space sciences in situ refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in such as the detection of energetic particles in the solar wind or magnetic field measurements from a magnetometer urban planningedit in urban planning insitu upgrading is an approach to and method of upgrading informal settlements vacuum technologyedit in vacuum technology in situ baking refers to heating parts of the vacuum system while they are under vacuum in order to drive off volatile substances that may be absorbed or adsorbed on the walls so they cannot cause outgassing road assistanceedit the term in situ used as repair in situ means to repair a vehicle at the place where it has a breakdown see alsoedit look up in situ in wiktionary the free dictionary
