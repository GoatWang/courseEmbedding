white david read preview article excerpt operational excellence is not the whole story successful companies need privileged assets growthenabling skills and special relationships too how to bundle them into a competitive edge how did gillette a razor blade company justify spending  billion to buy battery maker duracell how has sap europes leading software company managed to sustain such high growth rates and how has entrepreneur li kashing been able to pull off the kinds of deals in china about which others only dream the answer is capabilities the skills assets and relationships that companies assemble to build competitive businesses our research into companies that succeed in sustaining growth for long periods reveals that they think broadly about capabilities naturally some rely on operational skill the narrow definition of capability but a surprising number from our sample thrived by employing less obvious capabilities when businesspeople refer to organizational capabilities they usually mean the skills embedded in a companys people processes and institutional knowledge these are so basic to survival that they are often referred to as core competencies in any competitive environment a company must be good at what it does and possess skills that make it stand out distinctive competencies allow growth companies not only to make more money from existing businesses but also to extract greater value from new opportunities important as operational skills or competencies are to a companys success too narrow a focus on them can stunt growth a broader definition of capability  one that includes all resources useful in gaining competitive advantage  is required in addition to operational skill our definition of capability would include three other classes of resources privileged assets growthenabling skills and special relationships privileged assets privileged assets are physical or intangible assets that are hard to replicate and confer competitive

second to none so big was this opportunity that investors added  billion to the companies combined capitalization in the two days following the announcement of the deal gillette was able to help duracell grow by taking it global this strong domestic player had  percent of the us market but little exposure in such emerging economies as china and india where gillettes network was especially strong brands and reputation strong brands can be extended to launch products without threatening the credibility of the current business gillette has used its brand to enter the market for mens
