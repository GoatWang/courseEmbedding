services  retinoblastoma rb retinoblastoma rb test description genes tested rb mycn copy number changes our lab uses mlpa multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification to look for wholeexon and multiexon deletions and duplications in the rb gene this method simultaneously screens for small intraexon insertions and deletions in rb our lab also performs a qmpcr test to measure mycn copy number in any tumor sample that does not have an rb mutation this test detects a new subset of retinoblastoma with early age at diagnosis distinct histology no rb mutations and huge amplification of the mycn oncogene rushlow d et al  lancet oncology sequence analysis our lab sequences the rb gene core promoter and exons  through  as well as nearby flanking intronic regions our sequence analysis is able to detect mosaic mutations at a level of  or greater we consider reported polymorphisms when designing our sequencing assays to ensure the accuracy of our sequence results splice site analysis we sequence a minimum of  nucleotides flanking each exon of rb to detect changes in splice sites we use in silico analysis and scoring to determine whether a particular change is likely to cause missplicing in the case of an intronic variant of uncertain significance we perform rna transcript analysis on a fresh blood sample at no added charge allelespecific pcr aspcr for eleven recurrent rb mutations our lab uses multiplex aspcr screens for rapid detection of eleven recurrent rb mutations which are then confirmed by sequence analysis the highly sensitive aspcr can detect the eleven mutations at mosaic levels as low as  mutant dna testing for methylation of the rb promoter aberrant methylation of the rb promoter leads to reduced transcription of rb and can initiate unilateral sporadic retinoblastoma in the absence of an rb mutation our lab identifies rb promoter methylation leading to retinoblastoma in approximately  of unilateral sporadic tumors amino acid conservation analysis for missense amino acid changes of uncertain significance we employ several in silico conservation analysis programs to predict whether a particular missense change is likely to be pathogenic in addition when appropriate we will test known affected and unaffected relatives at no charge to clarify variant classification       what is rb    order   order a retinoblastoma rb test downloads

taken a surprising turn back towards a major field of pharmaceutical research current challenges such as emerging multidrugresistant bacteria might be overcome by developments which combine genomic knowledge with applied biology and chemistry to identify produce and alter the structure of new lead compounds significant biological activity is reported much less frequently for synthetic compounds

immense interest due to their broad range of biological activity  from in silico analyses of the lichen genomes  it is obvious that lichens harbor a yet underestimated number of pks and nrps encoding genes as it is also the case for fungal and bacterial natural product producers  as all nrps and type i pks known up to date require a pptase for activity we initially focused on the identification of

abstract in the last decades natural products from lichens have gained more interest for pharmaceutical application due to the broad range of their biological activity however isolation of the compounds of interest directly from the lichen is neither feasible nor sustainable due to slow growth of many lichens in order to develop a pipeline for heterologous expression of lichen biosynthesis

pristinamycin i pi and pristinamycin ii pii semisynthetic derivatives of pi and pii have been approved for use in human medicine to treat a broad range of drugresistant pathogens in this study we design and implement a combinatorial metabolic engineering strategy for improving pii production first an extra copy of the pii biosynthetic gene cluster which was assembled using a modified gibson assembly method for cloning large dna fragments with high gc contents was introduced into a highproducing strain s pristinaespiralis hccb this duplication of the pii biosynthetic gene cluster resulted in a maximum increase in pii titer by  second all seven clustersituated regulatory genes from papr to papr and spbr were systematically manipulated higher pii titers were achieved by deleting either one of the two repressor genes papr or papr in combination with overexpression of both activator genes papr and papr and the resulting strains ∆paprrr and ∆paprrr showed maximum increases in pii production by  and  respectively a combination of the above two different approaches was employed integration of the assembled pii gene cluster bacff into ∆paprrr led to the highest pii titer improvement which was approximately fold higher than the parental strain by adding the macroreticular resin which can separate pristinamycin in situ and thereby lessen endproduct feedback inhibition and toxic effects pii titers of the final engineered strain ∆paprrrbacff reached  and gl in the erlenmeyer flask and l bioreactor respectively with  and fold improvements over the parental strain taken together this combinatorial strategy is an efficient method to optimize pii biosynthesis of s pristinaespiralis and may be extended to other industrially used streptomycetes for strain

revelation of the hidden potential these organisms have for production of natural products baltz  bode and muller  corre and challis  nett et al  scherlach and hertweck  zerikly and challis  in turn this has generated a wide interest in the development of methodologies that could be used for exploitation of this untapped reservoir of metabolites and several different methods ranging from

targeted activation of silent natural product biosynthesis pathways by reporterguided mutant selectionshow abstract hide abstract abstract the continuously increasing genome sequencing data has revealed numerous cryptic pathways which might encode novel secondary metabolites with interesting biological activities however utilization of this hidden potential has been hindered by the observation that many of these gene clusters remain silent or poorly expressed under laboratory conditions here we present reporterguided mutant selection rgms as an effective and widely applicable method for targeted activation of silent gene clusters in the native producers the strategy takes advantage of genomescale random mutagenesis for generation of genetic diversity and a reporterguided selection system for the identification of the desired targetactivated mutants it was first validated in the reactivation of jadomycin biosynthesis in streptomyces venezuelae isp where high efficiency

number of sequenced cyanobacterial genomes this has enabled the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters for structurally diverse metabolites including nonribosomal peptides polyketides ribosomal peptides uvabsorbing compounds alkaloids terpenes and fatty acids while some of the identified biosynthetic gene clusters correlate with known metabolites genome mining also highlights the number and diversity of clusters for which the product is unknown referred to as orphan gene clusters a number of bioinformatics tools have recently been developed in order to predict the products of orphan gene
