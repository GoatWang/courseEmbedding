leasesthe right to enter and drill on the property owners land is accomplished by obtaining a lease  the lease is subject to title search and proper recording in much the same way as real estate many times the bonus for a mineral lease exceeds the value of the property itself  between legal cost for title work and lease bonus wells see costs in excess of  for leasing alone  some leases with multiple mineral and land owners take several months if not years to negotiate and finalize  site preparationmost times a road must be built to the site  good roads are a necessity in order for trucks and heavy equipment to reach the well   once at the site a level area is cleared about  the size of a football field  bulldozers dump trucks excavators and road graders are typically used for this process  general this process takes between  and  weeks but if extensive road work is needed it can take much longer  construction of roads and drilling site is a major cost factor which can easily exceed  per locationdrillingwhen the site is prepared the drilling rig can be moved into position  a rotary rig is the modern equipment used  it is capable of drilling over  feet per day through use of a rotary bit driven by huge engines  fluid or air if forced under pressure down the center of the drill stem to clean out the hole continuously during drilling  the drilling operation is a very complicated one requiring enormous amounts of planning and teamwork  a modern drilling project can encompass the use of  different individual companies to fully complete the process  cost depend on the depth and complexity of the well  modern horizontal well drilling costs can easily exceed  just in the drilling phase  without drilling complications these wells generally take about  weeks for the drilling phase  rig mobilization moving a drilling rig is not a simple task  every time a well is drilling a drilling rig must be moved in and assembled  the process normally takes  days  after the well is drilled the rig must be cleaned and disassembled and moved off location  rig mobilization and assembly expenses vary depending on how far the rig must be transported but generally run between  to  miscellaneous costscosts outlines above are only some of the cost incurred preparing drilling completing and producing of an oil or gas well  in total this complete process will encompass  different individual contracting companies and hundreds of additional minor expenses       drilling before drillingdrilling rigsdrilling proceduresdrilling cost prospects prospectstechniques
