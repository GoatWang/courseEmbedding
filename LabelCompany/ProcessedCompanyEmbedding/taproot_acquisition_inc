and the most recent performance improvement technology the taproot® system is based on advanced proven human performance and equipment reliability technology this knowledge was built into the taproot® system so that every person investigating problems can take advantage of the knowledge of experts without having to spend years studying human and equipment performance taproot® history the rest of the story the taproot® system training and software have a long history of rd and improvement that continues today over  years ago we started with  years of research into human performance and the best incident investigation and root cause analysis systems then we put our knowledge to use to build a systematic investigation process with a coherent investigation philosophy we then used and refined the system in the field we’ve performed formal user testing and informal focus group appraisals in  we wrote the first taproot® manual that put all of this experience together into the best incident investigation system – taproot® but we didn’t stop there we continued improving the system with feedback from thousands of users from our evergrowing international user base we improved the taproot® book and courses and we developed the patented taproot® software to improve investigation productivity our groundbreaking research and development and our continuing improvement efforts are the reasons that taproot® is used by so many industry leaders worldwide but don’t take our word for it instead see what taproot® users have to say about their successes read the success stories that explain how users stopped injuries saved lives improved investigation effectiveness and productivity stopped finger pointing and blame improved equipment reliability and fixed operating problems that saved big bucks analyzing human performance was the original focus of taproot® it still is one of its biggest strengths mark paradies codeveloper of the taproot® system became familiar with advanced human factors technology during his studies at the university of illinois mark had been in the nuclear navy and was familiar with errors that operators and mechanics make even when they are welltrained  have good procedures he learned theories behind human error and advanced concepts to correct human factors problems advanced human factors concepts aren’t very accessible to plant personnel engineers and managers who generally aren’t trained in human factors so mark built these concepts into taproot® this required careful design to include advanced human performance technology without the jargon used by experts mark paradies and codeveloper linda unger crafted a system that includes advanced human performance concepts without being too complex what advanced human factors concepts are in taproot® the list is too long to read here but it includes the sor model of human performance rasmussen’s skillruleknowledge model knowledge of advanced job performance aids the systematic approach to training sat application of cockpit resource management ergonomics anthropometrics communication reliability practices an advanced behavior change model charles hopkins’ human factors theories chris wickens’ concepts on mental models james reason’s swiss cheese model of error paradiesunger’s human performance troubleshooting model you don’t have to learn these concepts have a phd in psychology or hire a human factors expert to take advantage of this technology just answer the questions and follow the guidance that taproot® provides to find the root causes of human error if you are interested in advanced human performance technology that can help you stop human error learn the taproot® system and apply it to fix the root causes of human error equifactor® history besides advanced human performance technology taproot® also has advanced equipment troubleshooting technology built into the system in  mark paradies started working with equipment reliability expert heinz bloch to develop a system to improve the analysis of equipment failure mark andy marquardt and ken reed have worked with heinz to develop a system course and software for equipment troubleshooting and root cause analysis that combines heinz bloch’s techniques with the power of snapchart®s change analysis and the taproot® root cause tree® we called this advanced equipment troubleshooting technology equifactor® in  it was fully integrated into the taproot® book and software to make taproot® the complete root cause analysis system for all types of problems more continuous improvement of course taproot®‘s development didn’t stop there people at system improvements are constantly looking for ways to improve the taproot® system documentation training and software in  they published a completely new taproot® book in  ed skompski and dan verlinde led a software development team who released the initial version  of the taproot® software a complete software rewrite from the ground up keep an eye on the root cause analysis blog for news about all the latest improvements to taproot® how does the taproot® system work the taproot® system is a step investigation process with built in tools that help an investigator like you collect information understand what happened identify the problems that caused the incident analyze each problem’s root causes look beyond root causes for systemic cultural and organizational factors develop fixes to improve performance and stop repeat incidents present what’s been learned to management so they can understand and approve the fixes the first steps of the step investigation process are to plan the investigation collect information and understand what happened the investigator draws a snapchart® to understand what happened and to organize the information about what happened below is a simple snapchart® that a team has started to build about a simple accident – a sprained ankle the initial investigation work will uncover more information about the incident’s events until the investigator or team can completely understand what happened then they can identify all the causal factors problems that came together to cause the accidentincident these causal factors can be displayed on a more advanced snapchart® as in the snapchart® below once the investigators have identified all the causal factors they can analyze each of the problems to determine the problems’ root causes a causal factor can have more than one “root cause” taproot® has a special tool the root cause tree® and dictionary to help investigators find root causes of the causal factors the root cause tree® is a copyrighted trademarked and patented in the software tool for analysis of root causes it was initially developed by mark paradies david busch and linda unger to help people perform better root cause analysis of human performance and equipment reliability problems it uses the latest human performance and equipment reliability technology to help investigators in the field find root causes it has extensive development history including testing in many industries and feedback from users around the world the root cause tree® has seven basic cause categories one of the basic cause categories – procedures graphic below – shows the root cause level that investigators strive to reach the graphic also shows the human factors research that is built into the procedures section also built into the root cause tree® is a question human performance troubleshooting guide that helps investigators dig into human errors to find their root causes by considering a wide range of factors three of the questions are shown below to demonstrate how the human performance troubleshooting guide gets investigators to consider different areas that could contribute to human error to ensure consistent use of the root cause tree® the root cause tree® dictionary was written to clearly define each of the categoriesroot causes and guide investigators to the root causes of human performance problems once all the root causes have been identified for a problem the taproot® system then helps the investigator look for generic causes big picture problems related to culture systemic and organizational problems once the root and generic causes have been identified the investigator can use the corrective action helper® and smarter tools to develop effective corrective actions to prevent future problems finally taproot® tools can be used to present what was found to management and others that’s how the taproot® system helps solve problems the taproot® training teaches investigators how to effectively use each tool in a systematic investigation process using taproot® will become second nature – as it has for the  people who are trained each year to use taproot® using taproot® can be simplified for quick easy investigations thus taproot® is flexible it can be used for analyzing simple incidents or minor equipment failures or significant accidents that cost lives and millions of dollars see the range of applications of taproot® by reviewing the success stories here the whole

no comments » is there just one root cause for a major accident posted july th  in accidents courses investigations pictures root cause analysis tips root causes taproot some people might say that the officer of the deck on the uss fitzgerald goofed up he turned in front of a containership and caused an accident wait a second major accidents are never that simple there are almost always multiple things that went wrong multiple “causal factors” that could be eliminated and … if they were … would have prevented the accident or significantly reduced the accident’s consequences the “one root cause” assumption gets many investigators in trouble when performing a root cause analysis they think they can ask why five times and find the root cause taproot® investigators never make this “single root cause” mistake they start by developing a complete sequence of events that led to the accident they do this by drawing a snapchart® either using yellow stickies or using the taproot® software they then use one of several methods to make sure they identify all the causal factors when they have identified the causal factors they aren’t done they are just getting started each of the causal factors are taken through the taproot® root cause tree® using the root cause tree® dictionary  and all the root cause for each causal factor are identified that’s right there may be more than one root cause for each causal factor think of it as there may be more than one best practice to implement to prevent that causal factor from happening again taproot® investigators go even one step further they look for generic causes what is a generic cause the system problem that allowed the root cause to exist here’s a simple example let’s say that you find a simple typo in a procedure that typo cause an error of course you would fix the typo but you would also ask … why was the typo allowed to exist wasn’t there a proofing process why didn’t operators who used the procedure in the past report the problem they spotted assuming that this is the first time there was an error and the procedure had been used before you might find that there is an ineffective proofing process or that the proofing process isn’t being performed you might find that operators had previously reported the problem but it had never been fixed if you find there is a generic cause you then have to think about all the other procedures that might have similar problems and how to fix the system problem or problems of course ideas to help you do this are included in the taproot® corrective action helper® guide so in a major accident like the wreck of the uss fitzgerald there are probably multiple mistakes that were made multiple causal factors multiple root causes some generic causes and lots of corrective actions that could improve performance and stop future collisions to learn advanced root cause analysis attend a public taproot® courses see the dates and locations here httpwwwtaprootcomstorecourses

retrofitted busses posted july th  in accidents this week’s lesson learned isn’t necessarily coming from an accident but from something that was caught that could have resulted in fatalities if an accident occurs ultimately the lesson here is proactivity if you’re proactive in your investigations you can create corrective actions to prevent accidents from ever occurring in russia it was found that the seats on busses were not bolted down effectively although the transportation companies complied with the regulations for seat anchoring when they were manufactured the regulations have changed due to old seat anchoring practices being unsafe previously the bolts were not properly securing the seats therefore if there was a collision the bolts could easily be pulled from the floor allowing the passengers to be injured or even killed the corrective action for this proactive investigation is to inspect all public transportation vehicles and ensure that they comply with current safety regulations if they don’t they need to be fixed immediately no comments » where did you eat last weekend or why do companies continue to not learn from their mistakes posted july th  in current

this is a question that i’m frequently asked  of course the answer is … it depends depends on what how complex is the incident are there complex tests that need to be performed to troubleshoot equipment issues is everyone available to be interviewed is there regulatory coordinationinterference for instance … do they take control of the scene or the evidence how far do you want to dig into generic causes what level of proof do you need to support your conclusions however i believe most investigations should be completed in a couple of weeks or at most a couple of months now for the exceptions… regulatory delays we helped facilitate a major investigation that was progressing until the regulators took the evidence they stated that they needed it for their investigation their investigation dragged on for over a year finally they announced their findings and released the evidence back to the company it turned out that none of the evidence sequestered by the government had anything to do with the reason for their investigation being delayed they were doing complex modeling and videos to demonstrate their conclusions after about an additional two months the company investigation was completed the companies investigation was delayed for over a year unnecessarily  slow investigation delayed by uncooperative participants one of the longest root cause analyses i’ve ever seen took four years the agency performing the investigation is notoriously slow when performing investigations but this investigation was slow even by their standards what happened the investigation had multiple parties that were suing each other over the accident and some of the parties would not comply with a subpoena the agency had to take the unwilling participant to court eventually the evidence was provided but it took almost a year for the process to play out slow investigation processes the most recent bad example is the alison canyon natural gas storage leak root cause analysis the investigation started when the leak was stopped  months ago but the root cause analysis still is not finished why is seems the process is mired in public hearings the spokesperson for the california public utilities commission said that the “study” was in the third phase of a five phase process what was slowing the “study” root cause analysis and corrective actions down public hearings here is what an article in ngi daily gas prices said “a california public utilities commission spokesperson said the study remains in the third of a fivephase process that is to take more than three years the third phase is expected to take up to nine months and the fourth phase more than two months before the final phase of “integration and interpretation” of the results is issued“ the process is scheduled to take three years that definitely makes any kind of timely root cause analysis impossible  conclusion many people complain about the time it takes for a good root cause analysis but most excessive delays have nothing to do with the root cause analysis process that is chosen excessive delays are usually political due to uncooperative participants or regulatory red tape  don’t try to save time on an investigation by picking the fastest root causes analysis tool for example … spinacause™ rather pick an advanced root cause analysis tool taproot® that will get you superior results in a reasonable amount of time and effort  one more idea… learn from smaller but significant incidents to avoid major accidents that have huge public relations and regulatory complications learning from smaller incidents can be much faster and save considerable headaches and money   comment » next  connect with us filter news select a category accidents best practice

stopping human error course humans are often considered the weakest link in the industrial or occupational system  we are often blamed when something goes wrong in the system  however we are also one of the most valuable links in the system if one considers our adaptability flexibility tolerance for inadequate feedback and less than optimum working conditions and our ability to compensate for wrong or inadequate instructions and expectations   because we are so flexible adaptable tolerant and capable of the use of judgment and experience we are in fact a blessing and a curse  the curse means we can make decisions and take actions that the system cannot tolerate   while we may claim to have a goal of zero injuries or incidents we will never have zero errors  human error is inevitable unless we want to somehow constrain that judgment flexibility adaptability and tolerance   so our goal is to understand human error how humans operate…what our capacities constraints and needs are so that we can maximize performance and minimize errors this course is built around the goal of helping us better understand human errors analysis prediction and categorization and why we make them   more importantly the course will cover solutions to assist attendees in their quest to minimize errors and resulting impact in their own facilities  the tools that will be discussed can be used in conjunction with your taproot® findings and can be incorporated as corrective actions as determined by your root cause analysis findings there will be plenty of handson exercises included in the twoday course   to make the course more interesting please bring an unsolved application error case from your operations and we’ll try to dissect and solve it during the course upon completion of the
