quarter  earnings call we had a phenomenal fourth quarter and full year  where we again saw spark produce record earnings ill make a few opening remarks about our operating results and then ill turn the call over to our cfo robert lane to provide some detail on the financial results we’ll then conclude with questions from our analysts we recorded  million in adjusted ebitda in  including  million in the fourth quarter alone when you consider we finished  with  million in adjusted ebitda for the full year you can really appreciate how weve successfully executed on our strategic growth initiatives in ‘ from a retail gross margin perspective we finished  with  million for the calendar year an increase of  over last year in the fourth quarter alone we generated  million in retail gross margin an increase of  yearoveryear we experienced increased volumes in our electricity and natural gas segments primarily as a result of our major and provider acquisitions midyear warmer than normal weather in the fourth quarter had a negative impact on throughput but this was largely offset by expanded unit margins driven by continued low commodity price environment our inhouse supply and portfolio management teams have done a fantastic job in optimizing our supply costs as well as our retail pricing structures we finished  with  rces on flow an increase of  rces over last year this represents an astonishing  growth yearoveryear the majority of this growth was fueled by our acquisitions of major energy and provider power but we were also realizing organic growth of  over the course of the year as you may recall weve previously signaled our intent to grow organically at single digit percentages and were very proud to have executed on this in  while closing two significant acquisitions along the way as i mentioned on the last call i would like to point out that our rce count does not include the contribution from our joint venture in japan which began enrolling customers almost a year ago and as of december  has enrolled more than  customers and is expected to turn a slight profit in its first full year of operation on the attrition front we ended  with a  attrition rate an improvement of  over last years  rate we continue to have success in customer retention and now with eight different brands were running a multitude of crossselling and wind back opportunities the biggest driver of our improved attrition has been our emphasis on sales quality and compliance in  as mentioned in prior quarters the revamping of our vendor commission structures as well as additional sales oversight and compliance has resulted in our new customer ads being both larger and stickier than what we saw in the past while we believe we could manage our attrition metric down further in the coming quarters were confident that we optimize customer lifetime value and therefore shareholder value with attrition in the current range turning to ma for a moment id like to give you a brief update on our two acquisitions from  provider power and major energy we are virtually complete with the integration of provider at this point and we are realizing the synergies we anticipated from a performance standpoint provider has outperformed our projections both in terms of successfully renewing our customer base as well as adding both residential and commercial customers at a rate well beyond our expectations as you know major energy has an earnout that extends over multiple years so our focus has been on finance and supply integration while leaving the rest of the business to operate independently at the end of this month majors credit facility arrangement terminates at which time we will pick up approximately  million to  million in annual synergies from our supply team taking over the major portfolio in terms of new transactions we recently entered into an agreement with national gas  electric for the acquisition of approximately  rces with an option to acquire an additional  rces we will pay approximately  million in cash for this transaction subject to working capital adjustments and we anticipate exercising the option shortly after closing this transaction was reviewed and approved by a special committee of our board and we expect this transaction to close early next month in addition the nge and spark business development teams are working on several additional transactions but were not ready to provide much color at this time i can tell you that we have a couple of deals under loi and if we were to close on all of these we would increase our adjusted ebitda annual run rate by approximately  million to  million we are reaffirming our guidance for  in the range of  million to  million in adjusted ebitda this is based off of an anticipated  million to  million spend in customer acquisition costs while i cannot say too much about  results i can share with you that our extremely strong performance in  has carried over into ‘ both in terms of organic sales as well as strong unit margins in the face of mild weather given this fact along with the pending acquisition i just highlighted and potential transactions currently under loi we will be updating our guidance in the near future in summary i could not be more pleased with how hard our company has worked along with our new acquisitions in major and provider to produce  million in adjusted ebitda in  thanks for your attention and with that i will now turn the call over to rob for his financial review robert lane good morning and thank you nathan as nathan mentioned we are extremely pleased with our  and fourth quarter results for the year ended december   we produced  million of adjusted ebitda compared to  million last year an increase of  in the fourth quarter we achieved  million in adjusted ebitda an increase of  over last fourth quarter’s  million while the primary driver of these increases was the acquisitions of major and provider we continue to optimize our unit margin and maintain a low cost highly scalable operating structure retail gross margin for the quarter was  million compared to  million last year an increase of  million on the ga side expenses were up  million over last year to  million primarily due to variable costs associated with the larger rce portfolio as well as some onetime charges associated with the termination of certain contracts at the major energy company absent the onetime charges related to the acquisitions our ga for the quarter increased only  compared to the much larger  increase in retail gross margin which attests to the strong scalability of our platform this increase was offset by a significant reduction in bad debt expense as we mentioned last quarter we have brought our collection efforts now fully in house and have even been able to collect on accounts previously written off we spent  million to acquire customers during the quarter this resulted in us adding a  rces after replacing attrition our rce count of  at the end of the year represents an increases of  over our position at the end of  a result not only of our ma activity but also strong organic growth especially in the second half of the year interest expense for the year rose from  million to  million as we mentioned in the last quarterly update this is a result of the increase in debt we experienced due to our acquisitions coupled with increased working capital requirements associated with higher collateral posting requirements as we continue to grow the portfolio income tax expense for the year increased to  million as compared to  million for  primarily due to our strong operating and financial results our net income for the most recent quarter was  million or a  per diluted share compared to  million and a negative  per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of  for the full year ended december   our net income was  million or  per fully diluted share compared to  million and a  per fully diluted share for  as we have mentioned before our management team focuses more on our nongaap measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin both of which were adjusted to remove the noncash effect of our supply hedges and captured the as incurred expense organic customer acquisition in replacement on december  we paid a quarterly cash dividend for the third quarter of  cents per share more recently on january  we announced that our fourth quarter dividend of  cents per share will be paid on march   as weve stated in the past we expect to continue paying this quarterly dividend on a go forward basis thats all i have back to you nathan nathan kroeker thanks rob so just to recap we saw phenomenal growth over the course of  and a very strong finish to the year driven by our two successful acquisition supply and pricing optimization impacts on unit margins organic growth and realizing scale against our cost structure we also have a great start to  with several acquisition targets on the radar continued refinement of our sales and marketing strategy and strong unit margins as a result of the continued soft commodity market and with that we will now open the line for questions from our analysts operator questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from line of carter driscoll with fbr carter driscoll so i appreciate all the details and obviously an excellent job on  maybe my first question i really cant say a lot about your lois but is there a way you could characterize maybe the number of targets youre looking at that would compromise that range of incremental ebitda as youre talking about is it one or is it a couple i’m just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of the book andor companies youre looking at nathan kroeker look were very comfortable with where the pipeline is at this point i mean theres a handful of different target that were talking to there are only  theres you know three that are under contract for loi at this point and im not going to give you specifics on those three but when you look at the handful of targets that we’re in various stages of discussion on i will tell you that they range from several million of ebitda up to   million of ebitda i mean there are some sizable companies that we are talking to carter driscoll and your preferred method of capital to if you execute on say one of the larger ones could be what mix and there is one more followup if i may nathan kroeker so were very comfortable where our capital structure is right now i mean with our  to  million for next year weve got a lot of free cash flow from operations weve got the  million credit facility with our parent that’s a very attractive  which you know theres nothing drawn on that today we also have some additional room under our existing credit facility and were currently evaluating both debt and equity options as well so i mean we have a number of tools in the tool chest in order for continuing to grow through ma carter driscoll could you talk just about the  to a better understanding of the writeup to ga from the major contract terminations can you just give me a little color on the mechanics of that i’m sorry and then i have one last follow up robert lane sure ill try to answer your question if im not doing it let me know but basically these are just some contracts that were terminated as a result of our integration with major and the change of control provisions that total charge was  million its actually getting paid out over the next couple of years whatever detail i can give you i’m happy to do so but normal course of business indiscernible carter driscoll so specifically the change of control that triggered the ability for certain customers to opt out is that the way to characterize it nathan kroeker it wasnt actually customers it was more some employees and some other people like that so it wasn’t customers that had opted out at all and thats why we ran into the ga line and not to reach our gross margins carter driscoll and maybe just a bit of a spike in dsos and payables this quarter something characterized particular color what bucket whether they came from the acquisitions or just running a larger book now nathan kroeker it’s two things one obviously we brought on a whole bunch of those two big acquisitions and it’s just seasonality we had some really cold weather going to be end of the year and especially in new england and new york and so because of that just cost of our power was and natural gas was a little higher carter driscoll and then just last question nathan maybe you can characterize obviously very public ongoing dispute with the state of new york not just yourself with other retailers just give us an update where that stands in characterization of what you envision the potential indiscernible could be from whats going on in the state of new york nathan kroeker sure i mean as you pointed out it’s an interesting time in the industry in new york were very happy that the court cited with us earlier in  the commission is asking for additional information from all of us which were happy to provide were working closely with them but basically at this point in time i mean we are appealing the commission of jurisdiction over rate setting and pricing and we want to know the outcome of that appeal for a number of months but if that appeal wins i would say that really cut the legs out from underneath the commission in terms of what impact they can have on retail energy space and specific retailers and products and pricing if we lose that appeal then we get into the alternative scenario that i described on prior calls where we’ll work very collaboratively with the commission to come up with a set of supposed rule changes or market changes that weed out some of the bad actors but leave a healthy market for good companies to participate in and im not anticipating you know im fully expecting that were going to have a healthy market beyond  or beyond ‘ and ‘ and going forward and well be able to comply with whatever changes we collectively determine we need to make in that market operator your next question comes from liam burke with wunderlich liam burke nathan you talked about a fairly decent backlog of acquisitions do you see any pricing changes out there or any additional competition for potential purchases nathan kroeker in the last few quarters i mean weve seen calpine look at a few transactions but thats really the only new buyer that weve seen and my sense is calpine might be full up on acquisitions now based on what im reading so other than that really no i mean most of these are what weve been doing in the past which are bilateral negotiations its a function of us being able to come up with creative deal structure that works for the sellers and we can execute quickly i mean one of the things about it is were flexible were nimble and we can get deals done that maybe others cant and thats very attractive to sellers in terms of where deals are pricing i really havent seen a change in the last few quarters i still think that every one of these deals that were talking about are deals that we could get done in a three to four times range that would be immediately accretive to earnings liam burke and rob on the free cash flow given fairly tight guidance on ebitda customer acquisition costs which would all go into the mix there wasn’t seasonality in working capital which would probably affect cash flows in  do you anticipate any material changes any of those variables robert lane we still expect to see some seasonality pretty much goes with the gas curve i think that drives both our power prices and our natural gas prices generally i think we’re just going to see the same but more of it as we go forward into ‘ operator your next question comes from mike gyure with janney mike gyure can you guys touch a little bit more on your customer acquisition cost spending for next year and guess where youre targeting i guess that money to be spent maybe markets or kind of in the mix of industry kind of what youre looking for there nathan kroeker we’ve signaled that were going to spend  million to  million in cac i still think thats a good number were really looking at where the opportunities are right now this part of the year i’d say it’s pretty well spread across our footprint in the us but were going to continue to look at where the opportunities are and the good news is we can shift those dollars from one market to another if the supply situation changes or regulatory environment changes or customer opportunity changes so pretty flexible in terms of what were going to do in  mike gyure an then maybe lastly on the joint venture in japan can you talk a little bit of i guess about that market and then maybe the market potential for other international markets you guys are looking at nathan kroeker so japan is the single  its essentially its a pjm under one common set of rules so it’s the largest electricity market ever to be regulated under one common set of rules in the history of the world so you have to pay attention to it thats the good news the bad news is its a difficult market to get into if youre not from japan so were very fortunate to have a good joint venture partner that weve developed a relationship with over the last number of years that owns generation that has experience on the large dni retail and we bring a lot of sales and marketing and energy management expertise to the table while they have a lot of the local relationships and culture and together i think its a very effective partnership theres just a tremendous amount of interest in japan right now in terms of consumers looking at alternatives switching as well as market entrants eager to get into that market so were very optimistic about what that could translate into over the next several years but as i said on some of the prior quarters were not going to spend a lot of time talking about it until it becomes material to our overall financials and were not there yet in terms of other markets we are looking at the uk and looking at germany but we dont have anything that we are ready to announce just yet operator your next question comes from the line of tanner james with ladenburg thalmann tanner james just a quick question how should we think about the accounting impact and income statement impact from the recently announced acquisition from nge robert lane just from the accounting impact we’ll probably have some period where we end up having to do a recast given when they bought it but it’s probably going to be immaterial at least for that time period and anything that we do have which is full rights to the noncontrolling interest same as the major operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of sophie karp with guggenheim sophie karp hi guys thank you for taking my question congrats on a strong quarter just real quick to confirm your  you reiterated the guidance of  million to  million for this year for the ebitda does that include the current lois or is that the lois are going to be additive to that nathan kroeker thanks for asking sophie and welcome to our call im glad you asked that note just to be clear the  to  is for our existing business only the deal that we just announced that we expect to close in the next several weeks would be additives to that number and then the other lois that weve currently signed and are working at closing would also be added to that number so thats why were going to come back in the next several weeks and update the guidance sophie karp great great thanks for confirming that and then could you maybe comment on i was amused that the spark spread report that basically said that you may be looking at some statistic alternatives for your business nathan kroeker we really cant comment on market speculation at this point operator we have no further questions at this time i’d like to turn the call back to mr kroeker for any closing remarks nathan kroeker i just want to thank everybody again for participating in todays call and we look forward to talking to you soon operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in todays conference this concludes the
