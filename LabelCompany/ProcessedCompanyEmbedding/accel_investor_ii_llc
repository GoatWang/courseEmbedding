investing a lot exiting a bit september   by joanna glasner sometimes it’s hard to remember that accel partners has done other things besides back facebook the firm made so much from that one investment that limited partners in the fund that backed it stand to reap among the largest returns in venture history  even with facebook’s plummeting postipo stock price accel’s  stake the company which it secured primarily with a  million investment in 0 was still worth more than  billion as of late last week but truth is most of accel’s limited partners won’t profit from the facebook investment that’s because only a handful actually invested in accel ix the 00 million 00 vintage fund that backed the social network the vast majority of the money accel has under management comes from later vintage funds so how are those funds doing overall it’s too early to make any definitive judgment as the bulk of the more than  billion it has under management comes from funds raised in  or later which makes for a fairly immature portfolio by venture standards two vehicles – the accel big data fund and accel growth fund ii – just closed in 0 still it’s intriguing to take a peak under the hood to see what other big hits accel has had or stands to generate from its current portfolio over the past year at least five portfolio companies have gone public in the past year of those the largest is groupon in which accel has a stake of just over  percent while the daily deals provider’s current market capitalization of  billion is way down from its peak valuation accel still stands to win on that one having come in as an early stage investor  the firm also owns about  of online travel provider kayak software – a stake worth about 0 million at recent share prices vcj subscribers can read more and see a table of recent accel exits by clicking here on the ma front accel’s performance is more difficult to gauge the firm declined to respond to questions for this story including ones about returns from recently acquired portfolio companies still it appears that several provided a positive outcome one was amobee a provider of mobile advertising services that raised early and later stage capital from accel so how does the road ahead look my broad take is as follows accel already one of the older and betterknown silicon valley venture firms got a major reputation boost from its investment in facebook this helped to raise a lot of money for for more recent generalist and specialist funds since then accel has been investing like crazy – backing something like  rounds this year according to the thomson reuters database which often misses smaller seed rounds photo of facebook’s share price the day of its ipo from reuters take your pick buyouts delivers exclusive news and
