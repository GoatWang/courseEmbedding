moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “this material focuses primarily on marketing because that is where the leadership must come from” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “the numberone corporate objective when crossing the chasm is to secure a distribution channel into the mainstream market one with which the pragmatist customer will be comfortable this objective comes before revenues before profits before press even before customer satisfaction all these other factors can be fixed later  but only if the channel is established” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like “there is something fundamentally different between a sale to an early adopter and a sale to the early majority even” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “the company may be saying “stateoftheart” when the pragmatist wants to hear “industry standard” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “you get installed by the pragmatists as the leader and from then on they conspire to help keep you there” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “entering the mainstream market is an act of burglary of breaking and entering of deception often even of stealth” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “customers often bend over backward to give market share leaders second and third chances bringing cries of anguish from their competitors who would never be granted such grace” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “one of the most important lessons about crossing the chasm is that the task ultimately requires achieving an unusual degree of company unity during the crossing period” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “segways are a classic example of this phenomenon youve seen them on occasion in malls or in airports looking something like an oldfashioned lawn mower gone vertical ridden around by someone in a security professionals uniform kind of dorky looking but dont kid yourself the gyroscopic balance control is fabulous and the control movements once mastered are graceful the hope was these devices would become a universal transport mechanism why didnt that happen in a word stairs stairs are pesky little devils that crop up everywhere and segways do not handle them well at all thats what we call a showstopper” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like “chasm crossing is not the end but rather the beginning of mainstream market development” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “when pragmatists buy they care about the company they are buying from the quality of the product they are buying the infrastructure of supporting products and system interfaces and the reliability of the service they are going to get” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like “oh to be sure there are the getrich dreams that float in and out of idle conversation but there are much headier rewards closer at hand  the freedom to be your own boss and chart your own course the chance to explore the leading edge of some new technology the careeropening opportunity to take on far more responsibility than any established organisation would ever grant these are what really drive early market organisations to work such long hours for such modest rewards  the dream of getting rich on equity is only an excuse something to hold on to your family and friends as a rationale for all this otherwise crazy behavior” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like “surround your disruptive core product the thing that got you to the dance with a whole product that solves for the target customer’s problem end to end that will keep you on the dance floor for a long time to come the” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “california is a bad influence” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “the less successful product is often arguably superior not content to slink off the stage without some revenge this sullen and resentful crew casts about among themselves to find a scapegoat and whom do they light upon with unfailing consistency and unerring accuracy all fingers point to—the vice president of marketing it is marketing’s fault salesforce outmarketed rightnow linkedin outmarketed plaxo akamai outmarketed internap rackspace outmarketed terremark” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “there are two keys to this entire sequence the first is knocking over the head pin taking the beachhead crossing the chasm and chaining together three mixed metaphors to do it the size of the first pin is not the issue but the economic value of the problem it fixes is the more serious the problem the faster the target niche will pull you out of the chasm once out your opportunities to expand into other niches are immensely increased because now having one set of pragmatist customers solidly behind you you are much less risky for others to back as a new vendor the” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “to get an early market started requires an entrepreneurial company with a breakthrough technology product that enables a new and compelling application a technology enthusiast who can evaluate and appreciate the superiority of the product over current alternatives and a wellheeled visionary who can foresee an orderofmagnitude improvement from implementing the new application” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “the key to getting beyond the enthusiasts and winning over a visionary is to show that the new technology enables some strategic leap forward something never before possible which has an intrinsic value and appeal to the nontechnologist” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “by contrast the early majority want to buy a productivity improvement for existing operations they are looking to minimize the discontinuity with the old ways they want evolution not revolution they want technology to enhance not overthrow the established ways of doing business and above all they do not want to debug somebody else’s product by the time they adopt it they want it to work properly and to integrate appropriately with their existing technology base” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “the only suitable reference for an early majority customer it turns out is another member of the early majority but no upstanding member of the early majority will buy without first having consulted with several suitable references” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “the single most important difference between early markets and mainstream markets is that the former are willing to take responsibility for piecing together the whole product in return for getting a jump on their competition whereas the latter are not” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “unfortunately however pragmatist customers rarely adopt any new technology en masse usually these innovations are taken up first by a single niche one that has such pressing problems it goes ahead of the herd the rest of the herd is delighted by this eventuality because it gets a free look at how well the technology plays out without having to take any immediate risk the niche wins—presuming the beachhead strategy is conducted correctly—by getting a stateoftheart fix for its heretofore unsolvable problem and the vendor wins because it gets certified by at least one segment of pragmatists that its offering is legitimately mainstream” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “one of the most important lessons about crossing the chasm is that the task ultimately requires achieving an unusual degree of company unity during the crossing period this is a time when one should forgo the quest for eccentric marketing genius in favor of achieving an informed consensus among mere mortals it is a time not for dashing and expensive gestures but rather for careful plans and cautiously rationed resourcesa time not to gamble all on some brilliant coup but rather to focus everyone on pursuing a highprobability course of action and making as few mistakes as possible” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like “the numberone corporate objective when crossing the chasm is to secure a distribution channel into the mainstream market one with which the pragmatist customer will be comfortable” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “because of these incompatibilities early adopters do not make good references for the early majority and because of the early majority’s concern not to disrupt their organizations good references are critical to their buying decisions so what we have here is a catch the only suitable reference for an early majority customer it turns out is another member of the early majority but no upstanding member of the early majority will buy without first having consulted with several suitable references” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “when crossing the chasm we are looking to attract customeroriented distribution with one of our primary lures being distributionoriented pricing customeroriented” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling disruptive products to mainstream customers  likes like “indeed a truly predatory type of investor  sometimes referred to as a vulture capitalist  looks to use the chasm period of struggle and failure as a means to discredit the current management thereby driving down the equity value in the company so that in the next round of funding he or she has an opportunity to secure dominant control of the company install a new management team and worst case become the owner of the major technology asset dirt cheap this is an incredibly destructive exercise during which not only the baby and the bathwater but all human values and winning opportunities are thrown out the window nonetheless it happens” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like “as soon as the numbers get up in a chart  or better yet a graph  as soon as they thus become blessed with some specious authenticity they become the drivers in highrisk lowdata situations because these people are so anxious to have data thats when you hear them saying things like it will be a billiondollar market in  if we only get five percent of that market when you hear that sort of stuff exit gracefully holding on to your wallet” ― geoffrey a moore crossing the chasm marketing and selling hightech products to mainstream customers  likes like « previous   next » all quotes quotes by geoffrey a moore play the guess that
