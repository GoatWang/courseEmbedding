anything through this place stay away i purchased my bed set from this aarons inc from sunnyvale thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products i was wrong when i thought i was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products i was actually purchasing nasty crawling bed bugs i should of known it all started from the beginning from the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlersdrivers they told me that driver was going too fast and that the headboard was scratched and scraped aarons representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this accident they need to delay my delivery for another week keep in mind that i requested and was confirmed by aarons that i would have an early delivery so i would have it in time before my movein date when delivering my mattress the following week aarons delivery driverpackage handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector when i asked the driver driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used hence the bed bugs after two months i noticed more than  blackred spots inside the mattress protector that came from aarons as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector they were all around the mattress when contacting aarons at am october th  by email to markus sales manager who i purchased and made an agreement for the mattress i was upset and traumatized i couldnt even sleep in my own bed that night later that day at am i was contacted by aarons representative delivery person who delivered my products stating to me that they received the email and that markus was no longer with the company he then told me that he emailed the regional manager andy and also contacted orkin who will contact me directly after many calls to the store about the situation urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room about pm i then spoke to ismael aarons representative that i just needed them to take the mattress out ismael then told me that i will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still i was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional ismael then stated that he didnt to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not at about pm i spoke to ismael again and he stated that the store manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment it was about pm that i contacted the store again and i was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done finally at pm store manager unisex i am not sure how to spell his name picked up the mattress and took it out of the room he told me that orkin should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his regional manager about the situation when telling him about the situation about ismael stating that i will have to still make payments his response was in order for me to not pay for the productitem orkin will have to make a report stating that the bed bugs came from the mattress not the room on october th  orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation orkin then called later that day stating that they couldnt make it the orkin representative stated that he will be calling me the next day orkin did not call until the following day orkin representative called back at pm orkin representative stated that he spoke with andrewregional manager from aarons company and andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and thats where the problem came from that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises finally the regional manager andy contacted me he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress keep in mind that the inspector from orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isnt not infestation in the unit he said that my agreement will be inactive and i will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system this regional manager is a joke completely protecting his company saying that it didnt have to do with the mattress he stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a vlock mattress and that if i think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh he is very unprofessional and he reflects on why this store and company is not worth taking the

productitem orkin will have to make a report stating that the bed bugs came from the mattress not the room on october th  orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation orkin then called later that day stating that they couldnt make it the orkin representative stated that he will be calling me the next day orkin did not call until the following day orkin representative called back at pm orkin representative stated that he spoke with andrewregional manager from aarons company and andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and thats where the problem came from that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises finally the regional manager andy contacted me he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress keep in mind that the inspector from orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isnt not infestation in the unit he said that my agreement will be inactive and i will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system this regional manager is a joke completely protecting his company saying that it didnt have to do with the mattress he stated that the mattress did not come with a plastic because they had to input the mattress protector ahead of time because its a vlock mattress and that if i think the bed bugs came from the truck on its way over to my unit and started to laugh he is very unprofessional

bed set from this aarons inc from sunnyvale thinking of having a great experience and the quality of service of the products i was wrong when i thought i was purchasing a brand new bed mattress and bed products i was actually purchasing nasty crawling bed bugs i should of known it all started from the beginning from the shipment of the furniture being cancelled and postpone due to furniture damage because of lack of care and caution of the package handlersdrivers they told me that driver was going too fast and  that the headboard was scratched and scraped aarons representatives contacted me directly stating that because of this accident they need to delay my delivery for another week keep in mind that i requested and was confirmed by aarons that i would have an early delivery so i would have it in time before my movein date when delivering my mattress the following week aarons delivery driverpackage handler delivered my mattress with no plastic cover but instead just a mattress cloth protector when i asked the driver driver stated that the mattress was brand new but it looked like to was used hence the bed bugs after two months i noticed more than  blackred spots inside the mattress protector that came from aarons as if the bed bugs were suffocate inside the mattress protector they were all around the mattress when contacting aarons at am october th  by email to markus sales manager who i purchased and made an agreement for the mattress i was upset and traumatized i couldnt even sleep in my own bed that night later that day at am i was contacted by aarons representative delivery person who delivered my products stating to me that they received the email and that markus was no longer with the company he then told me that he emailed the regional manager andy and also contacted orkin who will contact me directly after many calls to the store about the situation urging them to pick up the mattress and get it out of my room about pm i then spoke to ismael aarons representative that i just needed them to take the mattress out ismael then told me that i will have to still make payments on the mattress and it was my responsibility still i was pissed and frustrated at this point but wanted to keep it professional ismael then stated that he didnt to find out if they were able to pick up the mattress or not at about pm i spoke to ismael again and he stated that the store manager was out doing shipments and that he will pick up the mattress by the end of the last shipment it was about pm that i contacted the store again and i was told that the shipments are still being done and that two more shipments needed to get done finally at pm store manager unisex i am not sure how to spell his name picked up the mattress and took it out of the room he told me that orkin should be contacting me directly and that he is speaking to his regional manager about the situation when telling him about the situation about ismael stating that i will have to still make payments his response was in order for me to not pay for the productitem orkin will have to make a report stating that the bed bugs came from the mattress not the room on october th  orkin contact me directly and scheduled an appointment to come in and check the situation orkin then called later that day stating that they couldnt make it the orkin representative stated that he will be calling me the next day orkin did not call until the following day orkin representative called back at pm orkin representative stated that he spoke with andrewregional manager from aarons company and andrew stated to him that the store took possession of the mattress that was infested with bed begs and thats where the problem came from that the premises did not need to be inspected because the problem was resolved and removed from premises finally the regional manager andy contacted me he stated that the mattress was new and that bed bugs are able to transport from my clothes to the mattress keep in mind that the inspector from orkin came to inspect today and stated that their isnt not infestation in the unit he said that my agreement will be inactive and i will not have to pay for it anymore but will see how long it will take them to update their system this regional manager is a joke completely protecting his company saying that it didnt have to do with the mattress he
