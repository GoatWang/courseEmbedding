operations and financial position taken as a whole actual results may vary from the estimates and assumptions we make overview red metal resources ltd red metal or the company is a mineral exploration company engaged in locating and eventually developing mineral resources in chile our business strategy is to identify acquire and explore prospective mineral claims with a view to either developing them ourselves or more likely finding a joint venture partner with the mining experience and financial means to undertake the development all of our claims are in the candelaria iocg belt in the chilean coastal cordillera consistent with our historical practices we continue to monitor our costs in chile by reviewing our mineral claims to determine whether they possess the geological indicators to economically justify the capital to maintain or explore them currently our subsidiary minera polymet spa has two employees in chile and engages independent consultants on as needed basis most of our support  such as vehicles office and equipment  is supplied under shortterm contracts the only longterm commitments that we have are for royalty payments on four of our mineral claims  farellon alto  quina    exeter    and che these royalties are payable once exploitation begins we are also required to pay property taxes that are due annually on all the claims that are included in our properties the cost and timing of all planned exploration programs are subject to the availability of qualified mining personnel such as consulting geologists geotechnicians and drillers and drilling equipment although chile has a welltrained and qualified mining workforce from which to draw and few earlystage companies such as ours are competing for the available resources if we are unable to find the personnel and equipment that we need when we need them and at the prices that we have estimated today we might have to revise or postpone our plans   recent corporate events on
