of that just completed  deals in  days avery hartmans nov   0 am 0 facebook linkedin twitter email print full tilt capital managing partner anthony pompliano full tilt capital three months ago anthony pompliano launched full tilt capital with one mission to build the best early stage fund in the world  so far he can at least claim to be one of the busiest funds  pompliano and his cofounder jason williams have completed  deals in  days a frenetic pace thats unusual in the world of venture capital investing many vc firms complete that many deals over the course of a year usually because they spend time sifting through hundreds of pitches and doing due diligence on a handful of startups before narrowing it down to those they want to invest in pompliano said that process is unnecessary for the kind of companies that full tilt is investing in  the due diligence that most venture capital firms do is on data that is not available because we’re so early he said there are plenty of investors that i know who do financial modeling and all this planning but when it’s a person and an idea what are you going to do do a background check on the person there’s nothing to do other than talking to them and understanding what they want to do and who this person is as a human  hour timetable full tilts average investment is about 0 per company and theyve invested in startups ranging from a service that lets you charter a bus for carpooling on demand to one that provides market intelligence for apps pompliano said theyve looked at about  deals since august and the only deals full tilt wont take on are international companies companies in sectors where he and williams have very little expertise and startups that dont have ambitions to be highgrowth companies pompliano spent a year as a facebook product manager worked on the growth team at snapchat founded his own startup and was a sergeant in the army williams founded a healthcare startup in the early s and runs a rubber waste management company now the pair lives about  minutes away from each other in north carolina  jason williams cofounder of full tilt capital full tilt capital my life goal was definitely not to be an investor pompliano says the firm is trying to take a new approach to venture capital pompliano and williams signed on several companies before they had ever raised money from limited partners and they typically spend only  hours considering a deal the only factors they consider are whether they believe in the founders themselves and the potential for their ideas a pulse on reality full tilt opts to stay far outside the silicon valley bubble — literally on the other side of the country — for a specific reason  i think we’re more grounded pompliano said i think we have a better pulse on reality when it comes to mass market trends and preferences because we’re outside of those echo chambers there’s no sand hill road in north carolina that’s not a shot at those guys but there is an element of everyone’s always trying to impress each other full tilt is often the first investor in a deal pompliano said and in a few cases have been the only investor he says being the only firm to invest in a startup doesnt bother him in fact hes proud of it  i have no problem telling other venture capitalists if they’re waiting for social proof of other investors in they should get out of the business because they have no conviction and no courage pompliano said  pompliano thinks the fund is  probably the most active venture fund up to this point  and said full tilt has no plans to slow down the pace at which theyre doing deals  there are investment funds and firms that try to pick the winners he said in our eyes it’s more about building the companies  as we become more efficient and more decisive i think that we will only go faster get the latest snap stock price here see also this exgooglers startup is powered by emissaries who provide insight into their former employers now

will always question or dismiss the things they do not understand full tilt capitals managing partner explains why in a progress report detailing the firms accomplishments so far editor’s note last year a raleigh entrepreneur and former product  growth team manager at facebook started an earlystage venture firm setting out to “democratize access to opportunity for thousands of underserved founders” anthony “pomp” pompliano along with partners jason williams and chris hare molded full tilt capital around a strategy to defy the norms of how vc investments are traditionally made full tilt began by testing new more substantial models to supporting startups throwing out the returnbased approach to investing and reshaping the way vcs hearrespond to company pitches in the first place  nine months since launch and many investments later pompliano shares how that strategy has come to life at full tilt and what that means for earlystage companies this post was originally published on medium full tilt capital overview  months since launch  investments all still operational with significant runway  deployed lps we have never taken more than 0 check from anyone have no institutional backers and more than  percent have md phd or have an exit for 0 million or more our portfolio has  female founder teams  percent we have had one acquisition x return in less than 0 days there are

lowercase canaan partners mark cuban marc benioff ashton kutcher pierre omidyar maveron flybridge john maloney mike gorman backstage capital among many other great investors who are we and how did we do this full tilt capital is an early stage venture capital fund based in raleigh north carolina our goal is to build the best early stage investment firm in the world in order to do this we believe we need to  do something different than everyone else and  be “right” with this different strategy our goal is ambitious but as we tell our founders ambition is never discouraged here so what are we doing differently before launching full tilt we identified three aspects of venture capital that were held sacred by the incumbents deal economics investment decision process and portfolio company support we decided to intentionally do the opposite of the incumbents in these three areas do something different and now time will tell if we’re correct or not — — — deal economics it is our belief that most early stage venture capitalists have forgotten they are in the business of company building instead they spend their time trying to financially engineer returns these investors take the approach of making concentrated bets small number of deals with large check sizes which is built on their selftrust that they’re able to accurately select “winners” at the earliest stages as former founders we fundamentally disagree with this approach to investing we’re not interested in financially engineering returns — it feels like an unnecessary shortcut at best and a recipe for failure at worst historical venture return data reassured us that our initial gut feeling was correct the data shows that investors are more lucky than they are smart the only correlation to outsized returns is if an investor is  in the best deals and  in those deals early the traditional focus on importance in check size follow on decisions and terms is unsupported by the data over numerous economic cycles to be clear we’re not saying these decisions don’t matter at all but we do believe that they’re drastically less important than most investors are willing to accept our belief in this binaryoutcome based model led us to the foundation of full tilt’s strategy we invest 0 — 0 for  percent of a business with a goal of building a portfolio of 0 companies in less than  months this portfolio is industry and location agnostic there is no capital allocated for followon investments and we encourage founders to avoid predatory investment terms ratchets warrants liquidation preferences board seats etc at the earliest stages — — — investment decision process investors who are trying to financially engineer returns will become interested in a vertical conduct competitive analysis across the vertical select a small group of companies to due diligence and decide to invest in the company that they believe will be the vertical’s “winner” this would be a great strategy if venture capitalists  were as intelligent as they claim  evaluated opportunities with a perfect set of information and  were able to completely remove the human bias that we are all victim to at full tilt capital we believe this decision making framework is flawed we accept that  we’re not intelligent but rather have high eq  we never have a perfect set of information when evaluating an investment opportunity and  we have a high level of human bias that we will never be able to remove admitting these three points was the first step to creating an investment decision process that fits our investing strategy this means that since we invest differently we also make decisions differently in an ideal scenario a founder reaches out directly to us not through introduction and is able to efficiently describe  who they are  what they are working on and  how we can be helpful outside of the capital this introduction can occur via email linkedin twitter dm etc next we schedule a 0–0 minute phone call with no more than one potential follow up call we really like to avoid meeting the founder in person before making a decision because it removes the human bias of physical appearance  of our  investments we had never met in person before investing lastly our investment decision process is based on two things  people and  speed people are important because the founders are likely to be the only constant in the chaotic everchanging startup maturation cycle this “peoplefirst” focus is not shockingly different on the surface but we don’t focus on the traditional patterns education institution previous employment etc our focus on people is driven by a admittedly flawed process of identifying a founder’s ability to withstand stress synthesize complex amounts of inputs establish comfort in unpopular decisions and unnatural level of selfconfidence different than arrogance when we find these people we’re able to make decisions incredibly fast point  was speed we have made multiple investment decisions in under 0 minutes with very few decisions ever taking longer than  hours this desire of speed forces us to avoid the shiny thingsrabbit holes while empowering us to immediately drill into the mission critical aspects of a business or founder when we say “no bullshit approach” we mean it — — — portfolio company support incumbent investors love to tout how helpful they will be once they invest in a company we believe there is an inverse relationship between how helpful an investor claims they will be and how helpful they actually are this is not necessarily the investor’s fault but merely a rational outcome given the position these investors are put in the best investors know that they are selling a product capital and advice in an inefficient market the issue is most investors are not good salespeople so they end up reverting to begging founders to believe that  they have the capital and  they can be helpful every great founder knows that this sales pitch is less substance and more of a halfhearted attempt to convince the founder to say “yes” the traditional vc sales pitch is the equivalent of a software company saying “we are the greatest software company ever we have given our software to many other great companies like yours these other companies like us because we solved all their problems with our software” anyone who has been around the block knows that these sales pitches  are bullshit  are built on a flawed logic of repeating historical performance and  lack any level of focus or measurability at full tilt capital we believe our foundation of future success is built on the incomparable level of portfolio company support we provide within a highly defined space and timeline we would be lying if we claimed that we could help startups with everything and anything so we never claim that our simple focus is on “creating a significant measurable inflection point within  days postinvestment that changes the value of the company” that’s it no shiny toys no bullshit just a simple statement that we ruthlessly focus on executing towards it would take an entirely different article to describe the details of how we create these inflection points so i may do that at a future date in the meantime it is worth noting that our strategy is working we have companies that x’d their user base in  days x’d revenue in  days and even a company that x’d their valuation in  days point blank we’re experts at moving the needle on a company’s most important metrics — — — it has been a little uncomfortable and weird to share this level of detail about full tilt capital most venture capitalists actively work to keep their lps progress and returns behind the curtain of the general public since we’re doing so many things differently at full tilt we figured it would be interesting and fun to share these details along the way the early signs are encouraging but we have a long way to go it’s safe to say that we won’t know how good we are as venture capitalists for another five to seven years while this may sound like a long period of time we actively try to look at everything through a 0 year lens imagine what we can do if we go full tilt for a century… anthony pompliano anthony pomp pompliano is an entrepreneur and venture capitalist he is currently managing partner at full tilt capital one of the most active early stage venture
