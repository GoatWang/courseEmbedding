is based on my own experience and opinions date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from have many of these switches and they are a great switch easy to config plenty of features never seen one fail yet i can not recommend them enough to someone who is looking for a solid stable network they cost a bit more than most but they have the horse power to provide a stable core to your network date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from in my opinion a very large improvement over the early  series the addition of hot swap replaceable power supplies and easily replaceable fans which seemed to be the biggest problems with the  series my only gripe was originally when these switches first came out the support for stacking up to  switches was not there that is no longer an issue as it was resolved a few months after the initial release the addition of a dedicated management interface im sure has its place as well the ability to manage the switch via usb is nice also as most new laptops no longer have an integrated serial portmy only current issue was that i like to use a usb thumb drive to initially flash my ios and sometimes it seems to randomly disconnect for no apparent reasonall in all a great product date published  rated  out of  by tommy nguyen from cisco  ether switches can be a one stop and doitall product for a huge enterprise valuable featuresthe blade module feature which provide the scalability for site expansionimprovements to my organizationa cisco network structure consisted of  layers core distribution amp access we used the fwsm firewall services module to route the traffic and as a gateway to get to the wan as a result we were able to collapse the core layer into the distribution layer with a few blade modules fwsm sup amp ethernetroom for improvementa foe module would be imminent in the future this module can communicate with storage devices and esxi servers hba fiber connection via fibre channel switches brocade or cisco mds this can provide a cost effective method in a data center environment without upgrading to a more advanced cisco nexus core switchuse of solution yearsdeployment issuesthe power supply requires certain sockets and ups uninterruptible power supply each device should require a designated ups for it the ups should not be shared with other devices an improper termination of the switchs power supply cased a power surge

further alongcustomer servicegreat but cisco outsources its customer support services to india since most of our issues and outages occurred after hours some support technicians have a heavy indian

request has been denied canadian supreme court justice ronald mckinnon who oversaw the extradition hearing commented on the arrest saying it is simply not done in a civilized jurisdiction that is bound by the rule of law he also stated that the real reason for the extradition proceedings was because alfredadekeye dared to take on a multinational giant judge mckinnon has also condemned the us prosecutor for hiding the fact that alfredadekeye was in legal proceedings against cisco systems for stating that alfredadekeye had left the usa in a time period when he had not and a formal request for extradition was not filed against alfredadekeye when he was taken into custody he described the information provided by cisco and the us prosecutor as full of innuendo halftruths and falsehoods adding that this speaks volumes for ciscos duplicity and accused them of unmitigated gall in using such a heavyhanded move as an unsupportable arrest and jailing to pressure alfredadekeye to drop or settle his civil antitrust complaint this case was eventually settled out of court and dismissed with prejudice in february  in march  multiven filed a complaint both in switzerland and the us

out of  by anonymous from have many of these switches and they are a great switch easy to config plenty of features never seen one fail yet i can not recommend them enough to someone who is looking for a solid stable network they cost a bit more than most but they have the horse power to provide a stable core to your network date published  rated  out of  by anonymous from in my opinion a very large improvement over the early  series the addition of hot swap replaceable power supplies and easily replaceable fans which seemed to be the biggest problems with the  series my only gripe was originally when these switches first came out the support for stacking up to  switches was not there that is no longer an issue as it was resolved a few months after the initial release the addition of a dedicated management interface im sure has its place as well the ability to manage the switch via usb is nice also as most new laptops no longer have an integrated serial portmy only current issue was that i like to use a usb thumb drive to initially flash my ios and sometimes it seems to randomly disconnect for no apparent reasonall in all a great product date published  rated  out of

expansionimprovements to my organizationa cisco network structure consisted of  layers core distribution amp access we used the fwsm firewall services module to route the traffic and as a gateway to

future this module can communicate with storage devices and esxi servers hba fiber connection via fibre channel switches brocade or cisco mds this can provide a cost effective method in a data center environment without upgrading to a more advanced cisco nexus core switchuse of solution yearsdeployment issuesthe power supply requires certain sockets and ups uninterruptible power supply each device

cisco outsources its customer support services to india since most of our issues and outages occurred after hours some support technicians have a heavy indian accent which led to difficult
