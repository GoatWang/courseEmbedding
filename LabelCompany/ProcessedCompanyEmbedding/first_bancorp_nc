greensboro bankfirst bancorp has  branches in the triad and  in north carolina it increases its total assets to  billion and deposits to  billion“we’re an yearold bank that’s the fifth largest based in north carolina” richard moore first bancorp’s chief executive and former state treasurer said in july“we’ve had a small presence in the southern triad but knew our future would be tied to having a bigger presence in the parts of the state growing the fastest“our goal the past three years is to make that happen and winstonsalem will play a key role as part of the most natural expansion we can make right now “ moore saidfollowing the closing date carolina shareholders will be mailed an election form with instructions and a deadline for electing how they wish to be compensated in terms of

earnings per share “first bancorp is executing on its new goal of entering higher growth markets and enhance longerterm return on assets” marinac saidmoore said first bancorp has two main advantages over those supercommunity bank competitors two of which — bnc bancorp and yadkin financial corp — are in the process of being bought by regional banksthe first moore said is its focus on traditional community bank lending to individuals and small to mediumsized businesses in the  million to  million sweet spotthe second is that unlike bnc capital and yadkin first bancorp has no privateequity groups with a large ownership stake the other banks sold such stakes as part of surviving the financial crisis of  and rashes of defaulting residential mortgages and commercial realestate loans“we understand the triad economy the changes it’s going through” moore said“we are absolutely confident there is a place for a bank like ours with the economies of scale we have because traditionally
