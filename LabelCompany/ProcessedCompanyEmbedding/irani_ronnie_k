ronnie irani the american dream began while he was growing up in india with words and images of the wild west when he arrived in oklahoma he became enamored with another american standard — the oil and natural gas industry — and he never looked back now he is president of his own company rki exploration  production and is an active advocate for the industry in india and oklahomaheres an edited transcript from a recent conversation with the oklahomanq what brought you to oklahomaa during my fifth or sixth grade in school i got introduced to western novels and movies and i got hooked those were my early impressions of america — bold and vast — and i dreamed of coming here after completing my undergraduate degree from university of bombay in  i decided to come to the university of oklahoma to further my studies my older brother barry had come to ou to study petroleum engineering and his letters home made a strong impression on meq what has kept you in oklahoma for more than  yearsa my wife shahnaaz and i decided a long time ago that oklahoma is home for us we have two wonderful daughters who were born and grew up here i am grateful to oklahoma for my success here in america and want to help other students realize their dreams i spend a lot of time on ou campus helping in the petroleum engineering school business college and the international student programs through the ronnie irani student endowment fund we help students in areas of scholarship mentoring and leadership last year the mewbourne school of petroleum and geological engineering at ou established a relationship with a petroleum university in india and brought  students to spend one month on campus taking classes and interacting with our local industry this has now become an annual event and im glad to be a part of itq what attracted you to the oil and gas businessa life in an independent oil and gas company is adventurous and fun lots of imagination and creativity you can engage in the entire process from coming up with the geological and exploration concept to getting the well drilled to marketing the product with modern cuttingedge technology in understanding rocks and fluid flow  feet plus below the surface drilling horizontally at similar depths and completing wells in this new world of resource plays in shales is fascinatingq why did you opt to start your own company rather than work for an established producera ive had a successful career in corporate america all of it right here in oklahoma my past  years in the oil and natural gas industry have been tremendous this is an amazing industry with amazing people working in it if youre creative can take some risk and are willing to work hard there can be no limit to your success i wanted to take another shot at growing a company this time from grass rootsq youve been active in oerb for some time why do you feel that is importanta the oerb a brainchild of some of our oklahoma independent petroleum association leaders  years ago is a tremendously successful program it is one of my great passions because we do some much for education and the environment in oklahoma it is the only program that reaches students from kindergarten all the way through college the tools and funding the oerb provides for education and cleaning up abandoned and orphaned well sites throughout oklahoma — all thanks to the oil and natural gas industry — is unmatched by any other industry some teachers in the state wouldnt have science curriculum were it not for oerb programs and with our college scholarships and petro tech program we are also helping secure the energy future of this great country by making sure qualified workers will be ready to fill the jobs as they open around the state and
