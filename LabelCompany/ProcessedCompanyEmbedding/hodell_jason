history dates back to the revolutionary war when both sides realized the strategic importance of the commanding plateau on the west bank of the hudson river general george washington considered west point to be the most important strategic position in america washington personally selected thaddeus kosciuszko one of the heroes of saratoga to design the fortifications for west point in  and washington transferred his headquarters to west point in  continental soldiers built forts batteries and redoubts and extended a 0ton iron chain across the hudson to control river traffic fortress west point was never captured by the british despite benedict arnolds treason west point is the oldest continuously occupied military post in america several soldiers and legislators including washington knox hamilton and john adams desiring to eliminate americas wartime reliance on foreign engineers and artillerists urged the creation of an institution devoted to the arts and sciences of warfare president thomas jefferson signed legislation establishing the united states military academy in  he took this action after ensuring that those attending the academy would be representative of a democratic society colonel sylvanus thayer the father of the military academy served as superintendent from l he upgraded academic standards instilled military discipline and emphasized honorable conduct aware of our young nations need for engineers thayer made civil engineering the foundation of the curriculum for the first half century usma graduates were largely responsible for the construction of the bulk of the nations initial railway lines bridges harbors and roads after gaining experience and national recognition during the mexican and indian wars west point graduates dominated the highest ranks on both sides during the civil war academy graduates headed by generals such as grant lee sherman and jackson set high standards of military leadership for both the north and south the development of other technical schools in the postcivil war period allowed west point to broaden its curriculum beyond a strict civil engineering focus following the creation of army postgraduate command and staff schools the military academy came to be viewed as the first step in a continuing army education in world war i academy graduates again distinguished themselves on the battlefield after the war superintendent douglas macarthur sought to diversify the academic curriculum in recognition of the intense physical demands of modern warfare macarthur pushed for major changes in the physical fitness and intramural athletic programs every cadet an athlete became an important goal additionally the cadet management of the honor system long an unofficial tradition was formalized with the creation of the cadet honor committee eisenhower macarthur bradley arnold clark patton stilwell and wainwright were among an impressive array of academy graduates who met the challenge of leadership in the second world war the postwar period again saw sweeping revisions to the west point curriculum resulting from the dramatic developments in science and technology the increasing need to understand other cultures and the rising level of general education in the army in  president johnson signed legislation increasing the strength of the corps of cadets from  to  more recently reduced to 0 to keep up with the growth of the corps a major expansion of facilities began shortly thereafter another significant development at west point came when enrollment was opened to women in  sixtytwo women graduated in the class of  to include andrea hollen rhodes scholar just as women are a vital and integral part of the us army so they are at west point in recent

by email jason hodell eight years ago in may at the height of the dot com meltdown approximately  of the avp’s top players attended a meeting called by sports agent leonard armato at his digital media campus in el segundo the players included  beach volleyball olympic gold medalist karch kiraly and 0 beach volleyball olympic gold medalists eric fonoimoana and dane blanton the players met in armato’s personal office “there was plenty of room leonard has a big office” fonoimoana said following the meeting behind armato’s desk was a size  basketball shoe signed by his client shaquille o’neal armato announced he was buying the avp tour which he had been executive director of from  until 0 when it was playerowned he had left when the players rejected his demand for equity to become one of professional sports’ top agents in a tone that was part pep talk part hardball armato outlined his vision for the future of the avp players would be guaranteed  million in prize money for an eightstop tour beginning the following month with the mervyn’s beach bash in hermosa beach the men’s and women’s pro tours would be combined for the first time to give the tour mass market appeal international rules with its larger ball smaller court and rally scoring would be adopted traditional side out scoring was too slow for tv the players’ jobs wouldn’t end when they left the court they would be salespeople as well as athletes all players from journeymen to olympians would work under identical contracts armato ended the one and a half hour meeting by advising the players they had until noon the following friday to sign the contract underscoring the players’ limited options was the presence of spencer segura of spencer trask the new york investment company that had bought the avp out of bankruptcy in  segura encouraged the players to embrace armato’s proposal despite grumbling that he was bastardizing the game by friday’s deadline 0 avp players had signed on armato promised them one day they would be playing in fanpacked beach volleyball stadiums last week under circumstances both distressingly similar and hopefully different avp players were again asked to sign new contracts drafted by a new ceo jason hodell confronted by a new tanking economy the players have been without a contract since last year “we’ve all been humbled by the terrible state the sport is in we keep getting thrown smaller lifeboats but to a drowning person a small lifeboat looks good” hermosa beach open winner canyon ceman who has economics and sociology degrees from stanford observed in  last week ceman now retired from the tour and a consultant for the avp gave a more nuanced assessment of the avp and its new head leader “it’s not an easy business it has costs other sports don’t have like building temporary stadiums and dealing with the california coastal commission and it lacks traditional revenue sources like fully paid admission “but my impression of jason has been very positive he’s a west point and wharton graduate and has business turnaround experience which seems appropriate for the avp “and he’s approaching the task of improving the avp with humility and a focus on costs and operation efficiencies which has been lacking in the past” ceman said in contrast to the autocratic armato who denies having been the inspiration for movie super agent jerry mcguire hodell prefers the term player partnership to player contract palace coup following armato’s sudden resignation at an avp board meeting in april players generously praised him for building the tour from six tournaments in  to  in  and quadrupling the prize money “leonard was a great asset in terms of growing the tour’s revenue and position in the very complicated world of minor sports and we’re all appreciative of him for that” canyon said but that appreciation didn’t allay concerns about their paychecks last year despite  million in revenue avp lost over  million it was never profitable under armato’s entrepreneurialstyle stewardship hodell 0 arrived well prepared to transition the avp to what he describes as a sustainable business model like armato the foot hodell was a passionate and modestly successful volleyball player he grew up playing club volleyball in virginia and was an outside hitter at west point during five years as an infantry ranger in hawaii he worked on his twoman game at outrigger beach the birthplace of beach volleyball the beach was home court for university of hawaii players including included future avp standouts kevin wong and sean scott scott now a redondo beach resident and teammate john hayden defeated  olympic gold medalists todd rodgers and phil dalhausser at the avp open in atlanta three weeks ago on leaving the army in  hodell obtained an mba in economics at the university of pennsylvania’s wharton school of business and then joined jp morgan where he helped turn around a troubled 0 million web hosting company presciently named digex when verizon acquired digex for  million in  hodell used his proceeds from the transaction to found plainview capital investments hodell continued playing competitive volleyball including avp qualifiers on both coasts until two years ago his top two avp finishes he readily acknowledges were ths “i just scratched the surface of playing at the avp level” he said but in finance circles that qualified him as a volleyball expert and led to an invitation last may to join the avp board from amtrust capital management a major avp shareholder amtrust’s concerns about armato’s management traced back to armato’s attempt to sell the avp in april  to shamrock holdings headed by roy disney walt disney’s nephew armato had taken the avp public shortly after the  athens olympics when the tour’s popularity received a big boost from kerry walsh’s and misty maytreanor’s gold medal performance fellow avp players holly mcpeak who is armato’s wife and her teammate elaine youngs won bronze shamrock’s  million offer included roughly  million for armato and a fiveyear contract at 00 a year amtrust and other major shareholders blocked the deal on the grounds that it was  percent below the avp’s stock value and was “flawed by clear conflicts of interest” last december when the avp was voluntarily delisted its stock had fallen to less than  cents a share settling in hodell moved to manhattan beach from annapolis maryland last summer with his wife adrienne and children graham  and rowan  his first assignment was the audit committee he said during a recent interview at the avp’s ninth floor offices in the howard hughes center recognition that the avp would run out of money before the end of  led hodell to focus on a search for new investors “armato and i team pitched a lot of people one of the companies was rjsm whose managing director nick lewin was a friend of one of my analysts at plainview capital” hodell said armato and hodell invited lewin and his associates to avp tournaments at miami chicago coney island and manhattan beach “lewin saw the potential and was excited he still is” hodell said in september  rjms invested  million just enough to cover avp anticipated shortfall a condition of rjsm’s funding was that hodell be appointed chief financial and chief operating officer armato’s departure in april while described by the avp as a resignation coincided with negotiations for a new round of funding from rjsm following the meeting lewin announced his company would increase its investment in exchange for 0 to 0 percent control of the tour hodell praised armato to reporters as “a devoted and tireless visionary who took the sport to new heights there was just a difference of opinion on how to move forward with the property” armato declined to comment about his departure saying he preferred to end his legacy on a positive note “it was a great run it’s a sport i love and i look forward to my next challenge whatever that will be” he told reporters moving out olympic gold medalist eric fonoimoana met with hodell last year shortly after he was named coo and cfo following the 0 olympics in sydney fonoimoana established dig for kids the charity enlists avp players to coach inner city kids in volleyball and academics its fundraisers where supporters mingle freely with the towering strikingly attractive avp men and women are highlights of the beach society calendar fonoimoana wanted hodell to expand the avp’s partnership with dig for kids then speaking to a broader issue he urged hodell to expand the avp’s outreach not only to the local inner city but to future players and fans nationwide not for charitable reasons he argued but for the tour’s own survival avp men’s teams have won gold at three of the four summer olympics since beach volleyball was introduced in  kerri walsh and misty maytreanor won gold at two of those four olympics two of the eight gold medalists fonoimoana and walsh are hermosa beach residents  silver medalist mike dodd and  bronze medalist holly mcpeak are from manhattan beach but the avp’s level of dominance cannot be sustained by a development program that consists largely of beach pickup games at th street in hermosa marine street in manhattan beach and half a dozen other southern california beach communities fonoimoana told hodell “we won those medals because we happened to have great athletes those years and not because of any development system” fonoimoana said in an interview last week beach volleyball’s development has been stunted he also told hodell by the avp’s lack of cooperation with other governing bodies in particular the fivb to the distress of the avp the lausanne swissbased international league was allowed by the united states association of volleyball usav to pick the beach volleyball teams that represented the us in all four olympics the conflict between the rival leagues resulted in fonoimoana himself being suspended by the avp the year after he won gold in sydney for skipping an avp tournament in muskegon to play in an fivb olympic qualifier in italy mark paaluhi one of the area’s most promising players was permanently banned from the avp that same year for playing in a minor king of the beach tournament he recently appealed to hodell who lifted the ban free ball this year two sea changes in the sport occurred that opened the door to greater cooperation among beach and indoor volleyball organizations the fivb has relinquished responsibility for naming us beach volleyball olympic teams and the ncaa has made beach volleyball a sanctioned women’s sport henceforth to be known as “sand” volleyball in deference to beachchallenged campuses the  collegiate beach volleyball championship was played in a sand court stadium trucked to the riverside civic center by the avp for april’s riverside open the championship was won by hermosa beach’s jupiter alex and her usc teammate jessica gysin the fivb’s departure promises the avp a greater say in the us olympic team selections providing it can work cooperatively with the usav the usac has long neglected beach volleyball in favor of the six player indoor game but that is expected to change with the arrival of first women’s and then men’s ncaa sand volleyball the prospect of beach volleyball college scholarships is also expected to encourage participation at the high school level which has an estimated 0 indoor players armato was mocked when he proposed beach volleyball stadiums in  one of his most notable missteps had been the  volleyball world championships at ucla’s la tennis center with nike as a sponsor armato brought the world’s best volleyball players together by negotiating a truce between the feuding avp and fivb but the event drew just 0 paid attendees prompting fivb president ruben agosta to declare that if the world championship ever returned to los angeles “i would go to manhattan beach” the  avpfivb tournament at the home depot center tennis stadium in carson was similarly unsuccessful despite being the final qualifier for the  athens olympics but with beach volleyball becoming a college sport armato’s vision of beach volleyball stadiums dotting the country suddenly becomes less fanciful if it happens the stadiums could save the avp the millions it now spends annually trucking stadium scaffolding and  tons of sand around the country an officer and a gentleman hodell described his plainview capital investments as predicated on “cash flow drive” his plans for the avp are based on a similar analysis “leonard built a beautiful brand over a course of eight years and to do that required heavy investment in marketing media and a big operational footprint…my task was to come in and analyze the business we worked very hard at developing a different operating model “we rightsized the operational footprint and scaled back the media cutting  million out of costs the stadiums we set up in hermosa manhattan and atlanta last year cost 00 this year in atlanta we cut the stadium cost 00 by eliminating some corner and vip seating and we sold more tickets” he said “it sounds overly simplistic but the key to any successful business is taking care of your products and your customers” he said “at the avp the product is the players and the game there’s been a level of playermanagement discord at the avp over the past few years” one of the most contested areas between players and management has been sponsorship kerri walsh’s sponsor speedo could not have been happy with the nike swash on her suit top when she won the gold medal in beijing nike paid the olympic committee to be the exclusive uniform sponsor trumping walsh’s personal sponsorship under armato players could be forced to relinquish sponsorships from companies that competed with newly signed avp sponsors “the issue needed to be simplified and we wanted to give the players more flexibility to market themselves” hodell said “so we came up with a simple rule if we sign a major tour sponsor players can’t sign competing sponsors however if kerri already signed speedo and later we sign nike she’s grandfathered in and we need to be straight about that with sponsors we are trying to sign” walsh’s agent ryan morgan described the new player agreement hodell drafted and is now under review as “generally more polished and more favorable toward players” “obviously a balance needs to be struck if a great sponsorship deal benefits the tour sure closing a category can be good for everyone the problem is always in the detail for example if a tour sponsorship doesn’t accrue to the benefit of all the players” hodell has also addressed prize money issues with what he describes as “revenue sharing for the players that scales with the business” fonoimoana recalled showing up at tournaments not knowing what the prize money would be “at least from what i’ve seen in the emails jason appears to have improved basic communications” fonoimoana said prize money will be a fixed percent of revenue regardless of profits and will increase as profits increase hodell said this year’s prize money for  tournaments will be  million down from  and  tournaments last year “revenue sharing is a way of making the players feel they have some skin in the game” hodell said morgan whose clients in addition to walsh include men’s olympic gold medalists todd rogers and phil dalhausser said he isn’t troubled by his clients being asked to sign the same contracts as lesser players “it works out because the differentiation works out at the sponsorship and prize money levels” he explained new economics there is a growing academic interest in behavioral economics which hodell probably didn’t study at west point or wharton but seems to have an instinctive understanding of at the huntington beach open last month hodell saw packed outside courts which are free and empty paid seating around the stadium courts three weeks later the avp announced it would discount admission tickets 0 tickets were reduced to 0 on weekends and made free on fridays the first 0 people to buy weekend passes at the hermosa and manhattan opens will qualify for a meet and greet with olympian dalhausser tickets are particularly price sensitive in a depressed economy but more importantly sponsors are particularly crowd sensitive and sponsor money accounts for over 0 percent of avp’s revenue tv doesn’t like empty seats either and nbc is broadcasting this summer’s hermosa beach coney island and chicago tournaments nbc will broadcast the women’s finals on saturday and the men’s on sunday the semi finals will be broadcast live on universal sports an nbc cable affiliate the manhattan open popularly known as the wimbledon of beach volleyball may not be televised for the first time in years “because of scheduling conflicts” hodell said in other efforts to build avp’s audience hodell has reached out to internet audiences with a fantasy league and live streaming coverage of all tournaments the fantasy league teams require selection of a b and c players which helps lower ranked players attract fans the avp also plans to launch a social networking site within the next six months that will be the “facebook of volleyball” hodell said to increase participation in the sport avp players will coach fourday kids camps the weeks prior to major events including the manhattan beach and hermosa beach opens player albert hanneman the president of fonoimoana’s dig for kids is the camp director the tour has also enlisted barefoot wine’s sponsorship of  amateur tournaments across the country top finishers will receive all expense paid trips to san francisco on august  and compete in that weekend’s avp tournament january through march four member men’s and women’s teams will bring beach volleyball and  tons of sand to midsize snowbound cities cutting through the clutter to improve the revenue side of the equation hodell acknowledged he needs to “stop the bleeding on the sponsor side” prominent  avp sponsors include crocs bud light kfc russell athletics gatorade and malibu rum but gone from last year taking  percent of the tour’s revenue with them are jose cuervo hilton nautica mcdonalds pny technology and banana boat “it’s very difficult to line up sponsors but we have some pretty basic categories open including sun screen health and beauty water and airlines and hotels” he said because of the poor economy all sports are suffering from declining sponsorship dollars general motors cut  million from its us olympic team funding scaled back its nascar sponsorship and even dropped tiger woods as a spokesman for buick the los angeles times recently reported arena football’s decadeold los angeles avengers and major league lacrosse’s twoyearold los angeles riptide both went under this year even in good times and despite millions of amateur players minor professional sports such as tennis soccer track lacrosse and every professional woman’s sport struggle financially but hodell contends beach volleyball is unique among minor sports what others might view as its biggest handicap – the fact that most of the country doesn’t have a beach — hodell views as its greatest asset “no one else looks like the avp on tv we have olympic level athletes playing a world class lifestyle sport on the beach that’s our special niche our competitive edge “the avp is not profitable now but if we hold costs down and close several big sponsors – a visa or a red bull – and if we execute flawlessly the economic model turns around quickly” he said comments comments so far comments posted to easyreadernewscom may be reprinted in the easy reader print edition which is published each thursday by kevin cody kevin is the publisher
