as a brokerdealer since  and maintains its headquarters in oaks pennsylvania sidco is a whollyowned subsidiary of sei for the fiscal year ended december   sidco reported net income of approximately  million  sei investments company is a pennsylvania corporation with its headquarters in oaks pennsylvania sei is not registered with the commission as a brokerdealer or investment adviser sei investments management corporation a whollyowned subsidiary of sei is an investment adviser registered with the commission sei through its whollyowned subsidiaries administers  billion in mutual fund and pooled assets manages almost  billion in assets and processes almost  trillion of investment transactions annually seis common stock is registered with the commission pursuant to section g of the exchange act and is listed on the nasdaq national market and trades under the symbol seic background  this matter involves violations by seis whollyowned subsidiary sidco of the net capital customer protection reporting and books and records provisions of the exchange act and seis causing of sidcos violations  sidco acts as both an introducing broker distributing shares in various mutual funds and formerly acted as an intermediary broker between institutional clients and government securities dealers in repurchase agreement transactions in its role as an intermediary broker sidco has custody of customer funds and securities sidco has a commission recapturerebate program where customers are rebated a portion of their commission dollars sidco also provides directed brokerage services which allows it to pay a portion of customers expenses out of commission monies  in august  the nasd conducted a routine examination of sidco finding that its books and records were incomplete and its net capital computations were inaccurate in particular the nasd identified issues relating to an account for the exclusive benefit of customers established under rule cki of the exchange act including the commingling of customer funds and sidcos failure to include this account in its financial records as well as sidcos failure to include certain error accounts in its books and records at that time sidco informed the nasd that it would correct these problems in fact it did not  in april  the staff conducted a cause examination of sidcos directed brokerage and commission rebate programs the staff concluded that sidco had not remedied the problems previously noted by the nasd and many of the problems including the commingling of customer funds remained  the examiners concluded that sidco incorrectly had calculated and reported its net capital from at least september  through february  in particular sidcos failure to reflect a balance of over  million in an account established under rule cki used for sidcos repurchase agreement program the ki account as both an allowable asset and as an aggregate indebtedness liability at month end february   resulted in an increase in sidcos minimum required net capital of  which caused the company to fall below its  minimum net capital requirement for that month sidco failed to timely notify the commission of this net capital deficiency as required by rule ac of the exchange act  in addition for the year ended december   sidco reported net capital of more than  million when based upon its books and records at that time it should have reported negative net capital of  million this net capital deficiency was largely due to an overdraft of approximately  million that occurred on december   as a result of a transaction in the ki account by sei investments management corporation simco through its activities as transfer agent for sei mutual funds and certain nonsei mutual funds  this simcorelated transaction in sidcos ki account resulted from the fact that the account was being used for cash movements in connection with both sidco and simco transactions this commingling of customers funds with funds belonging to shareholders of the various mutual funds resulted in sidcos failure to maintain its exemption from the provisions of rule c under paragraph ki of the rule  sidco failed to make and keep current accurate books and records reflecting all assets and liabilities from at least september  through february  specifically sidco failed to include several accounts in its books and records and conversely erroneously included accounts in its books and records that did not belong to sidco but rather to seis transfer agent the accounts not included in sidcos records consisted of two accounts for the exclusive benefit of customers under rule cki at least eleven error accounts and at least eight clearing accounts the accounts erroneously included on sidcos books and records included two accounts in its general ledger that belonged to simco sidco did not notify the commission of its failure to make and keep current books and records as required by rule ad of the exchange act  as a result of its failure to accurately reflect all assets and liabilities on its books and records sidco materially misstated its net capital in certain monthly focus reports filed with the commission from at least september  through february   by omitting the ki account from its financial records sidco materially misstated its audited financial statements for the year ended december   sidco reported positive net worth of more than  million and net capital of more than  million when based upon its books and records at that time it should have reported a negative net worth of approximately  million and negative net capital of over  million sidco failed to file a rule a notification letter as required by rule ab of the exchange act to report this net capital deficiency which has since been eliminated  in addition in its audited financial statements for the year ended december   sidco incorrectly reported that it had maintained its exemption from the provisions of rule c  as sidcos parent company sei was ultimately responsible for the reliability and completeness of sidcos books and records sei effectively controlled sidcos functions and activities sidco shared seis clients and facilities and even some of seis officers these officers which included sidcos former chief financial officer and general counsel also held positions at sei in addition sidcos former board consisted solely of individuals who were also officers and directors of sei despite this overlapping of directors and officers and apparent control exerted by sei over sidco the staff found that inadequate time and attention was devoted to the operations of sidco resulting in the violations discussed above  in particular little attention was given to sidcos books and records causing sidco to fail to include several accounts in its books and records and improperly including accounts in its books and records that belonged to simco one account which was not included in sidcos books and records or any books and records of any sei affiliated entity was the ki account in which customer funds were commingled with funds belonging to shareholders of various mutual funds  since the staffs examination sidco has taken corrective action on several fronts with respect to the financial and operations concerns the staff raised and continues to do so among the more significant steps taken sidco has hired a new president and a new financial and operations principal it has replaced its former general counsel and hired an adviser to the board and it has taken steps to formalize the boards functions including adding an independent director further as to the ki account sidco closed its repurchase agreement program as of october   in addition sidco has engaged deloitte  touche llp deloitte to address the financial and operational issues raised by the staff and to conduct a comprehensive review of sidcos operations including sidcos business activities and organizational structure as well as its record keeping and financial reporting processes in connection with this engagement sidco has undertaken a comprehensive review of its accounts to ensure that all accounts

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples

may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
