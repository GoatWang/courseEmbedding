leading developer of placentabased cell therapies recently announced that it has received notification from the us food and drug administration fda that its united states phase ii intermittent claudication ic study ind  has been placed on clinical hold due to a serious allergic reaction in a case which required hospitalizationout of  patients enrolled in pluristems trials to date this is the first case of a serious allergic event this event occurred in a patient with multiple diseases which may have influenced the severity of the event the patient was discharged from the hospital the following day following the resolution of all her symptomsthe fda will issue a letter within the next  days detailing a list of questions and requests for information from pluristem zami aberman pluristems chairman and ceo took time to answer questions about the companyq what do you mean by the word seriousaberman according to the fda a serious adverse event sae in human drug trials is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death is lifethreatening or requires inpatient hospitalizationq so did the patient have anaphylactic shockaberman the patient did not go into anaphylactic shock and her vital signs were stable from the time she was first seen by medical professionals and during her short hospitalizationq does this mean that most likely you have to run an additional safety study in us aberman no we will do the risk assessment based on the fdas questions investigate what happened and continue the phase ii study once the fda is satisfied with our responsesq what exactly is involved with a clinical hold does this affect any of your other trials aberman a clinical hold means that we will not recruit additional patients into the us study until the fda lifts the hold this does not affect the other trials namely our muscle injury trial or intermittent trial both in germanywhat are the principal goals of the ic study i have the clinicaltrialsgov description and what is the proposed timetable aberman the principal goals of the ic phase b dose escalation study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three different doses of our placental expanded plx cells in the treatment of intermittent claudication ic a subset of peripheral artery disease pad we anticipate that enrollment to the study will be completed during hq any thoughts on how the clinical hold might affect that timetable aberman we were notified by our regulator representative working with the fda about the clinical hold in the us due to a serious allergic reaction according the fda guidelines within  days we will receive written notification that will include all the questions and clarifications needed we have enjoyed an excellent working relationship with the fda for several years and have received valuable assistance on more than once occasion as we work together to make cell therapy a reality we will work continue to fully cooperation with the fda as we have in the past to resume the clinical trial we hope that in the upcoming weeks we will clarify with the fda all their issues in order to continue our trial in the us as planned hopefully there will be a minimal if at all influence on the trials timetableq given the extensive exclusion criteria and the fact that the company has not previously experienced a serious allergic event with plx any thoughts as to what the company will examine first in this case aberman the patient suffered from serious background diseases and was chronically oxygen dependent approximately  hours following the intramuscular treatment with our plx cells the patient noted a rash and experienced shortness of breath she was treated in the hospital and released approximately  hours after admission following the resolution of all her symptoms we are investigating to see if there are connections between her reaction and our treatmentq also what is the immediate impact if any of the clinical hold on the companys other development activities aberman the only trial effected by the hold is the plxpad phase ii intermittent claudication ic study and the cli study in the us there is no impact on the plxpad other clinical trials outside the us underway or planned at this timeread moreq finally is there any additional informationbackground that would help our readers understand the plx technology the ic study or the effect of the clinical holdaberman pluristems plx cells are mesenchymallike adherent stromal cells ascs derived from full term human placentas these cells are expanded in the companys proprietary bioreactor system that creates a threedimensional d microenvironment this d technology allows for the controlled largescale growth of cells implementing an optimized standardized scaledup and handsoff operation this allows plx cells to be massproduced with batchtobatch consistency in an effective and controllable process furthermore pluristems d expansion technology allows for the production of specific plx cell products for each of the companys targeted indicationshealthcare investors and biotech traders interested in accessing biomedreports new complete database of
