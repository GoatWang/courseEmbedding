triumph of new hollywood over old hollywood says showrunner youtubes amonth live tv streaming service is coming to  new cities tom rutledge the ceo of cable tv company charter communications told wall street this week he was surprised that  million of his  million customers dont want tv they just want broadband internet theyre actively not subscribing to tv in addition to the web our broadbandonly growth has been greater than i thought it would be he added rutledge is not alone a lot of people are having difficulty processing the idea that now its so easy to watch shows or movies online whenever you want that cable and broadcast tv just arent something that everybody wants anymore people thought that cordcutters were merely switching from cable tv to broadband internet they were keeping the pipes that come into their houses in other words and using them differently maybe they were still watching tv if tv came as a cheap bundle with internet its noteworthy that all the major cabletelco companies still have thriving hardwired telephone businesses too even though many people never use them — because they come with the bundle but recent subscriber stats show a net loss across all three services — tv web and phone we have a pet theory at business insider because its a lot easier now to survive on free wifi people who already cut the cable tv cord are now cutting all cords and living entirely off wifi that comes from businesses cities and campuses heres what rutledge said on his quarterly call with analysts he was asked by morgan stanley analyst benjamin swinburne do you think the pay tv penetration in that base is declining thomas m rutledge  chief executive officer president and director   i would say that the one thing that surprised me  has surprised me about charter is that our broadbandonly growth has been greater than i thought it would be and part of that i think is some change in the world that is going on with consumers but the bigger part of it is that charters video product was inferior and we had brand issues around that and so i think while you can see some of these trends occurring throughout the whole industry its more exaggerated at charter i think because of the way we let our video product deteriorate and weve turned that around and i see the  million broadbandonly customers as a real selling opportunity for us from a video perspective the wall street journal notes that charter had some specific issues that made its tv product worse than it needed to be so this may merely be an anecdote rather than a harbinger of the underlying trend but still if you were looking for the death of tv this is the kind of thing youd expect to see see also another  million people just ditched cable tv more death of tv television
