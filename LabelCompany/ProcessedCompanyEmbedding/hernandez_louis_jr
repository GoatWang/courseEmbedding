with avid technology inc ceo louis hernandez jrjim probascobenzingamay  reblogsharetweetshare“were trying to solve a bigger problem its not just an editor audio storage or marketing its actually the whole thing thats the business problem” avid technology inc nasdaq avid ceo louis hernandez jr explained to benzinga in part two of a twopart seriespreviously in part one hernandez talked about his plan to turn the former video and audio production technology giant around as it rejoined the nasdaq following its delisting in february in part two hernandez discusses avid everywhere the companys vision for the future of the media industrybz how is media production changing in the industrylh the creative side of the workflow is now fusing with the monetization side the unintended consequence is that content creation demand is going up but budgets are only going up slightlybudgets for technology are going up three times as much as budgets on content creation side budgets are shifting from creative professionals over to monetizingrelated link avid congratulates its customers on their achievementsbz what solutions to this problem does avid proposelh many of the steps to monetizing can be done during creation were trying to put all of those activities onto what we call the avid media central platformwe put together all the shared services you would have – anything youd like to do this is like ios on the iphone it is the underlying operating system upon which you can put applicationsbz how does the avid media central platform worklh search across your entire network means if you connect media composer adobe and apple this shared application service will allow you to search all your editorial suites for a piece of media regardless if its our application or somebody elsesfor specific tasks like resolution independence instead of having each application solve that problem for you any application that sits on top – whether it is adobes or ours – can use that capabilityinstead of forcing clients to connect all the pieces we allow application providers to connect directly to the operating system so their plugins always workwhen they upgrade – or we upgrade – well know whether the connection works ahead of timerelated link zebra technologies tops q expectationsbz how are applications organized on the platformlh applications are broken down into suites which share that common osadobe for example fits into the artists suite any application certified using the connectivity toolkit can sit on top of the avid media central platform osthe media suite consists of all the things you should do concurrently but most people do after they create the asset that includes metadata tagging protecting the asset asset management and so forthother suites include storage and marketplace using the marketplace for example you can invite people from there – using collaboration services – to work on a common sectionbz what about pricinglh in the past we didnt price our package in a way for the individual user to use easily now we doyou can now get the best avid priced and packaged in a way that is affordable if you can get the same product for the same price as adobe or an equivalent package but that won every major oscar and ace award why wouldnt youbz more specifically does pricing now include a subscription packagelh we recently launched subscription for media composer and came back and launched it for pro toolsthen we kind of shocked everyone under artist suite – first entry – these are going to be the first free versions of our artist suiterelated link the  benzinga fintech award winnersbz so users can now get entrylevel versions of avid applications freelh correct the first one we announced was pro tools its an entry point product but the same platform with some limitationseventually users can migrate up to month or outright ownership as neededbz how will the new avid platform address the educational communitylh avid is very strong in many of the traditional educational institutions because thats what is expected out in the real world anybody aspiring to be a professional is going to be taught on avidwhat we didnt have in the past was individual pricing for k or an individual school that may want to use itread morewe just entered into partnership with  different universities around the first product school systems will join because they can incorporate the most broadly used software in the world freerelated link avid enters into a definitive agreement to acquire orad hitec systems for eur per sharebz so in a way avid everywhere is also avid for everyone – at least in media productionlh weve started to recognize that there are three basic kinds of users theres the individual which we want to connect to the entire ecosystem there are creative teams and there are large media enterprisesavid media central platform is designed to allow all three kinds of users to interact and collaboratethats where

herndandez jr on the future of pro tools  sonicscoop     newsletter sign up meet the new ceo of avid qa with louis herndandez jr on the future of pro tools february th  by david weiss view as single page view as single page tweet there’s no official president of pro audio but the ceo who runs avid comes closest to holding that title just like the president of the united states is often referred to as the leader of the free world the person who runs the burlington mabased media technology company has responsibilities transcending their job description louis hernandez jr is the new ceo of avid when avid was founded in  there was nothing to suggest that it would become the steward of the world’s most ubiquitous audio hardwaresoftware systems at the time the company was a pioneering creator of nonlinear editing nle systems for film and tv editors – the sound business wasn’t even a twinkle in its eye as it built its digital video editing system media composer into its own category killer but when avid acquired digidesign in  audio quickly became a core competency as everyone knows digidesign’s pro tools system handily won the daw war and became the industry standard music production and editing system worldwide from recording studios to audio post its  purchase of sibelius built on its foundation within the segment via ownership of a top notation software solution in use by composers everywhere meanwhile the maudio line has come and gone from avid’s portfolio overseeing all of this as of monday february th  is a new ceo for avid louis hernandez jr his installment by the avid board stands as a welcome chance to begin a new era for the diversified media company which endured waves of layoffs and a steadily sinking stock price under their former ceo gary greenfield consumer confidence in the company has dipped in kind during greenfield’s fiveyearplus term as everything from poor customer relations to concerns about avid’s longterm prospects deeply disturbed its audio user base hernandez’ appointment just may provide pro tools customers everywhere with reason to hope however a longtime board member of avid hernandez became available when the company that he previously headed the financial technology provider open solutions was acquired this past january at a valuation of  billion while he may be good at generating value for stockholders hernandez understands there’s more at stake with his newfound duties a live music fan and aficionado of the likes of trombone shorty hernandez stresses early and often that he truly connects with the experience of sound as the new de facto president of pro audio he’s looking to facilitate the same for a lot of people far into the future our conversation with louis hernandez jr ceo of avid follows you joined avid’s board in  what attracted you to the company at the time a couple of things one of them is i’m a technologist i’ve been in technology and programming since i was a kid – my father taught computer science actually my educational background is in finance and economics what interested me about avid is that technology should bring humans closer together and bring more joy in this case someone has the idea of creating content for the enjoyment of another person and avid’s role lies somewhere in between there in trying to facilitate that i knew gary when he came onboard and i knew some of the board members it was a challenging time – a different time than today it was precrisis avid was doing some different things during that time we’ve tried to capture the energy that avid is known for and get closer to our customers we also had a product refresh cycle that we’ve been seeing the fruits of since it started  months ago economic activity should be the measure of your value to the community by that measure we haven’t added enough value to the community especially with what our really talented employees can do i want to rebuild that community based on how we define what they do bringing joy to the people that they are trying to reach that’s why i joined in  and this is where we’re at now what were the factors that led to the change of leadership at avid i think gary felt like he had worked pretty hard to get the company through the crisis continuing to spend on rd which is tough to do when there’s a lot of pressure he wanted to bring someone in with a history of growth in technology i knew a lot of the board members my company was going to be sold soon and because we’re friends it was a lot more collaborative transition than would normally be the case i also was familiar with the strategy i knew why we did what we did what worked and hadn’t and my friendship with gary made it smoother the impetus is to be more squarely focused on growth the reality is that our market is changing pretty dramatically so while focusing on the future and growth may sound like a romantic notion we’re humbled enough to know that the way people create and consume content today is very different and the value drivers are very different i think we’re in the best position to articulate the way you can connect humans with the idea of how they bring pleasure and joy to another person efficiently economically and to deliver the value it was intended to bring gary and the board wanted someone with that kind of experience tackling those issues in an industry in transition – someone who knows the technology and with a history of staying connected with communities and inspiring others that’s what we hope to do here founded in  avid has had its share of ups and downs how would you characterize gary greenfield’s approach to running avid in what ways will you stay the course and what do you expect to do differently gary as i said came in at a very different time so it’s hard to compare i think he tried to reestablish credible relationships with the clients — that will continue he tried to refresh the product suite – that will continue he also established a clear message that we’re focused on the professionals and their market and that will continue as well what will be different is we’ll spend more time focusing on changes in the market and making sure that avid reinforces its role as the thought leader i think we’re in the best position we created the product category we’re coming off a big investment cycle in rd we have rabid fans and people on the client and employee side are committed to winning together i’m focused on working with the energy of the community because the challenges are bigger than ever we want to create a vision of how we enable the most soughtafter content in a more powerful way and sustain the great joy of creating wonderful music and movies etc… we’re going to be much more focused on that rather than realigning products or achieving cost cuts it’s a different time for avid this is what i do and this is why the board asked me to join how do you view the opportunities and challenges that characterize the audio portion of avid’s market today specifically audio has a long history of lifting the spirits of humans since it’s been recorded the reason i mention that is because the way it has been created and delivered has changed radically i think one of the challenges of audio is that its economic model is under tremendous pressure now as the consumption of audiobased edited products is rising – it’s just rising in a radically different way than as short as  years ago so your challenge is to work with the community on issues like drm and business models that still make money pages   related posts

comments made above regarding the programme the avid take over has been a disaster derek williams all platitudes neither mr hernandez nor his predecessor nor anyone else has ever been able to explain in simple logical terms the commercial wisdom in sacking the developers of sibelius the world’s best selling music scoring applicatiion leading to their reemployment by the industry giant yamaha to create a hot competitor for sibelius with that rationale the avid board should sack themselves and also seek employment at yamaha derek williams danwriter david good piece eldred empty corporate blabber jonah christian dear avid how come pro tools  is so buggy why does a company with millions maybe billions of dollars neglect its user base so much how does a company that makes the claim to be “the world’s leading provider of audio and video technology” have such a difficult time in clearing up bugs that seem to remain and haunt and plague it’s software version to version take a company like apple computer for instance who acquired emagic and their software logic years ago apple seemingly ignores development of logic no updates since  in over  months and yet the platform is at least twice as stable as pro tools  how can this be i wanted to take the time to write this letter because i am extremely frustrated your company has such stringent policies in regards to adhering to specific specifications to maintain compatibility and yet when they are followed to the letter your software is still buggy for example i am running a late  ″ imac model identifier  which falls into your “qualified models” category it is a core i  ghz with  gb of ram running os x  yosemite and pro tools  i am not running any rd party plugins whatsoever and yet i still have consistent bugs that inhibit me from being productive so see even when trying to eliminate all variables based on your companies own guidelines myself and i believe many others still have major issues with the stability of pro tools i certainly hope this letter does not fall on deaf ears as i plan to share it with as many people and on as many social networks that i can i will close by pasting in links to my last two threads on your forum i sincerely hope things change soon i will have to say that i don’t hold much hope for that though seeing as i have been a pro tools user for well over  years now and things remain pretty much the same unstable… sincerely a frustrated and disgusted pro tools user links to my current threads httpducavidcomshowthreadphpt httpducavidcomshowthreadphpt pages   featured
