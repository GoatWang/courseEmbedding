rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above

in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk

type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the
