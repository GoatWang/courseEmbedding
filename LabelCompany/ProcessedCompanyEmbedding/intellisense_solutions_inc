about us  our products  partners  contacts copyright intellisense solutions inc all rights reserved intellisense solutions inc home about us our products partners contacts welcome to intellisense solutions our web portal is the easiest way for you to buy and sell specialty food and products through the internet we connect individuals and companies who want to buy and sell the different variants of products through our website and our proprietary associated software buyers can conveniently browse through our web portal and directly connect to a seller before buying the product   there is inconsistency in the current market concerning a legitimate form of trustbased qualification system based on the ingredients used in food products   trust is also a major issue with regard to specific market most vegetarians and other nichecuisine communities are intuitively suspicious of unknown substances in their food this limits them to buy within a small selection of food which they are sure fit their eating customs the same is true for other communities such as muslims who buy halal products and jews who buy kosher products to overcome the lack of trust we plan to certify

will fund offering expenses solely from cash on hand  our cash balance is  as of march   and as of june   we do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations beyond one year’s time our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion this means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills this is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development there is no assurance we will ever reach that stage to meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering we believe that we will be able to raise enough money through this offering to expand operations but we cannot guarantee that once we expand operations we will stay in business after doing so if we need additional cash and cannot raise it we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash or cease operations entirely even if we raise  from this offering it will last one year but we may need more funds to develop growth strategy and we will have to revert to obtaining additional money in the next twelve months following completion of our public offering we plan to engage in the following activities to expand our business

person who will be contacting manufacturers vendors and buyers of vegetarian food and interest them in our product initially that person will also handle advertising this will include advertising our products and services in different venues including google adwards and potentially magazines and web site that are of interest to our target market marketing  company collateral design this will cover the cost of the design of the company and marketing collateral such as logo letterhead both for print and electronics business cards brochures advertising both for electronics and print design of logo certs this will include the design of the different certificates that will be included on the producers or wholesalers products collateral and web site different formats and variants of the certifications will be design to accommodate the different requirements of producers printing this will include the cost of printing letterhead business cards brochures envelopes etc software development web design this will include the cost of developing our web portal web site and associated interfaces software purchase development we expect that we may need to purchase some software development tools or software to ease development such as mysql database administration tool commercial code editors etc colocation  backup web hosting this will include the cost of leasing server space bandwidth and backup services we have not decided whether to lease dedicated servers virtual private servers or opt for a provider with cloud services such as amazoncom office rent if we raise sufficient funding to hire a sales person we may be renting or subleasing a small office where our sales person will work from if we are able to hire the sales person but are unable to afford an office the sales person will work from his or her home office equipment  sw this will be the cost of purchasing office equipment such as a computer for sales person an allinone printerscannercopierfax desk a filing cabinet etc… offices expenses these are expenses such as electricity cleaning supplies printer cartridges papers pens etc… telephone  ld fees this is the cost of internal telephone service to communicate between our staff directors vendors partners etc unaccounted expenses items not accounted for elsewhere or that are difficult to predict such as bank fees entertainment software products and office equipment accountant expenses for accounting fees this will go primarily toward the preparation of financial statements auditor expenses for auditing fees this will go to our auditor for our year end audits and quarterly reviews lawyer expenses for legal fees this will go primarily to our lawyer to ensure that all our filings are in order and we are in compliance with different regulatory regimes transfer agent this transfer agent fee related to the public company filings if  of shares are sold we will have enough money to maintain the company and develop a basic informational web site but we will not be able to do any development of our portal or do any sales and marketing activities if  of the shares are sold this will be sufficient to maintain the company and develop our products however we will have minimal amounts to spend on designing our marketing collateral and on the visual interfaces we will also have no money to spend on advertising if  of the shares are sold this will be sufficient to maintain the company and develop our products we will also have an acceptable marketing sale and advertising budgets we will however still not be able to hire a business development sales person and these functions will need to be performed by our directors if  of the shares are sold this will enable to execute fully on our business plan the company plans to begin work on an information web site in the first month of operation putting an informationonly web site as soon as possible will help to create brand name recognition we will also register youtubecom facebookcom and twittercom accounts and link them to our web site this will also improve our ranking in many search engines as well as build an audience for our anticipated launch if  of the shares are sold we are only able to maintain the company but will not be able to do any development or marketing and sales activities after selling  or more of the shares we will start working on

exporters and importers the company is based in seoul south korea while it lists vegetarian products these are incidental and constitute a minute part of their product listing as well this web site primarily target south koreans manufacturers and exporters global sources ltd wwwglobalsourcescom according to their web site “global sources is a leading businesstobusiness media company and a primary facilitator of trade with greater china the core business uses englishlanguage media to facilitate trade from greater china to the world the other business segment utilizes chineselanguage media to enable companies to sell to and within greater china” the company’s business address is listed in new york usa while it lists vegetarian products these are incidental and constitute a minute part of their product listing as well this web site primarily target chinese manufacturers and exporters alibabacom hong kong limited wwwalibabacom alibabacom is perhaps the best known businesstobusiness web site and aims at connecting chinese exporters to importers in the rest of the word while it lists vegetarian products these are incidental and constitute a minute part of their product listing as well this web site primarily target chinese manufacturers and exporters none of the businesses listed above focus on vegetarian food and simply allow companies to list their products without apparent review to the claims that the products meet the different classification of vegetarianism with our solution we intend to  focus exclusively on vegetarian products  vegetarian products will have to be placed in their appropriate classification  we will establish certificates for different classifications of vegetarian food such as ovolacto vegetarianism lacto vegetarianism vegan etc and will have authorized organizations or individuals to issue these certifications  we plan to build a truly global business emarket naturally we expect that india as the largest vegetarian market in the world will receive more attention from our company as a source of vegetarian products company description we are a development stage company which is in the business of operating a business where third party sellers can sell their food products through the internet via our designed web portals our operations to date have been devoted primarily to startup and development activities which include i formation of the company ii development of our business plan iii market research related to vegetarian food commerce and iv website development vegetarianism is the practice of following a plantbased diet including fruits vegetables cereal grains nuts and seeds mushrooms with or without dairy products and eggs a vegetarian does not eat meat including red meat game poultry fish crustacea and shellfish and may also abstain from byproducts of animal slaughter such as animalderived rennet found in some cheeses and gelatin vegetarianism may be adopted for ethical health environmental religious political cultural aesthetic economic or other reasons and there are a number of vegetarian diets vegetarians may consume these or other unfamiliar animal ingredients unknowingly however this presents a problem to many vegetarians who are not sure what to eat which limit their selection of products as well in the west the number of vegetarians is a very small percentage of the population and therefore it is difficult for supermarkets and distributors to source reliable sources of vegetarian products the above mentioned issues also apply to other niche cuisines such as halal and kosher food products for muslims and jews respectively while we plan to attack the halal and kosher food market in the longer term we plan to focus on the vegetarian food market in the first two years our company will focus on the development of portals to allow companies and individuals to engage in the purchase and sales of products over the internet we will focus on three markets where we find a need for such services  the vegetarian food market and its variants  the kosher food market  the halal food market we have registered domain names to target these specific market such veganemarketcom vegiemarketnet halalemarketcom and kosheremarketcom we have also registered our corporate web site at intellisensesolutionsinccom we will initially focus on the vegetarian market as we see this as a rapidly growing market with little or no competition present for a service like ours we will also develop a series of certifications for different types of vegetarian food such as ovolacto lacto ovo vegan etc and train a number of organizations or individuals who are authorized to issue such certificates we will charge such organizations and individuals a one time and yearly fees our portals will allow registered producers to advertise their products for a small fee prospective buyers most likely distributors or retailers are able to browse our web site for vegetarian products register and communicate with the vendor and further enquire about the products producers may highlight their products to the customers by becoming certified by us as producers of authentic vegetarian products a certified producer is able to include our certificates on their products another method of highlighting their products is by paying us a fee to insure that their products are displayed in a distinctive manner and ahead of nonpaid postings the company plans to start the development of our portal software as soon as we are able to procure financing we expect that the development and testing phase will take eight months to complete it will take a further fourth months to launch the vegetarian portal this business plan outlines our objectives as we
