us log in username password remember me create an account discovery and development  » aviragen discovery and development we have historically focused our research and drug development capabilities on discovering and developing small molecule compounds that can prevent or treat infectious diseases infectious diseases are caused by pathogens that are present in the environment such as viruses and bacteria which enter the body through various means and overwhelm its natural defenses and cause an infection the severity of an infectious disease varies depending on the nature of the infectious pathogen as well as the degree to which the body’s immune system or available therapies can prevent or fight the infection the use of antiinfective drugs has led to a significant reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases however for many infectious diseases current treatment options are associated with suboptimal treatment outcomes significant adverse or toxic side effects the emergence of drug resistant pathogens complex dosing schedules and inconvenient methods of administration these factors often lead to patients prematurely discontinuing treatment or not fully complying with treatment dosing schedules resulting in a treatment failure moreover a patient’s failure to comply fully with a recommended dosing schedule can both exacerbate the emergence of drugresistant strains we believe there remain significant unmet needs for new therapies for infectious disease and related respiratory and inflammatory disorders aboutaviragen

antiviral activity by interfering with the earliest stage of infection by inhibiting the attachment andor fusion of the virus to the host cell bta is equally active against both rsv a and b subtypes but has no known activity against other pathogenic viruses the ongoing doubleblind placebocontrolled phase iia trial is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of orally dosed

proteins from hpv and hpv e and e an interaction that is a step for hpv deoxyribonucleic acid dna replication and thus viral production and pathogenesis this inhibition results from the binding of bta to the e protein bta is a directing acting antiviral specific to hpv and possesses mechanism of action that can be exploited to treat infections caused by hpv types  and  bta is developed by combining

prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise
