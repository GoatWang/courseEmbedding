about      leadership      partners      news      events      careersabout nasuni originwhen the new york times launched its first web presence new cto andres rodriguez faced a major challenge – how to scale web services from  internal users to millions of subscribers andres’ it team could have purchased racks of web servers and load balancers but building out the times’ data center wouldn’t withstand the massive number of hits to its site when a major story broke instead andres turned to akamai whose use of the internet to replicate and cache content globally provided scale a single enterprise couldn’t match his early use of what is now considered a cloud service was a huge success as the times’ began digitizing more of its content and production workflows andres soon encountered his next big challenge – how to store protect and manage the files that were doubling in size and number every year he could have purchased racks of netapp nas devices backup solutions and disaster recovery infrastructure but this hardwarebased model could no longer support the magnitude of file growth a new file services approach uniting the performance and access of netapp with the scalability stability and global reach of akamai was needed andres’ idea for “nas unified” – nasuni – was born leveraging the “new disk”andres foresaw cloud object storage as the “new disk” – unlimited durable georedundant and economical his first company after the times – archivas – pioneered object storage in the cloud acquired by hds archivas is now the hitachi content platform hcp but how to get files – the world’s fastest growing type of data – into these cloud object stores a file system was the answer specifically a nextgeneration global file system that could support a unified set of enterprise file services andres decided to start nasuni short for “nas unified” paul flanagan became nasuni’s first investor paul shared andres’ vision and passion for a new type of global file infrastructure so fervently he later joined nasuni as its president a file system in the cloudnasuni’s key innovation – now patented – moves the inode structures of a file system from hardware to the cloud the result

network attached storage nas arrays have long been the solution for enterprise file sharing project directories group shares and user home drives with nas for primary storage backup infrastructure for data protection and replication or remote access for crosssite sharing have been the standard formula however continuing the cycle of nas refresh forklift upgrades backup replication and dedicated dr sites can no longer keep pace with the growth rate of unstructured data cost and complexity are too great and digital transformation objectives are not being met the nasuni solutionnasuni in combination with a hot tier of cloud object storage eg amazon s standard azure hot grslrs ibm cloud object storage is the modern solution to your nas refresh and consolidation challenges nasuni breaks the expensive nas refresh cycle saving it budget and staff time by using durable scalable cloud object storage in place of disk onpremises edge appliances for fast access to active files and the world’s first global file system that scales beyond the bounds of any individual storage array nasuni is quickly becoming the new scalable nas standard high performance file access builtin data protection unlimited scalability comprehensive security and support for any public or private cloud object store are all included at significantly lower cost than legacy nas infrastructure leading scalable nas capabilitiesnasuni addresses the need for scalable file storage with worldclass features cloudnative file system — nasuni unifs the first global file system designed to reside in the cloud stores the authoritative gold copy of every file in your preferred public or private cloud object store file storage can scale without limits and is accessible from all locations because data is no longer bound to or limited by a “master” storage device unlimited capacity — primary storage capacity scales in the cloud to any level required increasing space is simple and immediate high performance edge caches – nasuni edge appliances cache active files locally so users can access data without delay any number of physical or virtual appliances can be deployed in any location and sized to meet business needs the “cachefromcloud” architecture makes files readily available without having to deploy fullsized nas arrays in every site the edge appliances support standard nas protocols including smbcifs or nfs enabling project shares group directories and user home drives to be accessed using the local network without changing automation scripts or drive mappings integrated backup and recovery — nasuni continuous file versioning transmits every file change to the cloud as spaceefficient data “shards” not only does this eliminate the cost and overhead of third party file backup but it also provides virtually unlimited recovery points selfservice and it recovery options provide accelerated restore times as well integrated disaster recovery dr — nasuni’s cloud object storage partners automatically keep multiple copies of file data in different geographic locations to protect against regional disasters combined with nasuni’s ability to create edge appliances in minutes using the file system metadata stored in the cloud any location in the world that has power and cloud connectivity can now become a dr site the costs of dedicated dr sites and replication bandwidth can be eliminated strong security — all data stored in the cloud is strongly encrypted with customercontrolled keys that are not available to nasuni or the cloud vendor data is encrypted and decrypted locally in the edge appliances each edge appliance joins the organization’s active directory domain to take advantage of existing onpremises security access controls are encrypted in the cloud and can be seamlessly migrated to nasuni along with the file data for data migration and dr purposes how nasuni is different from traditional nas traditional nas infrastructure has many drawbacks continuous investments must be made in hardware and datacenter footprint adding cost complexity and management overhead as unstructured data requirements grow forklift upgrades are needed every  years to replace existing arrays with newer bigger models making files accessible in other locations requires costly mpls bandwidth and duplicate nas arrays to allow for replication or wan acceleration to provide remote access backing up files requires third party backup software and tape or disk backup targets dedicated sites with more duplicate nas infrastructure are needed for dr nasuni overcomes these drawbacks nasuni’s global file system stores “gold copies” of all files in your preferred private or public cloud object store nasuni edge appliances located onpremises provide high performance cached access to the active files without needing fullsized nas arrays in all locations capacity can be increased at any time with a few clicks edge appliances don’t have to be upgraded as capacity is added since only the active files are stored onpremises global file access is provided by deploying edge appliances in any location and leveraging nasuni’s use of the internet to propagate data changes backup and recovery is builtin with nasuni continuous file versioning dr is builtin leveraging georedundant cloud storage and nasuni’s ability to instantiate edge appliances in any location that can connect to the cloud nasuni primary nas benefitsreduce costsnasuni and cloud storage shift heavy upfront nas capex to predictable payasyougrow opex cloud storage scales in place without limits eliminating costs related to storage refreshes forklift upgrades and data migrations nasuni eliminates the costs of backup dr and replication increase agilitythere is no more guessing about how much primary file storage will be needed for the future adding more capacity can be performed on demand with a simple license update reduce riskbackup is builtin recovery points can be tight enough to mitigate everything from ransomware to accidental deletions recovery times can be as fast as your business needs mandate ensure business continuityprovide access to files no matter

provider nasuni is emerging from stealth with founder and ceo andres rodriguez formerly chief technology officer at archivas which was bought by hitachi data systems in feb  at the helm its first product the nasuni filer is a virtual appliance that runs on vmware it can be downloaded from the web and resides in a server at an end users data center it offers an interface to cloud data storage services using the cifs standard file network protocol rather than requiring customers to provide their own application integration into a web servicesbased cloud data storage service more on nas and cloud storage elearning firm combines clustered nas with the cloud cloud storage provider zetta looks to replace production networkattached storage dexrex gear offers cloud instant messaging and social media data archiving real estate company turns to cloud network attached storage meanwhile the customer can either manage a relationship with one of nasunis cloud storage service partners – amazons simple storage service s the rackspace cloud iron mountains cloud data storage services and nirvanix incs storage delivery network – or have its relationship managed by a channel partner rodriguez said nasuni can offer customers the option of a fixed  per month fee for unlimited capacity with one of the cloud service providers if the customer has either nasuni or one of its channel partners handle the provider relationship in addition to nasunis licensing costs the company has not publicly disclosed pricing for the product yet once data goes to the nasuni filer the appliance handles the transfer of data to and from the cloud service provider theres a natural bridge between the nas and cloud archiving worlds rodriguez said snapshots are that bridge the nasuni filer treats the cloud as if its raw disk it sends it chunks of data based on incremental snapshots of the local file system which are compressed and encrypted for transfer over the internet a copy of the overall file system structure along with the files and metadata is also stored in the cloud in case the primary appliance fails the snapshots are made as soon as hourly or as far apart as  hours the original files also remain in the local repository for awhile but files that havent been recently used will move off to the cloud to make room for active data the appliance isnt meant for large enterprises or highperformance data sets as theres some latency involved in bringing files down from the cloud should there be a cache miss rodriguez said nasuni is targeting customers with at least  gb of total data at least  gb of it file based with between  and  employees nasuni plans to make the nasuni filer generally available this spring with version  coming in the second half of the year in future releases rodriguez said nasuni will offer the ability to mirror data between cloud data storage back ends at different service providers an encryption key escrow option with a third party will also be added to later versions of the product the first version of the nasuni filer supports windows files only while support for other operating systems remains a roadmap item cost concerns have one user going to the cloud nasuni doesnt offer servicelevel agreements slas for the backend storage capacity managed by cloud data storage providers still one alpha tester said he plans to deploy the nasuni filer in production to avoid rising storage costs its always a concern but the value provided by applications and storage in the cloud is so significant for an organization of our size and technical reach that were willing to take our chances said john de souza director of it and systems at south bend indbased cressy  everett real estate even if theres an outage at  or  am on a sunday id rather have a couple thousand engineers working on it than me and my flashing cell phone cressy  everett has approximately  tb of total data and about  employees during alpha testing de souza said he put about  gb of data on the nasuni filer and attached five users to the nasuni filer instead of the companys existing local nas storage the users arent aware of the nas storage to begin with and from their point of view its the same experience he said in future releases de souza said hes hoping to see more detailed billing and consumption reports so he can rationalize the cost of cloud storage space and keep track of whos using what we back up using jungle disk he said and well sometimes get a  or  bill from amazon and be saying really why i want to be able to sit down and look at whats going on one channel partner that has already signed on fred nix cto at syscom technologies said he heard about the company through industry colleagues and has been involved since the whiteboard architecture stage of the product in getting it to market nix said hes excited about nasunis roadmap but admits the cloud storage market hasnt really taken off at this point theres been a lot of buzz
