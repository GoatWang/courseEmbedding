the company consultants in business engineering research ciber in may  htc global services acquired ciber contents  history  founding  s  s  acquisitionsdivestitures activities  references  sources  external links historyedit foundingedit ciber was founded in  by three individuals one of whom would remain with the company and guide its fortunes for its crucial first two decades of the three original founders of ciber bobby g stevenson emerged as the key figure in cibers history shaping a startup computer consulting firm into a leading national force by the s when the computer consulting industry was generating more than  billion worth of business a year a graduate of texas tech university stevenson spent the years between his formal education and the formation of ciber working as a programmer analyst for international business machines corporation ibm and ltv steel in houston by the early s when stevenson was in his early s he and two other colleagues decided to make a go of it on their own and organized ciber an acronym for consultants in business engineering and research at the time stevenson and cibers other cofounders perceived a need in the corporate world for specialized technical assistance in keeping pace with the technological advances in computer hardware and computer software the trio saw an opportunity to provide contract computer consulting services to clients lacking either in the resources or the expertise to use the promising power of computers in their daytoday operations through ciber the founders tapped into a market that would grow explosively in the decades ahead few realized at the time how important computers would become to the business world as the use of computers increased and wave after wave of computer innovations swept away yesterdays technological vanguard the need for sophisticated service firms like ciber to implement the frequently indecipherable technology of tomorrow grew exponentially although ciber entered the business of computer consulting services at a relatively early time the companys physical and financial growth did not mirror the growth of its industry ciber grew at a modest pace initially then embraced a new business strategy during the mids that ignited prolific growth stevenson watched over ciber during both of the companys two eras heading the company during its contrastingly slower period of growth and leading the charge during its decided rise during the s during cibers inaugural year of business stevenson served as the companys vicepresident in charge of recruiting and managing the fledgling firms technical staff a post he would occupy until november  when he was named cibers chief executive officer after the tragic accidental death of the ceo and cofounder richard l ezinga from late  into the s stevenson was responsible for all of cibers operations at first stevenson and the two other cofounders targeted their consulting services exclusively to the automotive industry establishing cibers first office in the hotbed of automotive production in the united states detroit michigan ciber did not remain wedded to the automotive industry for long however a few short years after its formation ciber began tailoring its services to the oil and gas industry as well a move that occurred at roughly the same time as the companys geographic expansion two years after the company opened its doors in detroit an office in phoenix was opened a year later in  an office was established in houston a denver office was opened in  followed by the opening of a dallas office in  and an atlanta office in  the following year ciber relocated its corporate headquarters to englewood colorado while executive officers circulated throughout cibers englewood facility the company embarked on the most prolific growth period in its history to that point sedit a year after the move to englewood and  years after its founding ciber competed in the burgeoning industry of computer consulting services as a minor player total sales in  amounted to a mere  million small change when compared with the revenue volume generated by the countrys leading computer consulting firms by this point however ciber executives were plotting an era of dramatic growth for their company during the mids stevenson and other ciber executives adopted a new growth strategy that focused on the development of a new range of services and the realization of both physical and financial growth through the acquisition of established computer consulting firms although the strategy embraced during the mids would take half a decade to manifest itself in any meaningful way once the strategy for the future began to take shape in tangible form ciber began its resolute rise to the upper echelon of its industry by the end of  when annual sales had slipped past the  million mark the plans formulated midway through the decade moved from the drawing board to implementation cibers expansion in  included the opening of offices in cleveland orlando and tampa moves that were associated with the development of new clientele in the telecommunications industry as ciber focused its marketing efforts toward telecommunications providers during the early s securing contracts with industry giants such as att gte and us west communications inc the company found itself occupying fertile ground in the computer consulting market not only were computers and their technology becoming increasingly sophisticated progressing at a pace that demanded the help of experts such as cibers consultants but the shifting dynamics of the corporate world also favored companies like ciber the early years of the s were marked by a national economic recession that forced many of the countrys corporations to alter their business strategies as business declined and profit margins shrank downsizing became the mantra of business leaders from coast to coast payroll was trimmed entire departments were cut from corporate budgets and as a consequence many companies found themselves lacking the resources and skills to perform certain tasks inhouse creating a greater need for the specialized services offered by ciber to meet this demand ciber contracted out specialists to help the nations largest corporations complete computer projects and cope with hardware and software problems as they arose ciber consultants wrote and maintained software that performed a host of chores including inventory control accounts payable and customer support although the conditions were ripe for rapid growth as the s began cibers stature at the start of the decade prohibited it to a certain degree from capturing a sizable share of the computer consulting market the company was too small to realize the growth potential that surrounded it mac j slingerlend who joined the company in  as executive vicepresident and chief financial officer before being named president and chief operating officer in  reflected on cibers diminutive size years after the company had grown into a genuine national contender noting we wanted to be a survivor we were the smallest national player and we needed to get larger quickly sedit getting larger quickly ranked as cibers chief objective during the first half of the s engendering a period of growth that lifted the companys revenue volume from the  million recorded when slingerlend joined the company to more than  million by the time he was promoted to the twin posts of president and chief operating officer growth was achieved largely by purchasing established computer consulting firms as ciber embarked on an acquisition program that ranked it as the most active computer consulting acquirer in the nation during the first half of the s more than a dozen acquisitions were completed in six years time adding more than  million to the companys revenue base and greatly increasing the coloradobased firms national presence equally as important as the growth achieved through acquisition was the added expertise ciber gained by swallowing up established computer consulting firms during the s the push was on to grow larger quickly and to gain personnel that would enable ciber to tackle more complex projects instead of just writing programs tailored to the specifications of its clients ciber executives were endeavoring to create a consulting firm that could identify problems and provide solutions a transformation that would propel the company into the market for highermargin services the majority of the acquisitions that helped ciber expand its services and broaden its national presence were completed after the companys initial public offering of stock in march  once the company converted to public ownership stevenson retained control of more than  percent of the companys shares acquisitions followed in steady succession in june  ciber acquired all of the business operations of millioninsales cpu inc for approximately  million based in rochester new york cpu operated as a computer consulting firm employing  consultants in six branch offices and served clients such as northern telecom and xerox corporation the cpu acquisition was cibers fifth of the decade and by far the largest in the coming two years as expansion picked up pace annual sales more than doubled and the companys net income inflated by the move into more complex highermargin services nearly quadrupled following the cpu acquisition ciber purchased holmdel new jerseybased interface systems inc a systemsconsulting firm with  consultants and  million in annual revenue interface systems was acquired in january  and was followed by the may  acquisition of spencer  spencer systems inc a consultant millioninsales computer programming provider with offices in st louis and indianapolis next in june  ciber reached across to the west coast and acquired concord californiabased business information technology inc a fivebranch consultant computer consulting firm with  million in annual sales a fourth acquisition was completed before the end of  when ciber purchased broadway  seymour inc its rochester minnesota office and its  consultants by the end of  sales had increased from the  million generated in  to more than  million and company executives were set to launch cibers cibr division a venture representative of the companys desire to provide more complex highermargin services introduced in december  cibr service was designed as a solution to a potentially devastating problem with wideranging ramifications many software programs written between the s and s used a twodigit date format to record calendar dates thereby rendering a host of computer calculations inaccurate after  pm december   without the ability to recognize  as the beginning of the new century computer programs that performed calculations related to inventory control invoices interest payments pension payments contract expirations license and lease renewals and myriad other tasks would generate false reports create computer bugs and perhaps cause systemwide shutdowns all under the presumption that  signified the year  cibers cibr division was created to solve the dilemma posed by the century date change and represented an area of substantial growth potential for the company during the latter half of the s at the time cibr service was being introduced ciber employed roughly  consultants and operated  branch offices scattered throughout the country more than half of the companys sales was derived from  clients including industry stalwarts such as american express company att ford motor company ibm mci telecommunications mellon bank monsanto corp us west communications inc and xerox corporation on the acquisition front  proved to be a busy year eclipsing the achievements of  in march the company acquired columbus ohiobased oasys inc a provider of contract computer programming services that gave ciber a new geographic location in columbus supported by  information technology consultants in may  ciber acquired practical business solutions inc an information technology company with offices in boston and providence rhode island two months later the company completed yet another acquisition purchasing the business systems development division of datafocus inc a

upgrade cibers board of directors criticizes boards poor performance corporate governance and compensation practicesnominates slate of three highlyqualified independent director candidates feb    et from lone star value management llc new york feb   prnewswire  lone star value management llc together with its affiliates lone star value we or us is a significant longterm shareholder of ciber inc ciber or the company nyse cbr with ownership of approximately  million shares of common stock  lone star value announced today that it delivered a formal notice to ciber of its intention to nominate three director candidates for election to the board of directors of ciber the board at the upcoming  annual meeting of ciber shareholders the  annual meeting lone star value is dedicated to enhancing shareholder value and improving shareholder rights for all ciber shareholders  in our view upgrading the incumbent board is a critical first step for shareholders to realize our goals lone star value believes that cibers stock is deeply undervalued due in large part to failures of oversight by the incumbent board and poor corporate governance  we fear many of the incumbent board members are more focused on their director fees and the prestige of serving on a public board in their hometown of denver than they are on maximizing value for cibers shareholders  during chairman jacobs tenure as a board member for example cbr stock has declined by more than  while he has made over  million in director fees  in addition average board member compensation during chairman jacobs tenure has risen from approximately  per year to approximately  per year and is paid mainly in cash  not the compensation terms shareholders want to see in a turnaround situation  as a sign of a poorly performing board management team turnover has been alarmingly high over the past ten years with four different ceos and four different cfos  we believe the incumbent board until very recently has repeatedly failed to find a suitable ceo to lead the company toward profitability and performance in line with its peers  cibers dismal operating performance for example is represented by a cumulative net loss to shareholders of more than  million share since  in gaap earnings and it has reported annual net losses in gaap earnings every year since  while its industry peers were much more profitable during this time period to be clear we have tremendous confidence in cibers new ceo michael boustridge  we believe he and his management team are beginning to execute on a longawaited turnaround of cibers operations as evidenced by cibers improved financial results in q   of course the incumbent board will try to take credit for hiring mr boustridge as ceo but it should be pointed out that the incumbent board only hired mr boustridge as ceo after our activist effort was initiated a year ago after lone star value gained representation on the board and after it had become undeniable that the previous ceo david peterschmidt hired by chairman paul jacobs had been a failure over his year tenure  we also have deep respect for ciber board member and company founder bobby stevenson both for founding the company and for owning almost  of its stock  unlike the other board members we believe mr stevenson thinks like an owner and is much more focused on shareholder value creation than his director fees we believe this board has failed in one of the most important roles for any board  recruiting the right management talent and creating the right incentives by compensating them based on performance  cibers unfortunate history with its former ceo mr peterschmidt is a strong example of the boards failure in this regard  chairman jacobs hired david peterschmidt as ceo in july  a time when ciber was in desperate need of a turnaround but unfortunately mr peterschmidt had no turnaround expertise  two years into mr peterschmidts tenure the board had apparently become concerned about his performance and decided to appoint mr boustridge to the board so he could step in as ceo if needed  a direct quote from chairman jacobs in  clearly explains the reasoning behind adding mr boustridge to the board in  michael was brought onto our board two years ago with succession planning in mind  we are fortunate to have a strong and qualified candidate with global operating experience  and because michael has been on our board he has a perspective of the role that no outside candidate could bring yet despite every indication that mr peterschmidt was grossly underperforming and had been for two years the board did nothing about it for another two years  it was not until lone star value launched a campaign to seek change on the board in  that cibers incumbent directors finally took action to replace the failed ceo  even then this board which well knew that mr boustridge would replace mr peterschmidt as ceo still renewed mr peterschmidts contract on march   and kept him on the payroll as a consultant for an additional year after his replacement as ceo  this board led by chairman jacobs rewarded mr peterschmidt with an exit package worth more than  million  mr peterschmidts exit package included a  oneyear consulting contract  cbr shares medical benefits moving costs from colorado to california closing costs related to the sale of mr peterschmidts home and the cost of renewing his executives status as a global services member on united airlines for two years  we believe mr peterschmidts superfluous addition to his compensation package was completely unnecessary and not required by his employment contract – essentially it was a tip while presiding over a period of disruptive management turnover and unnecessary compensation practices the board has also continually had poor corporate governance which is a sure sign of an entrenched board  the board has shown little appetite for fresh perspective in the boardroom with barely any turnover over the last  years  further the board has sought to stifle shareholders ability to seek change on the board through among other things a classified board structure and an absolute prohibition on the shareholders ability to call special meetings or act by written consent  leading proxy advisory firm institutional shareholders services iss rates cibers overall corporate governance with the lowest possible governance score of  on a scale of  to  with  indicating maximum corporate governance risk  two specific corporate governance areas have been highlighted by iss in its  grade maximum governance risk rating – shareholder rights and executive compensation furthermore through the course of our involvement with ciber the board has shown disregard for shareholder input and nonchalance in breaking its contractual commitments to shareholders  last year pursuant to an agreement with lone star value the incumbent board agreed to add a shareholder representative on the board richard coleman who has added tremendous value in the boardroom and whom we are renominating for election to the board this year in our agreement the board committed to actively search for two additional board members in order to upgrade and enhance the talent on the board  in the year since then one director betsy atkins joined the board but promptly resigned after only three months  other than that there is no evidence that the board took its obligations to upgrade and enhance the talent on the board seriously  in failing to replace ms atkins and to add an additional new director the board led by mr jacobs failed to honor its responsibilities to shareholders and its agreement with us lone star value has clearly expressed its views on the urgent need for improvement of cibers board and corporate governance practices to chairman jacobs in numerous calls and emails  the incumbent board has so far refused to make the necessary changes to avoid a proxy contest  we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that the behavior of the incumbent board will not change unless the personnel changes  we are convinced that reconstituting the board is imperative to improving shareholder value and rights  an upgraded board will be in a far stronger position to help the new management team in their continuing turnaround efforts at ciber  accordingly lone star value today submitted formal nominations of three highlyqualified director candidates richard k coleman jr robert g pearse and joshua schechter for election to the board at the  annual meeting  our nominees experience encompasses technology telecom business services financial and turnaround expertise  messrs coleman pearse and schechter not only possess substantial and relevant turnaround experience and a wellbalanced mix of skills but each also boasts an exceptional track record of creating shareholder value  each is committed to the highest levels of corporate governance  these proven valuecreators will ensure that the company evaluates with an open mind and a keen sense of urgency all strategic alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders if elected by our fellow shareholders our highlyqualified and experienced board nominees will immediately seek to align the companys interests with maximizing shareholder value improving the fundamental operations of the business to an operational level on par with its direct competitors and steer the company toward longterm profitability  our goal is to inject a sense of urgency while implementing a coherent strategy between the board and management team which will ultimately yield an increase in shareholder value shareholders can no longer put their faith in the incumbent board that has historically eroded shareholder value delayed cibers needed operating turnaround and stubbornly refused to implement proactive change on the board  at this stage change on the board should be made by the shareholders and for the shareholders we believe that only the shareholders and not the incumbent board should be allowed to choose new directors  we caution the board against thinly veiled reactive measures to entrench themselves under the guise of proactive action  we further remind the incumbent directors of their fiduciary duty to shareholders particularly in the context of any potential proxy contest and that actions taken in violation of shareholder rights and destructive of shareholder value may expose incumbent directors to liability that exceeds any do insurance coverage lone star value remains open to a meaningful dialogue with the board regarding its composition and corporate strategy and remains amenable to reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to reconstitute the board in a manner that is in the best interests of all shareholders  if no agreement is reached however lone star value is fully prepared to solicit the support of its fellow shareholders to elect all three of its director nominees at the  annual meeting  our nominees if elected will take their fiduciary responsibility very seriously and will represent the interests of all shareholders lone star values independent and highlyqualified candidates are richard k coleman jr age  is the founder and president of rocky mountain venture services  since  his company has helped businesses plan and launch new ventures and
