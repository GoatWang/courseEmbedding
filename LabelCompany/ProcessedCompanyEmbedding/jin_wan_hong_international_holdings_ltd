of equity instruments other than common stock is estimated using the blackscholes option valuation model in general we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract   we account for employee stockbased compensation in accordance with the guidance of fasb asc topic  compensation—stock compensation

tax rates and laws  a valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that based on available evidence are not expected to be realized   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured   stockbased compensation

pronouncements to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flow   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   not applicable to smaller reporting companies   item  controls and procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of november   using the criteria established in “internal control  integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso   a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of november   the company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below    we do not have an audit committee – while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee it is the management’s view that such a committee including a financial expert member is an utmost important entity level control over the company’s financial statement currently the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities    we did not maintain appropriate cash controls – as of november   the company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions and did not require dual signature on the company’s bank accounts alternatively the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the company had limited transactions             we did not implement appropriate information technology controls – as at november   the company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the company’s data or offsite storage of data in the event of theft misplacement or loss due to unmitigated factors   accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls   as a result of the material weaknesses described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of november   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by coso   system of internal control over financial reporting   although our company is unable to meet the standards under coso because of the limited funds available to a company of our size and stage of development we are committed to improving our financial organization as funds become available we will undertake to  create a position to  segregate duties consistent with control objectives  increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function  appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of our company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and  prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements   we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements as necessary and as funds allow  however because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected  these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks            part ii other information   item  legal proceedings   we know of no legal proceedings to which we are a party or to which any of our property is the subject which are pending threatened or contemplated or any unsatisfied judgments against us   item a risk factors   not applicable to smaller reporting companies   item  unregistered sales of equity securities and use of proceeds   there were no unregistered sales of equity securities during the quarter ended november     item  defaults upon senior securities   there were no defaults upon senior securities during the quarter ended november     item  mine safety disclosures   not applicable   item  other information   there is no other information required to be disclosed

procedures   disclosure controls and procedures   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in exchange act rule af the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate under the supervision and with the participation of management including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer the company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of august   using the criteria established in “internal control  integrated framework” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso    a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of august   the company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses as described below    we do not have an audit committee – while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee it is the management’s view that such a committee including a financial expert member is an utmost important entity level control over the company’s financial statement currently the board of directors acts in the capacity of the audit committee and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management’s activities           we did not maintain appropriate cash controls – as of august   the company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions and did not require dual signature on the company’s bank accounts alternatively the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the company had limited transactions in their bank accounts    we did not implement appropriate information technology controls – as at august   the company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the company’s data or offsite storage of data in the event of theft misplacement or loss due to unmitigated factors   accordingly the company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company’s internal controls   as a result of the material weaknesses described above management has concluded that the company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of august   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by coso    system of internal control over financial reporting   although our company is unable to meet the standards under coso because of the limited funds available to a company of our size and stage of development we are committed to improving our financial organization as funds become available we will undertake to  create a position to  segregate duties consistent with control objectives  increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function  appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of our company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures and  prepare and implement sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements   we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements as necessary and as funds allow  however because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected  these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions  projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks          part ii other
