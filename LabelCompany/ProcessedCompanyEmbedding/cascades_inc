cascades inc type public traded as tsx cas otcqb cadnf founded  headquarters kingsey falls quebec canada key people mario plourde ceo revenue 9 billion usd  net income 9 million usd  number of employees   website wwwcascadescom the companys montreal offices on sherbrooke street west cascades is a company that produces converts and markets packaging and tissue products composed mainly of recycled fibres cascades employs more than  people in more than  operating units in north america and europe it was founded in  contents  history  expansion  challenges  references  external links historyedit the lemaire family founded the drummond pulp  fibre company in  which is involved in the recovery of household and industrial waste in  antonio lemaire and his sons officially ventured into the production of paper made from recycled fibres when they took over a disaffected mill in kingsey fallsquebec owned by the dominion paper co papier cascades inc was born of that transaction in  cascades began its expansion in kingsey falls with the creation of cascades formapak its first mouldedpulp mill to use  recycled fibres the event marked the beginning of a veritable papermaking corporation in a small town in the center of québec from  to  the successive startup of papier kingsey falls multilayer board cascades industries tissue paper plastiques cascades and cascades conversion in  the lemaire brothers brought their skill and knowledge outside kingsey falls for the first time with the startup of the containerboard mill papier cascades in cabano québec this was the beginning of a great adventure that would bring cascades all over the world in  cascades shares began trading on the montreal stock exchange that same year its entry into the united states began with the startup of cascades industries inc in rockingham north carolina in québec cascades began producing kraft paper in east angus and acquired a boxboard plant in joncquière the following year in  the company made its entry into europe with the acquisition of a boxboard plant in la rochette france this new expansion took shape in  with the creation of cascades sa and the acquisition of another french boxboard mill in blendecques from  to 9 other mills located in sweden and belgium became part of the cascades group as well djupafors ab in sweden and kartonfabriek van duffel nv in belgium the belgian mill was renamed cascades duffel nv but ceased its production in 9 after heavy losses and then was immediately transformed into a cutting center for the other european mills of the group declared definitively closed in the accounts of 9 it was reconverted in  by the expresident of the board of cascades laurent lemaire to a socalled internal commercial agency under the name with slightly modified orthography of cascade duffel nv and having only one unit of establishment called korton fabrick van ouffel located at the exact address of the old mill kartonfabriek van duffel which was resold by cascades to another company in 9 this socalled agency before different fiscal controles  without collaborator working in belgium was implied at the time of exports of cartonboard out of europe in particular those in transit by the port of antwerp according to boards of directors of cascades sa of june   and nov   since 9 m stephane thiollier and m vincent lestringant despite he died in  are not anymore members of the board of cascades duffel nv both have been replaced in may 9 by m jean goulet general manager of cascades sas  france and by m zaki haned investor relations manager at reno de medici but if cascades duffel nv was liquidated with immediate effect the  the story seems not finished yet see also the  last external links below expansionedit the s decade played out in a spirit of innovation with the creation of a research and development center in  in kingsey falls the facility became the largest private canadian research and development center in the pulp and paper industry on the eve of the nineties decade cascades became daring when it created cascades énergie this subsidiary controlled a brand new cogeneration plant powered by natural gas the first in canada and whose mandate was to provide the energy required by all the cascades mills in kingsey falls the success of this project enabled cascades to invest further in the prospective energy sector with the acquisition of boralex in 9 today boralexs shares are traded on the toronto stock exchange in which cascades holds a  interest cascades énergie paved the way for a series of acquisitions in which cascades activities were largely diversified the purchase of rolland and paperboard industries corporation in 9 perkins papers in 9 provincial papers in 9 and that same year the creation of norampac in partnership with domtar led to the restructuring of cascades into five distinct corporate groups whose operations were focused as much in the sector of specialized packaging as in those of containerboard tissue paper fine papers and boxboard on an international level cascades expansion continued in europe with the acquisition of the boxboard mill in arnsberg germany in 9 and the startup of a sheeting operation in wednesbury england in 9 upon entering the new millennium the scope of the tissue paper sector grew in  with the acquisition of the mills in pennsylvania and in wisconsin two years later the group sustained its momentum and set up shop in alberta in new york in arizona in oregon and in tennessee in  the boxboard sector stood out with the acquisition of dopaco inc a leader in the packaging products sector destined for the quick service restaurant industry not to be left out norampac proceeded with the implementation between  and  of several ultramodern corrugated cardboard mills in canada and in the united states in  cascades created in europe four new companies in luxembourg cascades luxembourg sarl norampac luxembourg sarl cascades hungary ltd luxembourg branch and norampac ltd luxembourg branch beginning of  cascades canada inc luxembourg branch was created and with the closure of cascades duffel nv in belgium the closure of norampac ltd luxembourg branch and the existing pulp  paper cascades nv become bv  in the netherlands that carries to four the number of companies in service in  into the benelux without any coworker who works on itnorampac luxembourg sarl was closed in september  by incorporation into cascades luxembourg sarl new capital february  usd  9   and beginning of february  cascades canada inc luxemburg branch changed her name to cascades canada ulc luxembourg branch challengesedit an appreciating canadian dollar an increase in energy prices and the cost of fibre fierce competition the s also provided challenges for cascades which forced it to implement a significant rationalization plan this process resulted in the closure of mills in thunder bay montréal red rock pickering buffalo and boissy le chatel in  the company proceeded with the sale of its fine papers cascades resources and its tissue paper wood wyant distribution assets with the purchase of domtars shares in norampac in  and the merger of its european boxboard operations with reno de medici in  cascade has consolidated its position as a leader in the containerboard and boxboard sectors in  northamerican boxboard activities were integrated into norampacs cartonboard activities in addition to creating synergy this integration allowed better sharing of technology and led to the creation of a larger packaging group to meet the needs of clients in canada and the united states in  cascades named mario plourde chief operating officer enabling alain lemaire president and chief executive officer to devote more time to the strategic vision of the company also in  cascades sold dopaco inc its paper cup and carton converting business for the quickservice restaurant and foodservice industries to reynolds group holdings limited net proceeds from the transaction will mainly be used to pay down cascades debt in keeping with its origins but definitely being forwardlooking cascades is banking on its products that contain a high percentage of recycled fibres to distinguish itself from the competition while remaining committed to the principles of sustainable development that is so dear to its corporate philosophy cascades also demonstrates that it understands that only innovation and the marketing of environmentally sound products will guarantee its future success in october  cascades was named one of canadas
