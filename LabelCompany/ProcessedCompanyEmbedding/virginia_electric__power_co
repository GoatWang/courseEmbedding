east coast midway between the southern tip of florida and the northern coast of maine the states coastal plain occupies the eastern part of virginia and includes the site of the first english settlement in colonial america several of the states modernday major population centers and the nations largest coal port to the west the flat coastal plain meets the rolling hills and basins of the piedmont region along a boundary typified by rapids and waterfalls however most of the states hydroelectric power is supplied from further west where the rolling hills rise into the blue ridge mountains the valleys and ridges that occupy the western part of the state parallel the spine of the appalachian mountains and along with the appalachian plateau they contain most of the states coal virginias primary energy resource the appalachian plateau which cuts across the southwestern corner of virginia also holds almost all of the states oil and natural gas fields more than half of virginia is forested and the states widely distributed forests provide abundant biomass offshore winds may provide an additional energy resource a recently discovered but undeveloped uranium deposit near the states southern border may be one of the nations largest energy consumption in virginia is more than twice the states energy production the electric power sector is the leading energy consumer in the state followed closely by the transportation sector virginia has the thirdlargest statemaintained transportation network in the nation including six major interstate highways more than a dozen railroads operate on  miles of railway in the state and two of the nations busiest commercial airports and one of the nations largest seaports are located in virginia the commercial sector and the residential sector each consume much more energy than the states industrial sector and despite virginias diverse climate per capita energy consumption in the state is below the national average petroleum virginia has a small amount of crude oil production in the far southwestern corner of the state but no appreciable reserves exploration for oil and natural gas elsewhere in the state has not been successful there are no operating petroleum refineries in the state and virginia is not crossed by any major crude oil pipelines refined petroleum products arrive in the state by pipeline and at the states ports two major petroleum product pipelines the colonial pipeline and the plantation pipeline deliver refined petroleum products to locations in virginia the colonial pipeline originates in texas and has several delivery locations in virginia before reaching its endpoint in new jersey the plantation pipeline brings petroleum products north from louisiana and mississippi to its terminus in northern virginia near washington dc virginia also receives petroleum products from overseas at its ports in newport news and norfolk the states only petroleum refinery located at yorktown suspended refining operations in  but it continued to function as a products terminal importing finished motor gasoline diesel fuel and other products for sale to markets from south carolina to new york it was sold in  and the new owners converted the facility into a storage depot and transportation hub in  the site was connected to the colonial pipeline system and more recently the rail and dock facilities at the refinery have been expanded to accommodate train and tanker deliveries about threefifths of the petroleum used in virginia is consumed as motor gasoline several counties in the northern and eastern parts of the state require the use of specially blended motor gasoline to reduce harmful emissions about  in  virginia households uses fuel oil kerosene liquefied petroleum gas or other petroleum products for home heating natural gas two of virginias coalbed methane fields are among the nations top  natural gas fieldsvirginias natural gas fields are located in seven counties in the southwestern corner of the state in recent years more than seventenths of the states natural gas production has come from coalbed methane wells drilled into coalrich formations rather than from conventional natural gas reservoirs two of virginias coalbed methane fields are among the nations top  natural gas fields as ranked by proved reserves virginia produces a small fraction of the nations natural gas in the past three decades the states natural gas production increased significantly with gross withdrawals peaking in  at more than  times their  volume however virginias natural gas production still equals only about onethird of state demand most of virginias natural gas supply is delivered via several major interstate natural gas pipelines natural gas supplies come to virginia from both the gulf coast and the appalachian regions in past years the largest share of the states natural gas supply came from the south in  however natural gas movements into virginia from the south began to decline and while the supply from west virginia remained fairly constant more natural gas entered the state from the north through maryland as natural gas production in pennsylvania increased in future planned pipeline expansions will allow more natural gas supplies to flow from pennsylvania into virginia almost half the natural gas that enters virginia exits the state most of it moves into maryland but some goes to north carolina and tennessee a small amount of the natural gas leaving virginia is distributed to washington dc and the surrounding maryland suburbs by the local natural gas utility some of the natural gas that enters virginia is stored in two depleted fields that have a combined capacity of  billion cubic feet natural gas consumption by virginias electric power generators has risen sharply since  increasing almost fourfold by  when it reached more than half of the natural gas delivered to consumers in the state by  the electric power sector consumed three times as much natural gas as the residential sector the secondlargest natural gas consuming sector in virginia one in three virginia households uses natural gas for home heating coal virginia ports are the leading exporters of us coalvirginia ports are the leading exporters of us coal typically shipping more than onethird of the nations total most of it from out of state although virginia has almost  active coal mines recoverable reserves at the states producing mines are less than  of the nations total virginias annual production is also less than  of the nations total all of the coal mined in virginia is bituminous and most of that coal leaves the state more than onethird of virginias coal is exported to other nations and more than onethird is sent to other states the remaining coal is used instate primarily by electric power generators most of the additional coal needed in virginia is brought into the state from west virginia and kentucky electricity natural gas contributes the largest share to electricity generation in virginia coal was the primary fuel used for electricity generation in the state until  when its share fell below that of nuclear power as coals contribution fell natural gasfired generation increased and in  natural gasfueled generation exceeded that of coal for the first time by  natural gasfired generation surpassed that of nuclear power natural gas now provides about twofifths of the states net electricity generation the states two nuclear power plants with two reactors each supply about onethird of virginias electricity generation coal provides most of the rest although biomass petroleum and hydropower also provide electricity and there is a small but increasing amount of distributed customersited smallscale generation from solar photovoltaic energy virginia residents consume more electricity than is generated in the state retail electricity sales are highest to the commercial sector followed closely by sales to the residential sector most virginia households have air conditioning and slightly more than half of all state households use electricity for home heating renewable energy virginia has abundant biomass in  biomass provided almost  of the states total net electricity generation wood and wood waste along with municipal solid waste and landfill gas are among the commonly used forms of biomass used to generate electricity in virginia in addition biomass is used to produce ethanol there is a cellulosic ethanol demonstration plant in lawrenceville virginia that converts municipal solid waste into ethanol a larger commercial plant in hopewell virginia produces ethanol using corn as the feedstock virginia also has five biodiesel plants that use a variety of feedstocks virginias bath county pumped storage station is the largest pumped hydroelectric facility in the worldhydroelectric generation is variable and typically contributes less than  of virginias net electricity generation the state has both conventional and pumped hydroelectric facilities virginias bath county pumped storage station with a generating capacity of  megawatts is the largest pumped storage hydroelectric facility in the world during periods of low demand inexpensive power is taken from conventional power plants to pump water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir during periods of high demand the water is released from the upper reservoir and flows to the lower reservoir electricity is generated as the water flows through turbines that are located between the reservoirs although the plant uses more power than it generates it supplies power in periods of peak demand when electricity prices are highest virginia has limited onshore wind energy resources however substantial wind energy potential exists off virginias atlantic coast and in the chesapeake bay in march  the us bureau of ocean energy management boem issued an offshore wind energy research lease to the virginias department of mines minerals and energy dmme the virginia dmme is planning to conduct wind energy research offshore by building a gridconnected megawatt wind test facility on the outer continental shelf ocs off the coast of virginia the demonstration project known as virginia offshore wind technology advancement project is in a research area adjacent to the commercial virginia wind energy area the project has received the first federal ocs wind energy research lease issued by the us boem in march  the boem approved the projects research activities plan virginia has established a voluntary renewable portfolio goal encouraging investorowned utilities to acquire  of base year  sales from eligible renewable technologies by  virginia also enacted a mandatory utility green power option in
