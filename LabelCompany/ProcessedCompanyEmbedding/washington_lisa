names homeland security secretary kelly as chief of staff by abby phillip  robert costa  philip rucker  ashley parker washington  president donald trump ousted white house chief of staff reince priebus and replaced him with homeland security secretary john kelly on friday a major shakeup designed to bring order and military precision to a west wing beset for six straight months by chaos and infighting and with few tangible accomplishments with his legislative agenda largely stalled trump became convinced that priebus was a weak leader after being lobbied intensely by rival advisers to remove the establishment republican fixture who has long had friction with some of trumps innercircle loyalists according to white house officials kellys hiring is expected to usher in potentially sweeping structural changes to the turbulent operation kelly intends to bring some semblance of traditional discipline to the west wing where warring advisers have been able to circumvent the chief of staff and report directly to the president sidestepping the policy process according to people with knowledge of his plans kelly a retired fourstar marine general earned trumps approval for his work combating illegal immigration and his leadership qualities both in the battlefield and at the department of homeland security according to white house officials who said the president been talking about replacing priebus with kelly for the past few weeks he is a great american and a great leader trump tweeted john has also done a spectacular job at homeland security he has been a true star of my administration the president added i would like to thank reince priebus for his service and dedication to his country we accomplished a lot together and i am proud of him the announcement comes after deep personal animus between priebus and anthony scaramucci newly appointed as white house communications director burst into public view thursday when scaramucci accused the chief of staff of leaking damaging information about him to the news media and savaged priebus in a profanitylaced interview with the new yorker priebus said in a statement it has been one of the greatest honors of my life to serve this president and our country i want to thank the president for giving me this very special opportunity i will continue to serve as a strong supporter of the presidents agenda and policies i cant think of a better person than general john kelly to succeed me and i wish him gods blessings and great success allies to priebus said he told them he had resigned on thursday concluding that the internal chaos would only escalate one priebus friend said the chief of staff had described the situation as unsustainable saying he felt demeaned by the presidents treatment of him and was frustrated that he could not assert control over basic white house functions such as policy development communications and even white house announcements  which sometimes were made impulsively by the president such as this weeks announcement to ban transgender people from serving in the military but some white house officials said the decision for priebus to depart was made by trump and that the president forced him out on friday these officials noted that priebus presided over the friday morning senior staff meeting and accompanied trump to a law enforcement event in new york regardless his final departure was a humiliating coda for what had been a largely demeaning tenure during which priebus endured regular belittling and emasculation from rival advisers  and even at times the president himself when air force one touched down friday afternoon at andrews air force base priebus senior policy adviser stephen miller and social media director dan scavino all loaded into a suburban but moments later miller and scavino hopped out of the vehicle and as word trickled out about the chief of staffs ouster reporters inched close to snap photos of priebus who sat alone on the rainsoaked tarmac priebus vehicle then pulled out of the presidential motorcade which proceeded along to the white house without him i think any observer  including one that did not speak english and knew nothing about politics and came from another planet and solar system  could after observing the situation in the white house realize the white house is failing said one informal white house adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share a candid assessment and when the white house is failing you cant replace the president trump has long been drawn to military leaders  my generals he calls them  and by appointing kelly the president hopes to bring military discipline to his oftenunruly west wing kelly is expected to be sworn into the job on monday morning and convene a cabinet meeting kelly who is widely admired by trump family members and loyalists has formed a bond with the president over recent months that was fortified when he aggressively defended the travel ban policy their relationship has only grown stronger since with trump telling aides that he sees kelly as someone who dutifully follows through on his agenda  including a border security crackdown and sharp reduction in illegal immigration  and does not cause him problems sarah huckabee sanders the incoming white house press secretary said of kelly in a statement the entire administration loves him and no one is comparable sanders also commended priebus for his service he was loyal in his dedication to the president she said the president thanks him and his family for his great service to the country and he will always be a member of the trump team priebus who as chairman of the republican national committee nurtured a close relationship with trump during last years campaign was named white house chief of staff to bring washington experience to the administration of a political novice part of priebus pitch for the job was that he could use his longstanding relationships with republican leaders on capitol hill  including house speaker paul ryan rwis a personal friend  to help pass trumps ambitious agenda including major legislation on health care and taxes but priebus became consumed by internal battles clashing not only with scaramucci but finding himself under siege by trump advisers inside and outside of the white house who complained that he was ineffectual and more concerned with his own public image than the presidents after scaramucci was named communications director last week against priebus vehement objections white house officials widely believed that priebus position had become more imperiled rumors of priebus firing have circulated for months now as one senior white house official put it there was a phony death march for six months but the dynamic changed over the past  days or so it reached a fever pitch of the president complaining about reince to all of us said this official who requested anonymity to speak candidly if we heard it once we heard it  times in the last week  this erosion of confidence the word was weak  weak weak weak cant get it done trumps own family had soured on priebus at least several weeks prior jared kushner the presidents soninlaw and senior adviser had been telling associates he believed priebus was doing a poor job and running the white house ineffectively  a view that both ivanka trump the presidents daughter and adviser and first lady melania trump also privately conveyed to the president any negative mention of priebus in a news story  even a single sentence or mere clause  would often elicit frantic phone calls from the more junior staffers reporting directly to him the sort of vigorous defense in the media the president came to believe was not afforded to him the impression within the white house  that priebus was most concerned with defending his own image  further undercut his standing with trump and the presidents family both kushner and ivanka trump were supportive of priebuss departure friday but also expressed admiration for kelly according to an administration official ryan issued a statement praising priebus saying he left it all out on the field for our party and our country he has achieved so much and he has done it all with class ryan said i could not be more proud to call reince a dear friend on friday as trump traveled to new york he took both scaramucci and priebus on air force one with him asked to comment on the changes trump told reporters traveling with him that priebus is a good man and that kelly is respected by everybody kelly has a warm rapport with white house chief strategist stephen bannon who has worked closely with him on shaping the administrations border enforcement policy they have built a connection over their families military service bannon a former navy officer has a daughter who graduated from the us military academy at west point kelly is also well liked by kushner who sees him as a stable presence with a low key personality he has described kelly to associates as the kind of figure hed like to see have more say in the administration kellys reputation and ability to work with both wings of a warring west wing made the decision easier for trump the officials said    the washington posts tom hamburger contributed to this report    video the unsurprising yet still humiliating departure of reince priebus

do about affordable care act by sean sullivan  kelsey snell  ed okeefe washington  congressional republicans on friday glumly confronted the wreckage of their sevenyear quest to abolish the affordable care act blaming each other and president donald trump for the dramatic earlymorning collapse of the effort but finding no consensus on a way forward some gop lawmakers clung to longshot hopes that some version of the legislation might be revived and that a deal might yet be struck before the fall but the senates rejection early friday of a lastditch barebones proposal to roll back just a few key planks of the law left gop leaders with few options for uniting their sharply polarized ranks hours later house republicans gathered in the capitol to take stock of the situation some raised the prospect of abandoning their longstanding pledge to repeal and replace the aca and instead working with democrats to shore up weak spots in the law known as obamacare but trump signaled little interest in that approach leaving many lawmakers baffled about how to proceed im not a prophet said rep tom macarthur rnj who helped push an earlier version of the repeal bill through the house i dont know what comes next politically the collapse of the repeal effort is potentially devastating for republicans it leaves trump without a significant policy achievement in the critical first six months of his presidency it casts a pall over the partys coming drives to pass a budget and overhaul the tax code and it exposes gop lawmakers to rising anger from their conservative base substantively it leaves much work undone while the aca has made health insurance accessible to millions of americans it has failed to contain rising costs especially in the individual insurance market where people without access to employer provided coverage buy policies without federal action  and additional cash  those marketplaces could become unstable lawmakers in both parties have called for stabilizing the marketplaces but many republicans have little appetite for entering negotiations on the issue with democrats i dont think the democrats have any interest in doing anything productive said sen ted cruz rtexas a vehement critic of the aca he added republican senators are going to go home theyre going to hear from their constituents and i dont expect the response to be muted at the meeting of house republicans speaker paul ryan rwis summed up the mood by citing an old gordon lightfoot tune called the wreck of the edmund fitzgerald about sailors drowning on a sinking ship entering and exiting the meeting lawmakers offered a variety of ideas for addressing their predicament and excuses for how they got here we just ran out of time it was an artificial deadline said rep mark meadows rnc chairman of the hardright freedom caucus he predicted that republicans would still get a bill to trumps desk in september other republicans called on their colleague to start over and work with democrats through the regular committee process to craft an aca overhaul that could win bipartisan support a key leader of the gop repeal effort rep greg walden rore said he is willing to take that approach and sen john mccain rariz the man credited with driving a stake through the heart of the latest gop health measure issued a rousing call to bipartisanship the vote last night presents the senate with an opportunity to start fresh mccain said in a statement it is now time to return to regular order with input from all of our members  republicans and democrats  and bring a bill to the floor of the senate for amendment and debate democrats too expressed interest in working across the aisle especially on a plan to make federal costsharing subsidies permanent the subsidies  which will total about  billion this year and  billion in   reimburse insurers for reducing copayments and deductibles for certain lowincome customers reducing their outofpocket costs trump administration officials have yet to say whether they will continue financing the subsidies past the end of this month on friday senate minority leader charles schumer dny said he spoke with ryan about potential areas of cooperation the insurance industry hardly our allies have said the number one thing to stabilize the system and bring premiums down is to make the costsharing permanent schumer said that would have a lot of support schumer expressed hope that fridays healthcare vote would prove to be a magic moment that sparked a wave of bipartisanship but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky sent early signals that he is skeptical of requests for more federal money to shore up the aca after fridays vote failed mcconnell stood redfaced and dejected on the senate floor now i think its appropriate to ask what are their ideas mcconnell challenged democrats itll be interesting to see what they suggest as the way forward for myself i can say  and i bet im pretty safe in saying for most on this side of the aisle  that bailing out insurance companies with no thought of any kind of reform is not something i want to be part of trump meanwhile continued to express mainly hostility toward the aca on friday he unleashed a series of tweets blaming  republicans and  democrats in the senate who let the american people down by rejecting the latest overhaul proposal as i said from the beginning let obamacare implode then deal watch trump wrote he also called for senate republicans to abolish the filibuster  a venerable senate procedure designed to protect the minority party that requires contentious matters to receive the votes of at least  senators as republicans weighed working with democrats they were also struggling to resolve hard feelings toward one another rep mo brooks rala who is running for senate placed primary responsibility for the failureof fridays vote on mcconnell rep charlie dent rpa blamed trump saying the president never really laid out core principles and didnt sell them to the american people rep steve king riowa issued a combative statement criticizing mccain and sen lisa murkowski ralaska who also voted no friday king accused murkowski of waging a successful writein reelection campaign in  that was essentially a revolt against gop primary voters and he said mccain recently told the senate he would return and give all of you cause to regret the nice things you said about me he kept his word earlier this week mccain who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer flew to washington and cast a vote that helped his colleagues begin debate on the latest gop proposal to overhaul obamacare on tuesday he delivered a stirring address calling for a bipartisan approach to overhauling the  healthcare law and criticizing the highly secretive and partisan process that had produced the pending legislation the speech set the stage for what was to come in the wee hours after midnight friday mccain  scarred from recent surgery to remove a blood clot that unearthed his cancer  rebuffed a lastminute appeal from vice president pence on the senate floor he emerged from his talks with pence at  am approached the senate clerk and gave a thumbs down  joining murkowski and sen susan collins of maine as the only republicans to vote against the legislation the measure failed  to  with all  members of the democratic caucus voting no stunned gasps and some applause echoed through the chamber mcconnell and his leadership aides stood nearby grimfaced and despondent maybe this had to happen to actually begin to have a conversation said sen bill cassidy rla who had tried and failed to broker a bipartisan compromise the president challenged us to replace not just repeal and so once you decide that you want to replace not just repeal it becomes more difficult on friday sen bill nelson dfla said he and collins were working on a new bipartisan health plan sen joe manchin iii dwva a centrist facing reelection said he met wednesday night with  other senators and were going to keep talking meanwhile mccains office announced friday afternoon that he would fly back to arizona for radiation and chemotherapy on monday but that he would be back in washington in the fall but while talk of bipartisanship was ascendant in the senate many house members were angry with their senate colleagues for letting the repeal effort fail outside fridays house gop meeting rep david schweikert rariz told an old joke shared around the capitol to illustrate the tensions youre a brandnew member and the guys all pop down next to you and say see across the hall thats your opposition the other side of the capitol thats the enemy  schweikert said turns out it could be true    the washington posts juliet

you is amazon getting too big by steven pearlstein is amazon getting too big c  the washington post · jul     pm amazons general counsel david zapolsky had a lot on his mind last month when he and four members of his legal team visited the offices of new america a liberalleaning think tank in washington the retail juggernaut was days from announcing its  billion purchase of whole foods a deal that would not only roil the grocery industry but also trigger a government antitrust investigation into the strategies and practices of the everything store and as zapolsky was no doubt aware no organization had been more dogged in raising those concerns than new america  and in particular a yearold law student named lina khan earlier this year the yale law journal published a word note by khan titled amazons antitrust paradox the article laid out with remarkable clarity and sophistication why american antitrust law has evolved to the point that it is no longer equipped to deal with tech giants such as amazoncom which has made itself as essential to commerce in the st century as the railroads telephone systems and computer hardware makers were in the th its not just amazon however that animates concerns about competition and market power and khan is not the only one who is worrying the same issues lie behind the european unions recent  billion fine against google for favoring its own services in the search results it presents to its users they are also at the heart of the longrunning battle in the telecom industry over net neutrality and the ability of cable companies and internet service providers to give favorable treatment to their own content they are implicated in complaints that facebook has aided the rise of fake news while draining readers and revenue from legitimate news media they even emerge in debates over the corrupting role of corporate money in politics the decline in entrepreneurship the slowdown in corporate investment and the rise of income inequality and just last week democrats cited steppedup antitrust enforcement as a centerpiece of their plan to deliver a better deal for americans should they regain control of congress and the white house for amazon which prides itself on its relentless consumer focus the suggestion that its spectacular growth might not be in the public interest poses a particular challenge since it was published khans note has drawn more than  readers online  an extraordinary reach for a law review article her work has been cited by the economist the financial times forbes wired the wall street journal and the new york times and she has appeared on major broadcast media last spring she was invited to join some of the most prominent academics in antitrust law to speak at an economic conference at the university of chicago khan is amazed and a bit amused by all the attention born in london where her pakistani parents met as college students she grew up in a welltodo new york city suburb before heading off to williams college where she was editor of the school newspaper looking toward a future in journalism she moved to washington and soon found herself working as a researcher at new america on issues relating to economic power thinking a law degree would allow her to be a more effective advocate she headed off to yale law where she impressed instructors with her keen mind thorough preparation and passion for economic justice in her second year she began researching the history of antitrust law to understand why it has failed to provide much of a check on corporate power amazons antitrust paradox was the result i was blown away by what she produced said david grewal a professor who advised khan on her project it didnt read like a student note it was equal to the best legal scholarship combining scholarly elegance with an activist agenda and enormous attention to detail most of my colleagues would give their little finger for a piece that got that much attention grewal said only half joking next year after the bar exam and a wedding khan will return to yale for a postgraduate year before heading off for a clerkship with judge stephen reinhardt on the us court of appeals for the th circuit in california a feeder judge to clerkships on the supreme court    next year will mark the th anniversary of the publication of robert borks the antitrust paradox a book that even its critics acknowledge changed the direction of antitrust law although a longtime law professor at yale bork was a charter member of the chicago school of law and economics which argued that judges should use rigorous analysis of economic consequences in deciding antitrust cases previously much of antitrust doctrine was based on somewhat vague political notions that big was bad  that large corporations with large market shares inevitably used their power to drive rivals from the market raise prices buy favorable treatment from legislators and regulators in  the supreme court even went so far as to declare that any merger that achieved more than  percent share of any market should be considered unlawful relying on economic theories that competition  or the threat of it  could be counted on to discipline dominant firms bork argued that rather than helping consumers most antitrust enforcement was likely to do the opposite stifling innovation and preventing companies from realizing efficiencies of scale and scope that could be passed on to consumers in the form of lower prices more choice and greater convenience chicago school economics was a marriage of the latest in economic modeling and free market ideology in considering whether a proposed merger or business practice would harm competition courts and regulators narrowed their analysis to ask whether it would hurt consumers by raising prices and since chicago theory pretty much assumed away the ability of even a dominant firm to raise prices the answer was almost always no and so began a year stretch in which the government blocked relatively few mergers and prosecuted almost no companies for monopolizing competition the chicago school runs deep and the courts still partake of the borkian koolaid said steven salop an antitrust expert at the georgetown university law center who has long argued that antitrust enforcement is too permissive at the chicago conference this spring richard posner a federal appeals court judge who with bork is considered a pioneer of chicago antitrust analysis asked mischievously antitrust is dead isnt it there is little debate that this cramped view of antitrust law has resulted in an economy where twothirds of all industries are more concentrated than they were  years ago according to a study by president barack obamas council of economic advisers and many are dominated by three or four firms whats now at issue is whether the outcome has benefited society research by john kwoka of northeastern university for example has found that threequarters of mergers have resulted in price increases without any offsetting benefits kwoka cited industries such as airlines hotels car rentals cable television and eyeglasses and even former antitrust officials acknowledge that their approval of googles purchase of youtube and ita software and facebooks acquisition of instagram and whatsapp look naive in hindsight eliminating the kinds of companies that might have someday challenged the tech sectors most dominant firms the current market is not always a good indication of competitive harm said khan in laying out for me her critique of the way the government goes about analyzing proposed mergers they have to ask what the future market will look like economists meanwhile complain that antitrust analysis has failed to fully incorporate the insights of modern game theory information theory and behavioral economics that go a long way to explaining why consumers companies and markets dont behave the way chicago school theory says they should as nobel prizewinning economist jean tirole has demonstrated chicago antitrust theory is ill equipped to deal with hightech industries which naturally tend toward winnertakeall competition in these most of the expenses are in the form of upfront investments such as software think apple and microsoft meaning that the cost of serving additional customers is close to zero customers naturally gravitate to the platform with the largest network of customers think facebook or their success depends on having the most customer data think google they also often have two sets of customers who need each other such as credit card companies that serve merchants and cardholders or internet service providers that link content producers with content consumers what this postchicago economics shows is that in such industries firms that jump into an early lead can gain such an overwhelming advantage that new rivals find it nearly impossible to enter the market while even experienced ones find it difficult to stay in the game to varying degrees amazon displays all these characteristics and by its breadth and complexity confounds traditional antitrust analysis what began as an online book retailer now sells just about everythingunder the sun not just online but more recently also through physical stores and pickup depots in hundreds of highvolume categories amazon is not only a retailer but also produces its own branded line of merchandise through its online marketplace customers can buy from amazon but also from millions of competing retailers who typically pay a  percent to  percent commission and now account for half of all unit sales on the amazon platform  and a quarter of amazons total profits many of these thirdparty sellers pay additional fees to store their inventory in amazon warehouses use amazon robots and personnel to fulfill customer orders or rely on amazon to deliver their goods to customers across the globe through its fleet of  planes and  trucks or its deeply discounted delivery contracts with ups and fedex this remarkable business machine offering  million items for sale is fast approaching the point where it can claim nearly every household in america as a customer and through its ayear prime program amazon uses free delivery and access to its premium video service to bolster loyalty of customers who each spend an average of  per year the experience of my own household surely attests to this by one estimate at current growth rates half of all american households will be prime customers by  this description of amazons business is drawn largely from its public filings and reports from market analysts as is its custom amazon declined to comment or answer questions for the record jeffrey p bezos the companys founder and chief executive is the owner of the washington post amazon has brought us to a new and better place khan said so did the early railroads and steel company giants but i dont think amazon is the problem  the state of the law is the problem and amazon illustrates that in a powerful way    is amazon so successful is it getting so big that it poses a threat to consumers or competition by current antitrust standards certainly not here is a company after all known for disrupting and turbocharging competition in every market it enters lowering prices and forcing rivals to match the relentless efficiency of its operations and the quality of its service that is after all usually how firms come to dominate an industry and there is nothing illegal about that but under the antitrust law once a firm is dominant its actions and business practices become subject to more rigorous scrutiny to make sure it is not abusing its dominant position and like all dominant firms amazon disputes its dominance much is made of the fact that more than half   percent  of americans begin their online shopping trips on amazon but as amazon is quick to point out online sales still account for less than  percent of all retail sales which is the more relevant figure as the line between online and bricksandmortar disappears by that standard walmart is still nearly four times amazons size retailing however is a sector not a product market the usual frame of reference for antitrust analysis and other than books amazons original market where it maintains a commanding  percent market share amazon doesnt have anything close to monopolylike market shares in clothing for example where it has made a big push amazon accounts for  percent of online sales but less than  percent overall amazon will soon dethrone best buy as the largest seller of consumer electronics but even there its overall share will be only  percent amazons purchase of the parent of diaperscom has helped give it a  percent share of the online baby products market but that translates into less than  percent of overall sales in that category even with the whole foods purchase amazon will have only a  percent share of the  billionayear american grocery market well below the more than  percent market share for walmart and  percent for kroger that is why most antitrust experts think there is little chance that the government will try to block the deal but in her article khan argues that these metrics do not capture the architecture of amazons emerging market power if amazon is so small and its growth so benign she asks then why does the prospect of amazons entry into a market dramatically drive up its own stock price while driving down those of its rivals why she asks have so many large and successful bricksandmortar retailers been unable to make significant inroads into online retailing while so many small retailers feel they have no choice but to use amazons platform to reach their customers antitrust analysis generally assumes dominant firms often exercise their market power by raising prices but what if amazon exercises its market power khan asks by squeezing the profit margins of its suppliers what if its strategy is to keep prices low in markets it dominates to gain entry into new markets that will generate still more sales and profits how she asks can antitrust regulators analyze the structure of a market and amazons bargaining power in it when so many of amazons competitors are also its customers or suppliers why did sears stock rise  percent on the day that it announced its kenmore line of appliances would be sold through amazon why do walmart google oracle and ups all consider amazon their biggest threat and if amazon is not a monopolist khan asks why are financial markets pricing its stock as if it is going to be antitrust enforcers should be    concerned about the fact that amazon increasingly controls the infrastructure of online commerce and the ways it is harnessing this dominance to expand and advantage its new business ventures khan wrote in her law review article as khan sees it amazons strategy and business practices are neither anticipated nor understood by current antitrust doctrines and the language and tools by which regulators and judges now analyze the companys business practices totally miss the game whats the difference between behavior designed to increase market share and behavior to drive out competitors khan asks the problem is they look a lot alike    it probably wont surprise you to learn that most antitrust practitioners reject accusations from a thirdyear law student that the legal precedents and analytical tools they have developed and mastered over the years are inadequate to the task of protecting us from the predations of big tech lame argument huffs timothy bresnahan an economics professor at stanford who as chief economist for the justice departments antitrust division helped bring the monopolization case against microsoft i dont lie awake at night worrying that there are so few creative people in this country that one company might turn out to be the best at everything said a former head of the antitrust division a former member of the federal trade commission put it this way the antitrust law i believe in is that we want to give as much latitude as possible to innovate and deliver better products at lower prices and only stop them when we see some evidence of conduct that excludes others from competing they also scorn khans suggestion that the consumer welfare standard that underlies most antitrust analysis should be broadened to a public interest standard that takes into account the impact of dominant firms on workers communities and the political process as they see it such vague and subjective standards would merely invite political and ideological mischief but if you push them most of these old antitrust hands will also acknowledge that the law has not fully come to grips with the competitive dynamic in the era of online platforms and networks i think there is a fair bit of flexibility in the law to allow us to adjust and adapt to modern markets and technologies said diana moss president of the american antitrust institute moss cited recent cases that looked beyond consumer prices to take in issues such as innovation bargaining power and arrangements that lock consumers into existing products the real problem she said is in getting more judges and enforcement agency officials to pay attention to those issues indeed without the focus on prices judges would be forced to make more subjective judgments about the intent behind a companys action or speculate about whether new companies would or could enter a market in the future while judges are reluctant to wade into such murky waters particularly in markets where the technology and business strategies are rapidly evolving it is precisely in those industries that a more holistic approach is required lurking in the background of the current debate is us v microsoft the biggest antimonopoly case to come along in a generation while the chicago schools antitrust adherents view the clintonera prosecution of the software giant as a flagrant overreach against a successful innovator defenders of the antitrust law cite it as proof that current law has been successful in dealing with hightech monopolists and indeed if the trial judges ruling had been fully upheld that might be the proper conclusion but in fact a federal appeals court subsequently narrowed that ruling and rejected the trial judges order that the company should be broken up as john d rockefellers standard oil trust had been nearly a century before in the end the case was settled by the bush administration on terms considered largely favorable to microsoft the ambiguous legacy of the microsoft case  and the relative weakness of american antitrust law  was highlighted last month when the european union imposed a record fine on google for using its virtual monopoly in internet search to favor its own comparative shopping sites the federal trade commission had looked at the same issue several years before and closed its investigation without taking serious action one reason it was not clear that even if google is favoring its own site which it denies such practices are illegal that wasnt always the case back in the prechicago days when big was bad the supreme court had ruled that eastman kodak could not leverage its monopoly in the film market to gain advantage in the market for film developing but in more recent cases the supreme court and two appeals courts relying on chicago law and economics raised the bar declaring that there must be a dangerous probability of obtaining a second monopoly for a dominant firms behavior to be illegal some observers point to the eus google case as an example of the difference between the american and european approach they protect competitors we protect consumers this oftenused distinction betrays a cultural smugness on the part of americans one based on the view that our approach fosters the kind of creative destruction that results in great leaps of technological managerial or financial innovation while theirs allows secondrate rivals to accomplish through politics what they could not accomplish in the marketplace to me this view betrays a naive belief that in our open market system every person and every company has the same opportunity to succeed although government cannot and should not try to neutralize all the ways in which success breeds more success neither should we assume that success in the marketplace is solely due to hard work ingenuity and superior execution leveling the playing field is a legitimate policy goal a good economic system is not only efficient but also conforms to common intuitions of fair play the logic and intent behind americas centuryold antitrust laws is that even innovation and productivityinducing competition needs to be managed to ensure a healthy ecosystem in which a relatively few corporate giants dont use the economic advantages they have won to tilt the playing field even further in their favor i think we have to go back to the original spirit of the antitrust laws said luigi zingales an economist at the university of chicagos business school known for his skepticism about government regulation a narrow purely economic approach has been unable to capture the concerns people have about the concentration of economic and political power    while amazon is not yet a threat to competition it is well on its way to becoming one which is probably why the company is taking these arguments  and those who make them  more seriously amazon is reported to be in the market for an antitrust economist and in the wake of the whole foods announcement it has engaged the services of two former heads of the justice department antitrust division one democrat and one republican i cant tell you exactly at what point the government should step in to block amazon from buying another company or curtail some of its business practices i am however fairly confident in saying that it ought to be well before amazon achieves a  percent market share in books groceries clothing hardware electronics and home furnishings and it ought to be before amazon pulls even with ups in shipping oracle in computing and comcast in media content khans reasonable insight is that if we dont yet have the tools to identify when companies have reached that competitive tipping point then someone ought to invent them and as for those bad old days when government officials still had the wisdom and the courage to call a monopolist a monopolist lets remember it was the governments aborted prosecution of ibm the most innovative and respected company of its day that made microsoft possible the prosecution of microsoft that made google possible and the breakup of att that made apple and wireless telephony possible google apple and amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world and every day they deliver enormously valuable products said sen elizabeth warren dmassachusetts in a speech last month at new america but the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors that want their chance to change the world there is nothing in economic theory that makes it inevitable that successful disrupters will be disrupted indeed what history demonstrates  and what a yearold law student now reminds us  is that it sometimes takes a little public power to keep private power in check flamingo fashion makes a comeback by matthew boyle flamingo fashion makes a comeback

incalculable factor says ryan mathews a consultant and futurist the path is the same but the ride is a whole lot faster and bumpier the flamingos ride began way back in  when a young graphic artist with the fitting name of donald featherstone created a plastic pink flamingo for union products which sears offered in its catalog for  a pair suburbanites snatched them up as lawn ornaments and they soon became widely reviled as the dregs of bad taste as a new york times story put it when union products closed in  the notoriety caught the attention of avantgarde director john waters whose  breakout film pink flamingos boasted the tag line an exercise in poor taste flamingos were briefly a mascot of gay culture but largely petered out with few mourning when union products closed its

newman has written a straightforward autobiographical love song right she chose me a ballad on dark matter his first album in nine years opens with lush strings a torchsong piano and the soulful gumboish croon thats distinctively his own this had to be for your wife hes told gretchen is inside the beautiful house they built together newman is sitting out back on a clear pacific palisades morning hes joined by an old friend the record producer lenny waronker probably he says since i wrote one s i miss you to my first wife this ones for her that would be a perfect way to leave it the master songwriter with the shortdistance dedication but newman chews on his answer like a chunk of overcooked flank steak even though i didnt know her when i wrote it i dont think he continues i wrote it  i hope this doesnt affect me getting the academy award for this one but i wrote it for cop rock that would be the musical police drama that lasted for a single season on abc in  its actually possible he wrote she chose me for both cop rock premiered in september of that year he and gretchen were married a month later i just wrote it newman says finally and laughs im a professional songwriter i dont need a wife fair enough in the almost  years hes been recording newman has been able to create a stunning body of work by staying in character his firstperson portraits of the heartbroken heartbreaking and misunderstood and his political satires have earned him a loyal fan base the admiration of his peers and the occasional oddball controversy his lone top hit s short people confused enough people who didnt get the mock attack to inspire protests and an attempt in the maryland legislature to ban it this month in classically newmanesque style he made headlines for a song that he decided was too vulgar to record for dark matter his new album the demo is called what a dick randy newman writes comic song about donald trumps penis the london guardian proclaimed spincom reprinted the lyrics dark matter which arrives aug  is only newmans fifth album since the carter administration its worth the wait matter includes arrangements that could carry one of frank sinatras nelson riddle records narratives told in the voices of the kennedys longgone bluesman sonny boy williamson and vladimir putin and a closer wandering boy thats achingly sad there is also the albums leadoff track an epic called the great debate it is what it sounds like scientists on one side true believers on the other arguments over global warming evolution and religion mention is also made of a manipulative writer named mr newman its a crazy way to start a record an eightminute song that goes to all these places says mitchell froom the albums coproducer but its stunning  in the old days the golden era of pop craftsmanship the record company grunts would be hounding him nagging newman for the next record these days hes on his own clock he works in a broken industry in which even an artists dream label such as nonesuch has its limits on dark matter newman kicked in about  to help pay for the recording it is important to serve the songs as best i can he says and if i think i need a few more guys and they wont pay for it i do if it needs it it needs it ask newman about legacy about his place in music and youll hear a mix of modesty frustration and pride he takes pride in his approach to listen to and watch the behavior of others hes always found other peoples stories more interesting newman watched segregationist and then georgia governor lester maddox on the dick cavett show before writing s rednecks sung from the point of view of a southerner with a scathing view of northern racism the nword is the chorus waronker remembers being struck by newmans curiosity from the start once waronker says we were in new york i was working there and randy came back to see me randy was  i must have been  or even younger and one night he said im going out and he comes back around midnight or a little later and i said where did you go and he said i just took a cab ride and i said why did you do that and he said i just liked talking to the cabdriver it is a small thing and i might have blown it up over the years but its these things  not only does he see the interesting part of different people coming from different places but he is able to understand them and become them now that is hard i remember that cabdriver newman cuts in and laughs i remember what he had to say it was terrible stuff about women mostly  he kept going and going and going and uh actually i wanted to get out but i couldnt exactly get out where i was amos newman his oldest son and the product of his first marriage to roswitha boss thinks that his fathers songs are often deeply personal even if theyre in the voice of someone else theres a song called memo to my son which is ostensibly about me he says at the time i might have been the only child then theres the world isnt fair and my life is good which is clearly not him but its his perspective theres a thing on there about taking his kids to private school and he sees the mothers there the mothers dressed up ready for the night diamond pearls whatever it was there clearly are things that are from his own observations and his own experiences newman is clearly at peace with his place in music at a recent concert in lowell massachusetts he sat at the piano and dutifully played the song thats most popular with the millennials toy storys youve got a friend in me but he also delivered one of his toughest and best songs sail away a cheerfully delivered tale told from the perspective of a slave trader with good humor newman also poked fun at his destiny as a critically acclaimed commercially challenged songwriter he demonstrated his original version of you can leave your hat on it slogs along a creepy grind from a man you would certainly not want to bring home for thanksgiving then he jokes about the upbeat covers popularized by joe cocker and tom jones talking after the show newman says he once cared enough about this stuff to consider calling three dog night to ask them not to release their version of his mama told me not to come as a single waronker persuaded him to let it go mama told me not to come they made that a hook whereas i didnt newman says i didnt even say it one of the times we got to a chorus i must be antithetical to hit  the records never come easy dark matter may have been the toughest i had these songs for in a couple of cases two years and i would go in there and move forward a little and i was having trouble making up my mind newman says i dont know why but it happened to me thats where mitchell froom came in the producer whose résumé includes elvis costello and los lobos has worked with newman since s bad love this time around froom came to the house set up a microphone and spent a month making demos something for newman to judge it surprised me how ambitious he was froom says and how prepared he was to work on it as hard as he did you see somebody work through a series of good ideas to get to great ones and with the arrangements it would be the difference between something that worked very well and it would sound like him and id be satisfied and id say thats great but then a week later he would come up with something that was greater there it wasnt fast or easy or any of those things but really impressive newman wrote putin a comic take on the russian leader more than two years ago long before the electiontampering news cycle took hold he was inspired by the shirtoff stuff the whole part of his personality that apparently wants to be not only the richest man in the world and the most powerful man in the world by default and wants to be tom cruise he wants to be a star brothers came out of his desire to consider the relationship between not just the kennedys but brothers in general the song darts into an aside on george preston marshall the late redskins owner who held out on signing any black players until  and throws a musical changeup with a section on cuban singer celia cruz there are also a pair of songs about those who are lost on the beach is about a high school friend who drifts away wandering boy is the story of a child who grows up and disappears from his fathers life when hes asked about the song newman chokes up a reaction that he admits later surprises him i dont know why but when something like that happens reason tells me its about yourself he says i think i imagine having lost a kid one of my children i mean i did to write it i imagine that and i imagine a guy i went to school with who ended up on skid row or on the beach wherever he was staying who fell out the idea of falling out has always been interesting to me back in pacific palisades waronker and newman are talking about songwriting again the producer mentions that often younger bands he works with will be in awe when they learn how close he is with newman theyll ask if they can come to the house to meet the master that would for many be a wonderful compliment on which to rest newman naturally doesnt view it way how come they dont write like that then he asks as though he doesnt totally trust his friends anecdote they cant waronker says randy its not that easy columnists pulitzerwinning opinion from the most respected voices in the world at dunkirk the deliverance of a nation by michael gerson at dunkirk the deliverance of a nation michael gerson · jul     pm washington  that one of the greatest victories of world war ii was a mass evacuation  more than  british and french troops taken off a beach at dunkirk  was a preview of the industrial nature of that conflict feats of organization  such as the return of allied troops to other french beaches on dday  took precedence over military panache it is the reason that dwight eisenhower was the indispensable irreplaceable man not george pattonbut dunkirk also proved the comparative advantage that democracies have in modern war the ability of free people to selforganize it was nearly  private watercraft including pleasure boats and paddle steamers that braved the luftwaffe to ferry the surrounded troops home the future of a free britain was delivered directly by its own citizenschristopher nolan’s film “dunkirk” is a spare telling of that story from the firsthand perspective of soldiers sailors airmen and civilians only briefly does the camera pull out to reveal the epic scale of events most of the time we are scrambling flying swimming and sinking along with the confused participants there is little dialogue and almost no backstory for the main characters the soldiers are played by essentially interchangeable young actors but they somehow work as standins for the waiting vulnerable mass they are not humanized just human and their motivation doesn’t require much artistic development doing everything they can to get off the damn beach and get home the craft of the movie is taking the fragmented individual experiences of the characters and weaving them inexorably into a narrative that clarifies in a single scene i will not sully this review with a spoiler but the events of the film eventually come together with a pleasing click dramatizing how the choices of individuals both noble and base gather into something larger than themselves in this case the deliverance of a nation the government leaders of the time have no direct voice in the movie including the familiar voice of winston churchill the lack of political context works as an artistic device but the experience of the movie or so i lectured my children is enriched by knowing some of the history the swift collapse of france the utter isolation of britain an american president hamstrung by isolationists doing what he could to help the recognition that world war ii was a citizens’ war should not obscure the importance of leadership dunkirk perhaps more than any other event of the war was churchill’s moment as french resistance disintegrated it was estimated that only  soldiers could be taken off the beaches before the perimeter collapsed  effectively leaving britain undefended to german invasion churchill told parliament to prepare for “hard and heavy tidings” to his war cabinet he raised the possibility of contaminating british beaches with poison gas when the germans came at the same time in america charles lindbergh the original advocate of “america first” gave a radio address dismissing president franklin roosevelt’s proposal for rearmament as “hysterical chatter” roosevelt himself told the british ambassador that the british government might need to continue the war from canada in london churchill was receiving the same suggestion to move the government and royal family across the atlantic he replied that “no such discussion” should be permitted when the director of the national gallery proposed sending the most irreplaceable paintings to canada he replied “no bury them in caves and cellars none must go we are going to beat them” the tired men of churchill’s government raised the prospect of a negotiated peace churchill responded “nations which went down fighting rose again but those who surrendered tamely were finished” speaking to his full cabinet he said “if this long island story of ours is to end at last let it end only when each one of us lies choking in his own blood upon the ground” the success at dunkirk made churchill’s defiance a realistic option and solidified his hold on power guns ammunition and artillery to rearm the evacuated army flooded in from the commonwealth and by clever ruse from america british planning for a return to the continent began the same month as the dunkirk evacuation ended dday was already in mind it is a brilliant artifice in the movie “dunkirk” to have churchill’s most famous oration  “we shall fight on the beaches”  read aloud by one of the soldiers who finally reaches safety it was average people who gave churchill’s roar reality and force but the roar was indispensable michael gerson’s email address is michaelgersonwashpostcomc  washington post

nigerian man who succinctly expressed the reaction of much of the world to america these days “your country has gone crazy” he said with a mixture of outrage and amusement “i’m from africa i know crazy but i didn’t ever think i would see this in america” a sadder sentiment came from a young irish woman i met in dublin who went to columbia university founded a social enterprise and has lived in new york for nine years “i’ve come to recognize that as a european i have very different values than america these days” she said “i realized that i have to come back to europe somewhere in europe to live and raise a family”the world has gone through bouts of antiamericanism before but this one feels very different first there is the sheer shock at what is going on the bizarre candidacy of donald trump which has been followed by an utterly chaotic presidency the chaos is at such a fever pitch that one stalwart republican karl rove described the president this week as “vindictive impulsive and shortsighted” and his public shaming of attorney general jeff sessions as “unfair unjustified unseemly and stupid” kenneth starr the onetime grand inquisitor of bill clinton went further calling trump’s recent treatment of sessions “one of the most outrageous  and profoundly misguided  courses of presidential conduct i have witnessed in five decades in and around the nation’s capital” but there is another aspect to the decline in america’s reputation according to a recent pew research center survey of  countries people around the world increasingly believe that they can make do without america trump’s presidency has made the us something worse than just feared or derided it is becoming irrelevant the most fascinating finding of the pew survey was not that trump is deeply unpopular  percent have confidence in him compared with  percent who had confidence in barack obama at the end of his presidency that was to be expected  but there are now alternatives on the question of confidence in various leaders to do the right thing regarding world affairs china’s xi jinping and russia’s vladimir putin got slightly higher marks than trump but german chancellor angela merkel got almost twice as much support as trump even in the united states more respondents expressed confidence in merkel than in trump this says a lot about trump but it says as much about merkel’s reputation and how far germany has come since  trump has managed to do something that fear of putin could not he has unified europe facing the challenges of trump brexit and populism a funny thing has happened on the continent support for europe among its residents has risen and plans for deeper european integration are underway if the trump administration proceeds as it has promised and initiates protectionist measures against europe the continent’s resolve will only strengthen under the combined leadership of merkel and new french president emmanuel macron europe will adopt a more activist global agenda its economy has rebounded and is now growing as fast as that of the united states to america’s north canada’s foreign minister recently spoke out in a friendly and measured way noting that the united states has clearly signaled that it is no longer willing to bear the burdens of global leadership leaving it to countries like canada to stand up for a rulesbased international system free trade and human rights to america’s south mexico has abandoned any plans for cooperation with the trump administration trump’s approval rating in mexico is  percent his lowest in the world china’s leadership began taking advantage of trump’s rhetoric and foreign policy right from the start announcing that it was happy to play the role of chief promoter of trade and investment around the world cutting deals with countries from latin america to africa to central asia according to the pew survey seven of  european countries now believe that china is the world’s leading economic power not the united states the most dismaying of pew’s findings is that the drop in regard for america goes well beyond trump sixtyfour percent of the people surveyed expressed a favorable view of america at the end of the obama presidency that has fallen to  percent now even when american foreign policy was unpopular people around the world still believed in america  the place the idea this is less

writers group what if the president gives an order to do something improper or illegal by david ignatius what if the president gives an order to do something improper or illegal david ignatius · jul     pm washington  if president trump ordered a senior government official to support the firing of special counsel robert mueller how should that person respond adm mike rogers head of the national security agency answered my question about that onstage last week at the aspen security forum he began with the usual caveat that he wouldn’t answer a hypothetical but then offered a comment that brought spontaneous applause“i will not violate the oath i have taken in my  years as a commissioned officer” he said he regularly reminds nsa employees to recall their own oaths and ask themselves “why are we here what are we about what is it that we are defending  i won’t sacrifice that for anyone” in trump’s washington it’s a fact of life that officials must now weigh whether they would follow presidential orders that might be improper or illegal officials mull and occasionally discuss quietly what to do if a presidential request for loyalty conflicts with their sense of right and wrong a possible order to fire mueller is an imminent concern but there are other tests of loyalty and conscience that could arise with this impulsive policybytwitter chief executive take trump’s proclamation wednesday that transgender people shouldn’t serve in the military this apparently caught the pentagon by surprise and contradicted a waitandsee statement by defense secretary james mattis how should he and his generals respond to the president’s edict mattis and his commanders must also ponder how they would react to an impulsive order to conduct military action somewhere can they say no to the commander in chief presidential orders cannot ordinarily be ignored or dismissed our system gives the commander in chief extraordinary power jack goldsmith a harvard law professor and former assistant attorney general explains in an email “a subordinate in the executive branch has a presumptive duty to carry out the command of the president if one doesn’t want to for any reason one can resign  or refuse the order and face a strong likelihood of being fired”for a military officer the standard is even tougher soldiers must obey orders unless they’re unlawful under our system of civilian control if the president issues an order as on transgender soldiers the military’s default response is to carry it out courts may find the presidential order to have been unconstitutional but the military cannot make its own policy or law how should congress and justice department officials weigh their choices as trump threatens openly to fire attorney general jeff sessions presumably to clear the way for firing mueller it’s useful to think about the unthinkable  as a way of surfacing and hopefully preventing abuse of power let’s start with justice since sessions recused himself from the russia investigation an order to fire mueller for now would go to deputy attorney general rod rosenstein  who has strongly indicated he would refuse in june members of the senate appropriations committee got this commitment “i am not going to follow any orders unless i believe those are lawful and appropriate orders special counsel mueller may be fired only for good cause and i am required to put that cause in writing” can congress obtain similar pledges from other senior officials of the justice department who would be in the chain of command during the watergate scandal attorney general elliot richardson and his deputy william ruckelshaus felt bound by the commitments they had given congress not to fire special prosecutor archibald cox a similar chain of obligation should be forged now to circumscribe trump’s ability to sack mueller given the expectation that rosenstein and probably others would quit rather than fire mueller the white house seems to be thinking about installing a new attorney general who wouldn’t have the recusal problem and could be counted on to fire trump’s nemesis members of congress are said to be gaming this option thinking of ways to block a recess appointment or to extract a promise from any sessions successor to leave mueller alone that’s another good firewall protecting mueller by statute may be impossible because of the constitutional separation of powers if he is fired though congress could enact a new independent counsel law at least providing the authority needed for a continuing investigation that will get to the truth of what happened in dealing with this administration lawmakers and other officials can’t wait until the bomb detonates they should begin to take precautions now david ignatius’ email address is davidignatiuswashpostcomc  washington post writers group sessions lessons by charles krauthammer sessions lessons charles krauthammer · jul     pm washington  transparency thy name is trump donald trump no filter no governor no editor lies between his impulses and his public actions he tweets therefore he is ronald reagan was so selfcontained and impenetrable that his official biographer was practically driven mad trying to figure him out donald trump is penetrable hourly never more so than during his ongoing war on his own attorney general jeff sessions trump has been privately blaming sessions for the russia cloud but rather than calling him in to either work it out or demand his resignation trump has engaged in a series of deliberate public humiliations day by day he taunts sessions attacking him for everything from not firing the acting fbi director which trump could do himself in an instant to not pursuing criminal charges against hillary clinton what makes the spectacle so excruciating is that the wounded sessions plods on refusing the obvious invitation to resign his dream job the capstone of his careertrump relishes such a catandmouse game and by playing it so openly reveals a deeply repellent vindictiveness in the service of a pathological need to display dominance dominance is his game doesn’t matter if you backed him as did chris christie cast out months ago or if you opposed him as did mitt romney before whom trump ostentatiously dangled the state department only to snatch it away leaving romney looking the foolish supplicantyet the sessions affair is more than just a study in character it carries political implications it has caused the first crack in trump’s base not yet a split mind you the base is simply too solid for that but amid his  to  percent core support some are peeling off both in congress and in the protrump commentariat the issue is less characterological than philosophical as stephen hayes of the weekly standard put it sessions was the original trumpist  before trump sessions championed hardline trade law enforcement and immigration policy long before trump rode these ideas to the white housefor many conservatives sessions’ early endorsement of trump served as an ideological touchstone and sessions has remained stalwart in carrying out trumpist policies at justice that trump could out of personal pique treat him so rudely now suggests to those conservatives how cynically expedient was trump’s adoption of sessions’ ideas in the first placebut beyond character and beyond ideology lies the most appalling aspect of the sessions affair  reviving the idea of prosecuting clintonin the  campaign there was nothing more disturbing than crowds chanting “lock her up” often encouraged by trump and his surrogates after the election however trump reconsidered saying he would not pursue clinton who “went through a lot and suffered greatly”now under siege trump has jettisoned magnanimity maybe she should be locked up after allthis is pure misdirection even if every charge against clinton were true and she got  years in the clink it would change not one iota of the truth  or falsity  of the charges of collusion being made against the trump campaignmoreover in america we don’t lock up political adversaries they do that in turkey they do it and worse in russia part of american greatness is that we don’t criminalize our politicslast week trump spoke at the commissioning of the uss gerald r ford aircraft carrier ford was no giant nor did he leave a great policy legacy but he is justly revered for his decency and honor his great gesture was pardoning richard nixon an act for which he was excoriated at the time and which cost him the  election it was an act of political selfsacrifice done for precisely the right reason nixon might indeed have committed crimes but the spectacle of an expresident on trial and perhaps even in jail was something ford would not allow the country to go throughin doing so he vindicated the very purpose of the presidential pardon on its face it’s perverse it allows one person to overturn equal justice but the founders understood that there are times rare but vital when social peace and national reconciliation require contravening ordinary justice ulysses s grant amnestied technically paroled confederate soldiers and officers at appomattox even allowing them to keep a horse for the plantingin trump world the better angels are not in evidenceto be sure trump is indeed examining the pardon power for himself and his cronies charles

than you think kenneth r harney · jul     pm washington  so what does it take to get approved for a mortgage to buy a house this summer whether you’re a firsttimer planning to move up or downsize maybe not all that you thinkfor most people the key requirement is that you’ve got the right package of stuff  acceptable credit score down payment financial reserves debttoincome ratio  to get an acceptable grade from the automated underwriting systems or “black boxes” installed at the dominant investors in the market fannie mae and freddie macthough the intricate webs of algorithms and big data spun inside fannie’s and freddie’s black boxes are kept under tight security we do get monthly readouts on some of the characteristics of loans they’re approvingfor example in june the average fico credit score for home purchase loans at fannie and freddie was  that’s a big reach for millions of wouldbe buyers it’s well above the national average fico score of  and considerably higher than what was typical during much of the previous two decades fico scores range from  to  with higher scores indicating lower risk of default but that’s not the whole picture according to data newly compiled by ellie mae a mortgage origination software and analytics firm that tracks loan characteristics substantial percentages of applications are receiving approvals from fannie and freddie with lower fico scores than you might imagine nearly  percent of their approved loans in june had scores between  and  scores like these are typical of consumers who have moderate dings in their national credit bureau files or are recovering from credit woes suffered during the great recession but are now bouncing back another  percent of loans approved had even lower ficos ranging from the low ’s to  mortgages backed by the federal housing administration fha closed in june spanned an even broader range of scores fha’s average score for home purchase loans was  but more than one out of four  percent of its borrowers had scores from  to  just under  percent had scores fha considers the rock bottom it will allow   to   indicating serious derogatory items in applicants’ credit files possibly even previous mortgage defaults or foreclosures note that fha uses its own proprietary underwriting system known as total which often yields more generous decisions on approvals than fannie’s or freddie’sdebttoincome dti ratios are another major factor hardwired into the black boxes  and can be dealbreakers in mortgage applications that otherwise look pretty good dti refers to the ratio of your monthly creditrelated expenses  including current rent mortgage payments credit cards student loans and the like  compared with your monthly gross income if you have  in income and  in total debt payments your dti is  percent fannie’s and freddie’s average dtis look strict but there’s actually more wiggle room for mortgage applicants this summer than any time in recent years the average dti for fannie and freddie during june was  percent fha which tends to be more forgiving on debt matters had average dtis in june of  percent but fannie freddie and fha recognize that even solid creditworthy applicants can be carrying high debt loads in the current economy and they are open to higher dtis than the monthly statistics suggest in an important policy change taking effect this month fannie raised its permissible maximum dti to  percent a study released last week by the urban institute predicts that this change alone could open the mortgage door to  additional home buyers that’s potentially a big splash freddie mac has had flexibility on dtis built into its underwriting system for years and also can go to  percent ideally for borrowers with compensating factors such as a higher down payment or high bank reserves fha is by far the most liberal of the three on dti funding loans with total debt loads in excess of  percentdown payment requirements also are super low at the moment fannie and freddie both have programs that permit just  percent down and some lenders using those programs have cut that to  percent or even zero fha’s minimum down is  percentbottom line

ruben navarrette jr · jul     pm san diego  what’s the date today don’t ask the media or the white house neither of them has the foggiest idea they’re both stuck in november  and curiously neither wants to admit it  even though they’re both quick to accuse the other of being needlessly mired in the past and inexplicably intent on replaying the presidential election in a recent example as part of his unrelenting campaign to create a hostile work environment for the nation’s chief law enforcement officer president trump tweeted “attorney general jeff sessions has taken a very weak position on hillary clinton crimes where are emails  dnc server  intel leakers”unbelievable do you know what’s really weak trump’s memory he’s the one who as presidentelect took off the table the idea of prosecuting clinton  either for mishandling classified emails or allegedly using the clinton foundation and the state department to shake down foreign donors cutting off his options was a dumb move for someone who is always telling us how smart he is over the past week much of broadcast media have hammered trump for being stuck in time and obsessing too much over an election that occurred almost nine months ago but these talking heads have no room to talk they’re just as guilty of constantly revisiting the  election if only to better understand what the heck happened the rules to this game are quite simple if dwelling on the election makes you look good or your opponent look bad then by all means do it but if recounting those events makes you look bad or your opponent look good then you want no part of it and so when trump spent much of his first  days in office bragging about his wellorchestrated victory over hillary clinton many in the media yelled “foul” how uncouth for the victor to be such a poor winner they said the message to the president was clear focus on the present and get on with governing there were also the questions about whether the trump campaign colluded with vladimir putin and the russian government to steal the election from clinton the questions sprang from denial and disbelief as a media that had lost touch with everyday americans refused to accept that trump had anything to sell that anyone would want to buy and as the media hounds searched for the russian connection the trumpistas certainly did themselves no favors by continuing to act guilty even as they proclaimed their innocence and so when donald trump jr released personal emails about meeting with a russian lawyer in the final months of the campaign the media treated the story as a smoking gun some of them even saw it as vindication of their claim that the badly run clinton campaign may not have been so badly run after all in fact for analysis on the story cnn turned to one of its newest contributors  robby mook clinton’s  campaign manager obviously these folks are not big on subtlety now who’s living in the pastas this tacky telenovela continues let’s be clear why the media hate trump so much it’s not just partisan bias a center for public integrity survey in october found that  percent of political donations from media figures in last year’s general election went to clinton and it’s not just foolish pride and the fact that as i have noted too many in the media can’t get over the fact that they missed the big story of trump’s victory it’s also the fact that  consistent with the old adage that we despise most in others the characteristics we see in ourselves  trump and broadcast media are the same animal both have narcissistic instincts and take themselves too seriously both love the sound of their own voice and dismiss opposing views both relish going on the attack but have thin skins and take criticism personally both know how to make lots of money from shrewdly marketing a brand both worship at the altar of mass communication and understand the power of mega soapboxes to shape public opinion and advance political agendas and most of all both

– it’s something we all do in the morning and at night – wash our faces feeling fresh often begins with a clean face “it definitely is very important that we wash our faces twice a day and when we do that we’re trying to remove all the impurities from lotions make up sunscreen and environmental pollution as well” said dr susan obagi a dermatologist and plastic surgeon with upmc women often wash their faces to remove makeup and before applying sunscreen or moisturizer dr obagi says how you wash your face is equally as important as what you use to cleanse it with so many products on the market how does one choose “for most patients anything that foams up on the skin is a good cleanser” said dr obagi “if it can foam and remove your makeup and remove your oils in one step” a product becoming more popular is micellar water it’s often advertised to remove makeup clean and moisturize all in one step “micelles in general are things that we know about from chemistry these are little round balls of oils or lipids so if you take that micellar water and drop it in a cup water you’ll see the little oil droplets form on top” dr obagi said dr obagi says the micelles or oil droplets suspended in water attract makeup and dirt on the face “what that does when you apply it to the skin it will bind to your makeup and it will help remove that makeup in one swipe and because it’s oil based it leaves behind a surface coat of oil on the skin that makes you feel hydrated” dr obagi said kdka asked dana a busy mom of two to try micellar water “i can see right now that it’s taking some of my makeup off” she said looking at the makeup residue on a cotton ball about her skin dana said “it feels very wet not oily which i was thinking it may be more oily” could micellar water be a replacement for your daily facial cleanser dr obagi says no “no because what the micellar water is doing it’s binding everything it can bind that will hold on to oil “dr obagi said “so it will remove your makeup it may remove some of your oil form your skin but it’s leaving behind a sheen of oil” “it just cleaned my skin and left it feeling soft and moisturized it feels moisturized” said dana the oil that micellar water leaves behind said dr obagi can block other products like antiaging creams from penetrating the skin “if you start wiping your skin with the micellar water for example and it leaves that oil sheen on the surface you’re going to have trouble with that skin care regimen penetrating the way we want” dr obagi said “if i were to use it” said dana “i think i would use it only if i didn’t have the time to do my full face routine i like a little deeper of a moisturizer especially at night” the doctor recommends using the micellar water if you’re on the go but not as a daily facial cleanser and moisturizer “i’m a purist” said dr obagi “i love people to cleanse their skin well i love people to cleanse their skin well and then to apply whatever they need to after that to a clean palate” “it’s just an easy way to wash your face and feel clean without having to use water” said dana join the conversation on the kdka facebook page stay up to date follow kdka on twitter lisa
