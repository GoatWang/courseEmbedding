contributor to join the discussion  find out howjack smithjacksmith · serial entrepreneur  startup adviserthis seems interesting and with interesting tech great design its a shame about the minimum order  of  units though as a small studio or  bed likely wouldnt need that amount i tried out eero but ultimately couldnt justify the price my current setup is a mesh networked setup using openmesh base units i networked my entire  sqr foot apartment using  base units for  half the cost of x ap from eero open mesh does have a steeper technical curve eero was quite plug and play and eero did make

want to check out unifi sometime as well upvoteshare·a year agojack smithjacksmith · serial entrepreneur  startup adviseretc ive had unifi at a previous office i think theres a bit more of a learning curve in terms of setup also for a housing environment the open mesh devices that i have are about  or rd the size of the unifi devices so much more discreet theyre also cheaper upvoteshare·a year agoetcooketcjacksmith are you sure thats still the case from what i see the unifi aps ac pro are half the price of their open mesh equivalents  vs  the open mesh software is definitely more capable through the interface but unifi does have some interesting features including zero handoff and effective band steering not advocating either solution  but ive been pretty happy with the solution after testing out a few alternatives thanks for the feedback upvoteshare·a year agojack smithjacksmith · serial entrepreneur  startup adviseretc i got some of aps that they had on sale or something so were only  each i think they still sell them they run only on the ghz channel not ghz they also have band steering in the beta version of their firmware id say the size is the main impact though the unifi aps would look stupid in my place the tiny open mesh aps are really discreet even if i just put them in the corridor for business id recommend unifi for home maybe open mesh or this plume thing if its any good eero is the best that i tried if money is no issue and you just want the best speed upvoteshare·a year agofahri dinermakerfdiner · ceo plumejacksmith the pod minimum is during the preorder

hooverrrhoover · founder product huntim digging the minimal design how does this compare to eero fdiner share·a year agojack smithjacksmith · serial entrepreneur  startup adviserrrhoover the main difference would seem to be the larger number of access points and the auto channel hop which sounds quite innovative share·a year agoavery haskellaveryhaskell · stanford computer sciencerrhoover seconded upvoteshare·a year agodhruba adhikariacpmasquerade · product director picovicojacksmith rrhoover also the price per unit seems to be much cheaper upvoteshare·a year agojack smithjacksmith · serial entrepreneur  startup adviseracpmasquerade but that becomes irrelevant if you need  plumes to  x eeros but yeah if youre getting x for  then thats likely potentially cheaper overall upvoteshare·a year agodhruba adhikariacpmasquerade · product director picovicojacksmith yup either way its cheaper even when eeros require you to buy  units plume wants  apart from that plume claims to have worked on protocol layer as well upvoteshare·a year agofahri dinermakerfdiner · ceo plumegreat question rrhoover while the latest generation of multirouter systems improve signal strength they can choke overall system capacity and speeds they are based on decadesold technology  mesh  that compounds the issue of a central router and cannot handle the complex variables and loads affecting a wifi network in a modern connected home we haven’t built plume on mesh technology as it can’t for example support even a simple thing like allowing each access point to use a different channel a plume network constantly self optimizes it switches channels based on external interference intelligently hands off mobile devices from room to room and can even boost bandwidth to a certain part of the house based on knowing how a device is being used a basic mesh system focused solely on signal coverage can’t do that that’s why we uncoupled the compute part of the router and put it in the cloud and let all the important decisions be made there it means our pods can be smaller and cheaper while the unlimited power of the plume cloud can intelligently monitor your home wifi and adapt accordingly we benchmarked plume against practically everything on the market – no other solution comes close share·a year agovinay patankarvinayp · ceo process street angelpad alumjacksmith acpmasquerade rrhoover its not much more than the google onhub and it seems it would get better coverage as ive lived in long apartments where the onhub wouldnt quite reach to the other side upvoteshare·a year agoadam geringadamgering · ceo of uncommon socialfdiner rrhoover uh oh that sounds very innovative putting intelligence in the cloud but risky if its required to operate this means the wifi network could stop working upon loss of wan connectivity and also if plume discontinues service for any reason end of life out of business acquired etc share·a year agofahri dinermakerfdiner · ceo plumeadamgering rrhoover good question if wan goes down completely plume remembers the most recent configuration and your wifi network continues to operate for your local devices like printers etc if wan slows down plume optimization keeps on ticking while we all love to hate our isp the reality is most of them today do a great job of keeping broadband up  httpswwwfccgovreportsrese and the upstream network resources compute storage etc have very high availability figures  httpscloudharmonycomstatus so bottom line  no worries share·a year agokumar thangududatarade · technologistwhy isnt wifi reliable id like to understand why from an analog rf design engineers perspective as well as try to understand how plume arbitrages a multibillion dollar business with tons of electrical engineers who try to build high performance products what is it that the key players are all missing out on that your startup understands as in whats the tradeoff i think deep problems and solutions require deep context share·a year agodieter shirleydete · old salt axiom zendatarade from what i can tell plume is doing a couple of interesting things that most other folks arent trying  many more small antennas more widely spaced i think a lot of routers start from the assumption that you need to optimize the case for a single basestation plume starts from the assumption that you have one antenna per room  compute in the cloud the entire systems configuration is constantly being adapted via the cloud analysis fdiner talk above how the individual antennas change their channel but the interesting part is that those channel choices are being driven holistically for the whole system and not each antenna trying to optimize individually at the end of the day well have to see how it plays out in the real world but the wifi situation in a lot of places including both my home and my office is not solved maybe plume hasnt solved it either but its a novel new approach that looks more radical than all the other attempts ive seen including eero id have an order in already if they shipped to canada share·a year agofahri dinermakerfdiner · ceo plumedatarade wireless in general and wifi in particular an unlicensed spectrum is an indeterministic medium  the environment constantly changes due to varying loads congestion interference fading etc current offerings are largely fixed solutions trying to solve a varying problem the result today as the sum of the two is a varying inconsistent quality of experience plume is a dynamic adaptive selfoptimizing approach thats intended to offer a constant high quality of experience we leverage the amazing work the industry is doing in the silicon and rf level  plumes technical contributions to the industry are largely in software
