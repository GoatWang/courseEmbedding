years seeking his own brand of vengeance his tale begins in  when hes recruited to provide cover for a fledgling american intelligence operation that will lead to the attempted assassination of a menacing tyrant named adolf hitlerthe younger danforth figures to stand squarely with the good guys but the real world of espionage seems beyond him until he meets a secretive and beautiful young spyintraining anna klein the mystery of anna lures danforth to break from his pampered life and join her on the dangerous mission within germany to kill hitler its a thrilling time for danforth alone with the girl he believes will give him a more dangerous but fulfilling love and life then the attempt fails and danforth must flee leaving anna behinddanforth must find her throughout the war and beyond he embarks on a rabid and marathon quest that costs him nearly all anna might have been a double or even triple agent he learns and his pursuit takes him to postwar europe and points east a grim survey of the tragedies of twentiethcentury europeas more cruel questions confront danforth his search descends into an obsession with extracting vengeance at all costs people have betrayed him could anna have been at the heart of it allthe best espionage and mystery novels are not about spies and plots and murders but about conflicted souls and the sorry truths they discover about the human condition quest offers fine glimpses of that though the story may stall some readers looking for a fastpaced spy tale the framed narrative creates many switches in time the first third can be slow going as danforth sets up his story and it carries waves of foreboding and foreshadowingsticking with danforth will reward the reader the last third moves faster and approaches the quality of espionage masters le carré furst and mccarry yet with a profound style all its own author thomas h cook knows when its time to unleash the raw story he gives you no choice but to follow danforth as he hurtles on through dark times that threaten to make him far from a savior and just another hopeless victimthis is cooks first go at an espionage novel it seems a unique angle for a spy story to have danforth plow onward like a dogged and selfappointed detective but its not unfamiliar territory for cook who has had a long and successful career writing crime and mystery novelsthe way the storys told might split some opinions but few can deny the novels thoughtful and compelling lesson about vengeancea longer version of this review ran originally in the noir journal blog read more sort by

novel for a muture and seasoned readerbymax readon august  format kindle editionverified purchasethe quest for anna klein was written by thomas h cook the book is an espionage mystery novel with a historical setting this is one of several books written by cook he received the best novel edgar for the chatham school affair as well as the martin beck award the herodotus prize for best historical short story and the barry for best novel for red leavesthe writing style is conversational questions answers and a tale are woven into alternating time periods  present and past the prose is rich in structure and salted with moral and philosophical ideology the setting begins in america and europe circa  when germany and hitler was rising to powerthe tale is about one thomas jefferson danforth son of a well to do importer living in new york city primed by his best friend robert clayton the unfulfilled and callow young danforth gets caught up in a plot of espionage that the conspirators name the project as danforth is progressively drawn in by clayton clayton introduces him to anna klein a spy in training needing a location for training anna klein clayton convinces danforth to provide his summer house in connecticut winterset for that purposeas danforth observes annas training he is slowly and inevitably attracted to her finally abandoning his current life to follow her to europe as a coconspirator in the project after arriving in europe and initially completing some surveilance the project is abandoned and a different more ambitious conspiracy is hatched before this new plan can be implemented a traitor exposes the conspirators anna klein is captured and taken away danforth is released this begins danforths life long quest to find anna klein and to reveal and kill the traitorthe tale from here takes many twists and turns and danforths steadfast resolve is slowly broken by the truths he invariably discovers truths that are sometimes stark for he knew the question had never been whether he would live or die for that had been decided long ago danforths struggle to confront his lost life and find meaning in his quest is brought to the reader as the final pieces of the puzzle are exposedi thought the book was quite good i imagine that the prose and style would appeal to a mature and seasoned reader as i would also imagine that a lessor student would find the reading tedious my knowledge of events names and places often forming a part of the novel backdrop was not polished and i felt i missed some of the historical drama the author intended however i felt that if you have the steadfastness to read the entire novel you should not be disappointed i found at least one instance where i had to go back and reread a passage as the linkage a  pages or so between a name kulli demirand the character was lost to me there was also one mystery that seemed to leave an open questionwhy did alma give paul the necklessall and all i would recommend this novel
