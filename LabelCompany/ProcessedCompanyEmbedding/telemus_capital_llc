telemus capital turns to retail exec as it steps up expansionby tom henderson twitterfacebooklinkedingooglecommentsemailprinterfriendly version finance retail technology finance extra expansions investing mergers and acquisitions venture capital talent telemus capital partners llc more  lloyd perlmutter southfieldbased telemus capital partners llc has hired lloyd perlmutter the former ceo of gap canada inc to be coo as the wealth management firm embarks on an ambitious expansion to grow from  billion under management to  billion over the next five to  yearsthe strategy calls on both geographic expansion and reaching out to new types of customers partner and cofounder lyle wolberg said telemus is in serious negotiations to buy wealth management firms in detroit ann arbor los angeles and florida the other part of the growth strategy is to market to the growing tech community in detroit and ann arbor — and bring on as clients company founders or executives who are younger than telemus typical client and have far less investable income than what the firm generally requires telemus has had a minimum threshold of investable assets for new customers of  million with the average client having  million or more now though telemus will take on clients with a small fraction of that  million minimum provided they are the kind of successful entrepreneurs who telemus execs think can evolve into a much more affluent customer sandy kronenberg who founded an it company in  is the poster child for what telemus hopes to accomplish in  as an exception to its rule telemus took him on as a customer when he had far less than  million to invest when kronenberg sold his company in  he suddenly — and easily — fit the traditional profile to manage the accounts of younger customers telemus has hired younger investment advisers bringing on five ages  in recent months but while those younger lessaffluent customers build their investment base it will be a geographic expansion that fuels telemus growth plans wolberg said whats the best way to get to  billion by taking a company from being a regional powerhouse to having a national presence he said telemus will target wealth management firms run by veterans of the industry who may be thinking of retiring or putting a succession plan in place wolberg said telemus acquisitions will be funded in part by new york citybased focus financial partners llc a wealth management firm with more than  billion under management last august focus financial bought a minority stake in telemusthey have more than a  million line of credit with eight or  national banks that we can draw on wolberg said in february telemus began its current expansion by buying los angelesbased concentric capital llc which focuses on clients in sports and entertainment for an undisclosed amountin  telemus made its first acquisition of ann arborbased beacon investment cowolberg and his cofounders chairman gary ran and robert stone wanted to bring in a coo with a background in managing growing retail businesses while at gap canada from  to  perlmutter grew its business from  million a year to  billion lyle wolberg after leaving the gap he ran retail operations for several canadian companies including indigo books and music inc clothing for modern times ltd and mexx canada co he has been in retailing his whole career founding a company called beaver canoe after graduating from harvard university and building it to  locations before selling it to target canadawolberg said telemus partners wanted to continue concentrating on investment strategies and wealth management and leave to someone else the daytoday problems of managing a growing business with more and more officeslloyd is a perfect fit for us wolberg said we didnt want to hire someone inside the financial services industry with his retail background he can bring in a fresh set of eyes to look at the client experience said perlmutter its in my bloodstream i wake up every day thinking about customers my focus will be on improving the client experience improving our inhouse processes bringing consistency to our operations as we grow and using technology which is underutilized as a driver telemus growth strategy is sound said jim fitzgerald president of birminghambased munder capital management inc in april munder announced it was being acquired by clevelandbased victory capital holdings inc in a  million deal that was expected to close in the third quartermunder primarily serves institutional investors telemus serves highnetworth individuals which makes a coo focused on the client all the more important fitzgerald said institutional investors he said dont need as much handholding tom henderson   email protected twitter tomhenderson
