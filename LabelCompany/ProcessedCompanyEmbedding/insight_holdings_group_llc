milestones to achieve success for longer term more than a month or more complex projects it is recommended that you use milestones to improve project outcome milestones serve as checkpoints that allow you to gauge progress and receive essential feedback we often link compensation to completing key milestones allowing you better control while motivating the team to yield higher quality work it is
