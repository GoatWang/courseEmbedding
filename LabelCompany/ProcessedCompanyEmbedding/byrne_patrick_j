accommodating after discussing with him my facial skin issues i have very elastic skin that continues to stretch over time creating small rolls of skin on my face and neck we agreed to a conservative game plan that not only gave me strong confidence in his ability to perform the surgery but also a sense of comfort with the surgical approach and followon support dr dufresne respected my thinking about the surgical procedure prior to surgery and cared about meeting my needs both surgically and postoperational support his surgical nurses are friendly and professionally topnotch the surgical results were incredible and provided me renewed confidence with a new lease on life he is honest and was able to accomplish what other surgeons believed was difficult to achieve it is easy to see why dr dufresne is viewed by his peers as an extraordinary plastic surgeon should there ever be a hall of fame for plastic surgeons i strongly believe that through dr dufresne’s demonstrated extraordinary results in my surgery as well as his renowned achievements in reconstructive surgeries illustrated in text books and documentaries he would be a firstballet inductee i am so happy that i found the

good ratings she discriminates on her patients and doesnt allow the patient to voice their concerns she is very short tempered authoritative and unforgivingi wish the best of luck to her because this

as your symptoms if youre feeling sick its also important to inform them if you have medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit like current medications or medical recordsfrom here the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you during your call its important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit this information will help

yourisksdoctors see a number of patients in a day sometimes in minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand this can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations and they can end up missing certain problem indicators while some problems like a cold or flu can be diagnosed in this time more complex ailments require attention which takes up time reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demandsurgery has some more dire risks attached to it so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure if a patient has a reaction to anesthesia it can cause very serious complications but this is an uncommon occurrence blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery often caused by inactivity during recovery infections numbness scarring swelling and death are all possible but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery youre undergoing talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potentialaftercaresurgery affects people in different ways but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia youll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have the nurse will tell you how the procedure went what effect it will have on your condition what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal if you start feeling pain the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse when possible its also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs this can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot some surgeries are outpatient procedures where people are released the same day for major surgeries patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bringrecovery and followupyour recovery time and followup expectations will vary depending on your procedure for example you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heartvalve surgery your surgeon will give you a list of things that youll need to do during this time including what medications to take and when youll be able to get back to work and other activitiesevery surgery will have a followup call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health if you have a major operation like heart surgery its important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected these appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on we just redesigned ypcom do you like it× likenot a fan× thank youfeedback
