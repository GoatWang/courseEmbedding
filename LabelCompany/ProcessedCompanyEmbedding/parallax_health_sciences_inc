to commercialize the proprietary testing system and test in a worldwide domain parallax diagnostics is currently prerevenue and continues to pursue viable opportunities for the commercialization of its product the company has sought to identify strategies that would make its proposition more valuable and competitive to this end the company has pursued the creation of patents around its foundational technology and developed a novel immune status test targeting the hivaids and tb markets since the inception of parallax diagnostics the novel cdcd immune status test has been developed and the company has been issued patents on elements of its core technology and testing system in  parallax identified an opportunity to acquire roxsan pharmacy inc roxsan a california corporation and began the due diligence process the companys initial interest centered on utilizing the acquisition as a means of accelerating the commercialization of the parallax target system and diagnostic platform as roxsan had access to a nationwide network of doctors and sales representatives during the due diligence process the company became aware of the numerous opportunities that roxsan and its markets represented on march   the company entered into a letter of intent with shahla melamed roxsans sole shareholder to acquire roxsan between  and  four  amendments were also executed as part of the acquisition the company was required to obtain licensure from the state of california and on july   the company received notice that its pharmacy and sterile compounding licenses were issued by the california state board of pharmacy on august   the closing date pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors the board the company entered into an agreement to purchase and sell one hundred percent of the issued and outstanding shares of roxsan pharmacy inc roxsan or the pharmacy and its assets and inventory the purchase agreement pursuant to the purchase agreement between the company roxsan and its sole shareholder shahla melamed the seller or melamed in exchange for  of roxsans common stock and its assets and inventory the company among other things issued the seller a secured promissory note the note dated august   in the amount of  million the acquisition the note bears interest at a rate of  per annum and matures in three  years or august   maturity principal and interest payments on the note will be made to the seller on a quarterly basis beginning with the threemonth period ending november   in an amount equal to   during the first two  years and   during year three  of certain of the pharmacys earnings defined within the purchase agreement as ebitda all remaining principal andor accrued interest if any still owing after three  years shall be paid in full to the seller at maturity the company is seeking a reduction in the purchase price and related promissory note see legal proceedings table of contents as a result of the acquisition effective august   roxsan became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company no change in control of the company occurred as a result of the acquisition in connection with the acquisition the company entered into an employment agreement the employment agreement with the seller under the employment agreement melamed agreed to provide exclusive consulting services to the company in the areas of public relations and marketing for a term of four  years on march   the company terminated the employment agreement in accordance with paragraph  termination for cause see dispute with former owner below the termination was the result of among other things melameds breaches in the agreement which were substantiated by an investigation conducted by an employment law firm retained by roxsan under the terms of the agreement no financial obligation resulted in the termination dispute with former owner shortly after the closing the companys management and melamed clashed over control of the roxsan pharmacy business operations and bank accounts faced with melamed continuing to materially interfere with the pharmacys operations to the detriment of its business the company retained the services of an employment law firm to investigate melameds actions and provide a report to the companys board the report the company also placed melamed on a paid leave of absence because of her actions the board after reviewing the findings in the report found substantive cause for melameds termination and immediately sent melamed written notification of the companys intent to dismiss her for cause under the employment agreement melamed was provided with a thirty  day cure period however the company received no response of intent to cure from melamed or her counsel and no evidence of a cure was provided to the company as a result the board authorized melameds termination for cause on march   and on march   melamed was formally terminated in writing in the course of managements operation of the roxsan pharmacy and adherence to financial accounting standards board revenue recognition policies management became concerned with the absence of the claim processing for over  million of preclose workers compensation prescription revenues which melamed represented to the company prior to closing as being the vast majority of the high margin compound revenue in addition to the  million in preclose claims the pharmacy generated over  million after the change in ownership until the cfo alerted management of a serious and dramatic change in the receivables collection timetable the underpinning cash flow processes and the potential illegitimacy of the workers compensation revenues further the cfo was uncomfortable with recognizing the revenue as it was presented by melameds financial records and in the absence of any reasonable assurance of collectability of the workers compensation revenues the company established an allowance for doubtful receivables for the  million in postclose claims for which collectability was highly unlikely the company retained the services of a forensic workers compensation fraud specialist to determine the legitimacy of the preclose workers compensation revenues and related insurance claims as a result of this forensic review it was determined that these claims were essentially valueless as a result of these findings and undisclosed changes to the cash flow and quality of earnings that represented a majority of the revenue of the pharmacy the companys board deemed it necessary to demand a reduction in the terms of the sale and purchase agreement to more accurately reflect the true valuation of the company this was met with resistance on the part of the seller shortly thereafter in october  melamed initiated two  legal actions against the company in the superior court of the state of california county of los angeles west district shahla melamed v parallax health sciences inc action numbers sc  and sc  the matter in the matter action no sc melamed sought rescission of the august   purchase agreement rescission was sought on the basis that allegedly in order to acquire the pharmacy the company and its principals had allegedly defrauded melamed there had allegedly been a complete failure of consideration and a unilateral mistake was allegedly made on the part of melamed on march   the court ruled in favor of the company and issued that melamed is not entitled to rescission of the purchase agreement the ruling of the court stated that no fraud on the part of the company or its principals had been demonstrated the court further ruled that there had been no failure of consideration and that melameds entry into the agreement was not a result of a unilateral mistake on the part of melamed the minutes of the ruling were entered by the county clerk on march   the company has likewise initiated legal action against melamed and filed an action in the superior court of the state of california county of los angeles west district parallax health sciences et al v shahla melamed et al case number sc  the complaint in that action alleges that melamed has breached several obligations under the purchase agreement and the company is seeking to reduce the secured note due to undisclosed material changes in the business subsequently filed pleadings by the company and roxsan in case number sc  allege among other things that melamed misrepresented the true earnings and source of income for the pharmacy business and had engaged in a fraudulent and illegal scheme to ship medications to states where her pharmacy was not licensed prior to the sale of the pharmacy in the matter action no sc melamed alleges that the company is in default under the terms of the purchase agreement and secured note and the companys termination of melameds employment agreement the company firmly believes that it had adequate grounds to justify the termination of the employment that it acted within its rights and shall prevail in these proceedings all three  legal matters are currently pending purchase price dispute included in the acquisition agreement and as part of the negotiated purchase price were representations and warranties made by the former owner involving certain primary revenue streams and related contracts shortly after the closing however management discovered that these representations were substantially inaccurate andor completely false these inaccuracies and the improper disclosures andor omissions made by the former owner during negotiations would have significantly affected the purchase price and related note payable as a result among other things management has initiated legal action against the former owner to seek a reduction in the purchase price in addition management engaged a thirdparty to perform a valuation of the pharmacy utilizing revised inputs that more accurately reflected the pharmacys revenue streams as of the date of acquisition the valuation performed resulted in a fair market value of  to  million after careful consideration and based upon these significant differences management has determined that the purchase price and related promissory note of  million does not fairly represent the fair market value at the date of purchase the company has therefore applied a discount to the note of  million to reduce the purchase price and related note to its estimated fair market value of  million utilizing the higher value on the range of as a conservative measure the valuation performed does not include the effects of any liabilities the former owner omitted or damages caused to the company as a result of the former owner and her immediate family members connected to the pharmacy control of funds dispute for a period of time immediately after the closing of the acquisition the former owner would not relinquish control of the pharmacys bank accounts and collected the pharmacys incoming cash revenues refusing to transfer the funds to the new ownership furthermore when the company attempted to change the corporate records and signatories on the existing bank accounts the former owner disputed the changes resulting in approximately  in corporate funds being frozen and held for adjudication during this period the company was forced to request that the former owner pay the pharmacys operating expenses at no time after the company opened new accounts did the former owner cooperate with the transference or willingly relinquish control of the pharmacys operating cash flow or incoming cash revenues as a result an extensive reconciliation was performed to determine what amounts were collected and paid by the former owner and what amounts were due to the company the reconciliation resulted in over  owed to the company from the former owner the reconciliation and underlying documentation went under judicial review and on july   the company was notified that the results of the review were in favor of the company in the amount of  a judgment is pending for the order of  owed to the company from the former owner us postal service interference the former owner continued to interfere in the transference of control of the pharmacy by submitting change of address forms to the us postal service wherein the former owner diverted the pharmacy mail to her home address once this was discovered and rectified with the post office the former owner filed another change of address to divert mail to a post office box during these periods of time the former owner received check payments and negotiated the checks by opening up a bank account utilizing a dba roxsan pharmacy the company was able to identify some of the checks the former owner negotiated by directly contacting the payer and receiving copies of the cancelled checks with the former owners signature endorsement and account number on the check description of business the companys principal focus is on personalized patient care through the use of the companys pharmacy roxsan and eventually through the parallax diagnostics medical diagnostic testing platform capable of diagnosing and monitoring several health issues the company has the following two business segments retail pharmacy services rps and corporate retail pharmacy services rps the rps provides a full range of pharmacy services including retail compounding and fertility medications the rps generates net revenues primarily by dispensing prescription drugs both through local channels by direct delivery as well as mail order the rps also sells a wide assortment of general merchandise including overthecounter drugs beauty and cosmetics products seasonal merchandise and convenience foods through the companys pharmacy the pharmacy is fully licensed and qualified to conduct business in over  us states corporate the corporate segment provides management and administrative services to support the company and consists of certain aspects of the companys executive management corporate relations legal compliance human resources and corporate information technology and finance departments in addition the corporate segment supports the costs and operating expenses related to the continued development and exploitation of the companys proprietary medical diagnostic and monitoring platform and processes which remains the companys primary focus table of contents management parallax is led by experienced veterans from the healthcare technology finance and management fields the companys disciplined and organized approach is balanced by its optimism for the future and the opportunities present in the current healthcare market the parallax team is grounded in a belief that success in business is built on a combination of research planning and execution the parallax business model in  years healthcare has transitioned from a direct relationship between doctor and patient to one that has patients separated from their doctors by the introduction of a huge number of stakeholders ranging from health insurers employers pharmacy benefit managers imaging diagnostic testing lawyers specialist and a plethora of others the patient and healthcare provider both want the same thing information quality of service transparency value for their hardearned dollars and more time in their day parallax believes that its products and services can provide solutions that mitigate rising costs reduce waste in spending through transparency reduce the amount of unnecessary services and increase the health and wellness of patients before they are sick parallax has developed acquired and licensed multiple platforms proprietary and exclusive that provide services and products across the healthcare continuum these platforms are designed to allow for multiple points of reciprocal consideration through innovative business models that provide patients with increased quality of services and products at reduced cost of time and money they also provide healthcare providers with increased access to their patients the ability to deliver better and more efficient service and increase their income from the services they supply though parallaxs multiple operations are focused in separate vertical markets parallax has designed its business model to allow for crosspollination and reciprocal transfer of value at multiple points in their respective economic food chains the companys business operations generate revenue currently from its compounding retail and fertility business and through multiple economic models ranging from cash payment to insurance reimbursement to rebates from pharmaceutical companies operational structure and new business units management developed a system of operations that focused on differentiating unique business markets for roxsan services and developed additional areas of focus currently roxsan operates four distinct business units comprised of � � roxsan compound pharmacy compounding roxsan antiaging roxsan antiaging � � shortly after roxsans acquisition in august  management determined that there were several areas that required immediate attention pharmacy compliance management created the position of director of compliance at roxsan and put a senior pharmacist as the director management developed a strategic plan covering its regulatory compliance goals the first goal was to create foundational standard operating procedures in the filling processing and shipping of prescriptions under this program an audit report audit report was discovered that was previously discarded by the prior ownership as having no relevance as to the results of the findings in that audit this audit was part of a due diligence requirement imposed by the company upon the prior owner before the acquisition which was to have a thirdparty organization verify that the pharmacy was operating within compliance of state regulatory demands the audit report dated prior to the acquisition which was discovered in abandoned files indicated that several areas of operation of the pharmacy were in violation of the most fundamental compliance rules and strict warnings as to the consequences of what would happen to the pharmacys licenses if these areas were not immediately corrected no corrections to the most serious violations had been performed by the prior owner and the seller did not provide this material information while in due diligence prior to the acquisition all areas recommended in the report to be corrected were in fact implemented by the current ownership state pharmacy licenses the former owner had developed a welldocumented contentious relationship with the california board of pharmacy as well as a number of other states in which the previous owner was accused of regulatory violations there were states that had suspended roxsans licenses under the prior ownership to operate in their state the new management began an aggressive program in each state to appeal to the state pharmacy boards to reinstate the licenses it became apparent that many individual members on several state boards of pharmacy including the california board of pharmacy the nevada board of pharmacy and the arizona board of pharmacy had an extremely negative perception of ms melamed with the new management entering into the picture the negative perception became extremely positive toward roxsans new ownership and its new compliance program thus far roxsan has obtained pharmacy licenses in over  us states and is seeking to obtain licensing in the remaining states as a result of the efforts of new management all of these issues were corrected and the pharmacy is currently operating in an entirely new status of having great relations with each of the previously strained relationships with individual state boards of pharmacy pharmacy benefit management business the former owner had created a negative and challenging relationship with payers and pharmacy benefit management pbms as well as the cancellation of some pharmacy network contracts with pbm contracts that control the approvals for reimbursements for several health insurers the new management established a plan of action and sops to follow as well as address the criteria for contract reapprovals with the pbms roxsan pharmacy has become qualified and fully accredited member of focusscripts compounding pharmacy network enabling roxsan to participate in the pharmacy benefit management program for one of the largest health insurers in the united states as of this update approximately  of the compound pharmacys in the us have been able to achieve this accreditation a market development has occurred that has produced a payer reaction to the exorbitantly high pricing trends for compound pain medications that development has affected the viability of the compound pain medication management industry due to rejections and many of the ingredients becoming noncovered roxsan has developed a program to restructure the pharmacys approach to creating a more ethically based pricing structure with extraordinarily high efficacy formularies and is working with several of the industrys leading pbms in pursuit of partnership arrangements national accreditation in addition under the new management roxsan pharmacy passed the inspection from the verified pharmacy program vpp as part of the national association of the board of pharmacy this was a significant accomplishment considering that the prior ownership had failed in passing the vpp inspection in the past passing the vpp inspection is an exhaustive process requiring high levels of regulatory systems and compliance this extraordinary accomplishment was achieved in less than one year under the newly restructured operating compliance program under the new ownership which included strict adherence to documentation retention and categorization human resources in addition to the issues outlined above it was determined that there were also personnel issues that roxsans pharmacists technicians and general operations employees had with the prior ownership these issues involved compensation benefits and management style of leadership which lacked the opportunity for the employees to be empowered to effectively perform their duties management also addressed these issues with clarification of job responsibilities compensationbenefit adjustments including stock option incentives and an overall more inclusive and open communication style of management note the following sections of this annual report and any
