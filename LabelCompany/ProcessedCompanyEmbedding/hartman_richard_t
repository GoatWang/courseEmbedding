the team multimedia wilk news store sponsors press release  richard hartman team wilkerson adds richard hartman to lrs funny car crew posted by team manager bob wilber springfield ill january    tim wilkerson ownertunerdriver of the levi ray  shoup funny car has announced the addition of richard hartman to the organization hartman is a highly respected veteran of the sport who has enjoyed a lengthy career that spans nearly all aspects of nhra mello yello drag racing from crew chief to driver while he also mastered nearly every other position along the way born into a drag racing family hartmans career started at the age of eight when he began helping his father virgil hartman on the familys dragsters his sister rhonda hartmansmith and her husband john bodie smith have both driven professionally as well as a driver hartman claimed spots in the nhra funny car top  during consecutive seasons  and he was the sixth funny car driver to earn a berth in the prestigious castrol second club in  hartman began tuning in  and has spent the last four seasons as crew chief for top fuel driver terry mcmillen im thrilled to have richard join our program and im really excited about what he can bring to our race car tim wilkerson said theres basically not a thing on a fuel car that richard hasnt worked on built or analyzed from every direction and hes one of those talented guys who has done just about anything you can do in drag racing inside the cockpit and out this sport is one where nothing stays the same for very long and that includes the people you have on your team so when a couple of our guys moved on to different opportunities and richard was available i got him on the phone as fast as i could dial his number hell be a great addition as another set of eyes both in terms of helping with the tuneup and with the assembly of the car and hell bring a lot of other positive traits with him on top of all that hes going to be an important part of the lrs program as we move forward hartman brings a vast wealth of racecar knowledge to team wilkerson and hes equally as fired up to get the  mello yello season underway i am so excited to join tim and the lrs team i can hardly even put it into words hartman said tim has been one of my goto guys for many years and any time the race car would have me stumped in some way hed always take the time to talk with me and help me get it sorted out on top of that hes one of the allaround best people in this sport and ill be there to help in any way tim wants its been a long time since i was this pumped up about starting a new season and because were going to have some new faces on the team mine included im really happy that tim has committed to testing in phoenix two weeks before pomona well all have a chance to mesh a little as a team and get to know each other and well see how much good we can do on the track i know tim hasnt tested much the last few years because he saves his budget for the season so hopefully we can get a little edge and a headstart before we kick off the real racing in february i cant wait although consistency has been a prized asset at team wilkerson over the years its not uncommon for any team in the professional ranks to add new crew members before any given season and thats the case with team wilk for  were kind of like that lowbudget franchise that does a pretty good job developing talent but when they become free agents we have a hard time competing to keep them all here wilk said so we lost a couple of guys and are shifting a few guys into new roles but its nothing we havent gone through before and we have a good core in place having richard onboard will be a big asset for us as we try to gel a little and the guys get the chance to figure it out im hopeful that having richard with us might just get us over the hump a little bit in terms of winning rounds and winning races were fired up team wilk will be testing in phoenix at wild horse pass motorsports park during the weekend of january  the  nhra mello yello drag racing season will begin two weeks later february  at auto club raceway in pomona  executive biographies  toll brothers investor relations toll
