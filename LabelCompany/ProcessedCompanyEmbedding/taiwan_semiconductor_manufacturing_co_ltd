foundry industry are exposed to the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry during upturns tsmc must ensure that it has enough production capacity to meet strong customer demand however during downturns it must contend with excess capacity because of weaker demand and the high fixed costs associated with its manufacturing facilities as a result the companys financial results tend to fluctuate with a cycle time of a few years this is more apparent in earnings than revenues because of the general trend of revenue and capacity growth tsmcs business has generally also been seasonal with a peak in q and a low in q in  tsmc was at the forefront of the foundry industry for highperformance lowpower applications leading major smartphone chip companies such as qualcomm mediatek and apple to place an increasing amount of orders while the competitors in the foundry industry primarily globalfoundries and united microelectronics corporation have encountered difficulties ramping leadingedge  nm capacity the leading integrated device manufacturers such as samsung and intel that seek to offer foundry capacity to third parties were also unable to match the requirements for

answers contact us login search search report taiwan semiconductor mfg co ltd and samsung facing nano yield issues a report from digitimes says that both samsung and tsmc are facing lowerthanexpected manufacturing yield rates on its latest technology impacting product launch schedules ashraf eassa tmfchipfool mar   at pm contract chip manufacturers taiwan semiconductor mfg co ltd nysetsm and samsung nasdaqothssnlf both recently began mass production of chips using their respective nanometer chip manufacturing technologies both companies nanometer technologies allow chipmakers to build more densely packed meaning more features and higherperforming products two things that are generally good in the world of chips image source intel however according to a recent report from digitimes both tsmc and samsung are facing manufacturing yield issues with their respective nanometer technologies lets go over the implications of those yield challenges why are low manufacturing yields bad manufacturing yield refers to the percentage of manufactured chips that both work and meet the performance and power specifications mandated by the design it generally costs a fixed amount of money to manufacture a wafer of chips so the higher the yield rate the greater the number of chips are produced for a given cost which means lower effective perchip cost conversely low yield rates mean higher costs such costs can either be passed on to the customer the chip manufacturing company itself could eat the costs or the responsibility could be shared additionally chipmakers put in a certain amount of manufacturing capacity in anticipation of customer demand if manufacturing yield rates are too far below plan then a customer using the lowyielding technology may not be able to get ahold of sufficient supply of products so low manufacturing yields are generally bad for business specific impacts on tsmcs and samsungs customers the lead customer for tsmcs nanometer technology appears to be mediatek which is using this technology to manufacture its helio x line of premium smartphone chips in a statement to nikkei asian review a mediatek executive said that the x was delayed because the yield rate of  nanometer process technology from tsmc has not yet reached a satisfactory level and we are a bit stuck on that a silver lining here is that mediatek doesnt expect significant adoption of the x in premium smartphones saying that it expects the x to be used in less than  smartphone models so these yield challenges are unlikely to significantly disrupt mediateks business or the businesses of its customers for samsung and its lead customer mobile chipmaker qualcomm nasdaqqcom the struggle is more significant the samsung galaxy sseries devices that are set to be formally announced later this month are expected to samsungs exynos  for some variants and qualcomms snapdragon  in other variants both chips are believed to be manufactured by samsung using its nanometer lpe technology digitimes says that samsung delayed the rollout of the galaxy sseries devices due unsatisfactory yield rates how about the iphone apple nasdaqaapl is expected to tap tsmc to manufacture the formers upcoming a applications processor on the latters nanometer technology the bad news is that the yield challenges described by digitimes could impact apples ability to meet demand for its nextgeneration iphones the good news is that apples next iphone models arent expected to launch until the fall which gives both apple and tsmc additional time to work out the kinks on the nanometer technology furthermore some of the yield issues that mediatek may be seeing could be related to its underlying chip design rather than only due to tsmcs technology in that case theres a reasonable chance that apple wont face quite the yield problems that mediatek is apparently coping with ashraf eassa owns shares of qualcomm the motley fool owns shares of and recommends apple and qualcomm the
