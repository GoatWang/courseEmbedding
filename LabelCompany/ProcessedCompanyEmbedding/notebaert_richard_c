happy warrior eager to take on new challenges and to mingle with workers shareholders and customers to show them his vision of a bright future even during the most miserable of times a lowkey personality he had the common touch and would converse as easily with bluecollar workers as he did with corporate executives he was responsible for making ameritech one of the most successful baby bells companies spun off from att in an antitrust settlement he was credited with saving tellabs from dissolution and he staved off bankruptcy richard c notebaert apwide world photos  for qwest when the situation appeared hopeless although he was visionary in terms of what he foresaw his companies providing in services his business techniques were classic anticipate developments in the marketplace cut costs and organize a company around its customers needs the company man notebaerts career began while he was in college when he took a job washing trucks while in college he married peggy who was one of the anchors of his life throughout his sometimes tumultuous career he worked in both marketing and services during the first decade of his career at ameritech he began his rapid rise up the corporate ladder when he received his mba in  it was an opportune time to have earned an mba because att which had long held a monopoly on telephone communications in the united states was being broken up into a longdistance carrier and five new local phone companies one of the new local companies was ameritech corporation which received the states of illinois indiana michigan ohio and wisconsin as its territory notebaert quickly became the vice president of marketing and operations for ameritech communications one of the divisions of ameritech corporation when notebaert became president of ameritech mobile communications in  the cellular communications industry was just beginning to catch on through aggressive marketing he built the customer base of ameritechs cellular telephone division to  near the end of notebaerts tenure as president of indiana bell telephone company in february  william weiss ameritechs chief executive officer and chairman of the board held a special meeting of the companys management he had asked each attendee to write about what ameritech should be doing in the future and then had each read aloud his views during the meeting notebaerts presentation caught weisss attention with its expansive view of ameritechs possibilities advocating that the company develop video conferencing blend the internet telephones and televisions into one vast interactive service and offer quality of life services such as safety and security at age  notebaert was considered young by the standards of ameritech executives but in  weiss promoted him to president of ameritech services where notebaert put his ideas to work beginning a security monitoring service that would have  customers by  notebaert proved to be an excellent motivator of employees communicating with and inspiring even the lowest ranks through open communications and easy accessibility in january  weiss and the board of directors of ameritech named notebaert vice chairman of the board and in june  they named him president and chief operating officer of ameritech leaping him past many more senior executives during this period notebaert helped expand ameritechs international operations including telecom corporation in new zealand and belgacom in belgium ameritech played a crucial role in the creation of belgacom which was the first of belgiums government monopolies to be privatized when notebaert became president and ceo of ameritech in january  he took charge of a company that had  million local phone customers  million cellular customers and  billion in annual revenue notebaert wanted ameritech to have a share in the longdistance phone call market but a court ruling and government regulators both federal and state forbade the baby bell from selling longdistance services where it had a monopoly on local phone service weiss and notebaert had worked closely together to reorganize ameritechs corporate structure from five divisions by state to one in which the state operations were merged into a whole and then divided by product lines such as local telephone services and cellular services when weiss retired on april   notebaert added chairman of the board to his other offices notebaert hired marketing specialists to run the new divisions of ameritech and he changed ameritechs stodgy style of advertising that emphasized its stability and long heritage to one that targeted specific aspects of the marketplace such as small businesses emphasizing ameritechs hightech new services he worked with government regulators as partners not foes in opening the marketplace to competition notebaert pressed hard to have ameritechs local telephone territories opened to ameritechs longdistance telephone services and he took the daring step of opening ameritechs fivestate territory to local telephone competition att leaped at the chance and almost immediately began competing for the lucrative chicago local market notebaert hoped that the move to set aside ameritechs local telephone service monopoly in exchange for a competitive marketplace would encourage regulators and the courts to allow ameritech to compete for longdistance services this plan put rural telephone users at a disadvantage because urban telephone income had traditionally subsidized the lowprofit rural markets notebaert proposed a universal service fund that would help keep down rural telephone costs to consumers by having all american telephone companies contribute to it in spite of these efforts and proposals regulators refused to allow ameritech to offer longdistance services in the fivestate territory by the end of  ameritech had  employees and had operations in all  states and in  countries in  notebaert targeted economic development education and quality of life for ameritechs marketing he hoped to develop services that helped businesses process their sales electronically that helped people commute electronically by working at home and using telephone lines to connect them to their offices that helped students attend classes from home through a blend of telephones and computers and that enhanced the security of people through electronic alarms and swift contact of support and emergency services further he foresaw electronic government in which government business could be done with ameritech internet services—for example allowing lawyers to file court briefs electronically he also wanted voiceactivated telephones that allowed a caller just to say a name and have the telephone automatically dial the appropriate phone number when he found that the ameritech research and development team was trying to create a voiceactivated telephone with a capacity to understand  names but already had an inexpensive one that recognized  names he trimmed the research and sent the name telephone to market during  he cut about  jobs saving ameritech  million he asked regulators to allow ameritech to keep the savings because regulations at the time forced such savings to be passed on as lower telephone rates—a practice that discouraged corporate efficiency and encouraged bloated corporate bureaucracies in spite of ameritechs inability to offer longdistance services to its local customers the companys fortunes boomed during notebaerts tenure and he became a very rich man always busy in local affairs in chicago where ameritech was based he even donated  million to help build the peggy notebaert natural history museum in  it quickly became a prime destination for visitors to the city when ameritech was sold to sbc communications in  notebaert received a severance bonus of approximately  million ameritech had had five straight years of growth under notebaerts leadership with a  percent growth in revenues its market capitalization tripled to  billion notebaert sold ameritech to sbc for  billion a windfall for ameritechs shareholders making profits amid disaster at tellabs notebaert promised his family that he would take some time off from work and spend it with them but there seemed little doubt that he would take a job again in august  only  months after the sale of ameritech the board of directors of tellabs offered him the offices of president and ceo and he accepted the management had hopes of tripling its revenues in the next three years and the board of directors thought notebaert had what was needed to guide the company through expansion notebaert was known for his combination of creativity and steady leadership and ameritech had been a customer of tellabs which meant that notebaert was familiar with tellabs products tellabs manufactured parts for communications systems in  its revenues were  billion the dotcom revolution had spawned numerous companies that needed equipment for communications and for hosting web sites and the possibilities for electronics communications seemed limitless but in  the dotcom collapse began with hundreds of communications and internet companies going out of business surviving companies found themselves with overcapacity—more room for business than there was business to be had the decline in business meant that many tellabs customers had already purchased more tellabs products than they could use which in turn meant that tellabs lost business it had counted on tellabs was in danger of going out of business almost as soon as notebaert settled into his new positions during the first eight months of  he cut  jobs at tellabs including managers with  employees taking early retirement and the others being laid off they represented  percent of tellabs workforce the labor cuts saved tellabs  million notebaert himself cut his pay for  by  percent and took no bonuses revenues for the year were  billion down  billion from the year before in  notebaert continued to cut jobs reducing the workforce by a total of  percent from  when he first joined tellabs to  it was awful you hate firing people—nobody enjoys it—but we did what we had to do he asserted in   knight riddertribune news service  june   during notebaerts tenure at tellabs the companys stock dropped from  to  per share yet when he left the company he was praised by those who worked with him and he was credited not only with saving tellabs from extinction but also with making it profitable in  he had done whats right for the business as a whole he said  denverpostcom  june   and he left the company in sound financial condition although much smaller than it had been with  billion in cash reserves in the bank he had accomplished his goals in part by focusing tellabs on two profitable lines of products the titan optical products that helped networks interact and the cablespan line of cables used in electronic communications he aggressively pursued sales of tellabs products globally in  countries when it was announced that he was leaving tellabs the companys stock fell  percent in one day the challenge of qwest qwest was americas fourthlargest telephone company but it was in poor shape in  it had purchased the local phone service provider us west nicknamed us worst for its bad customer service at a cost of  billion thereafter the company was beset by problems although the true extent of the problems became known only after notebaert took over control and had the companys financial records examined during  and  qwests stock price fell  percent it had revenues of  billion in  but it also had  billion in debt it was being investigated by the us department of justice the federal bureau of investigation and the securities and exchange commission sec for falsifying financial reports and perpetrating underhanded schemes that made it look like it was earning money when it was not in one scheme qwest sold access to its telephone network to companies that then sold qwest access to their networks for the same amount of money meaning that no one actually made a profit however qwest entered the bogus sales into its financial books as income to inflate its reported revenues to fool investors into thinking qwest was doing better than it really was ceo joseph p nacchio began fishing around qwests yellow pages business to potential buyers to bring in enough money to stave off disaster qwest was on the verge of bankruptcy when notebaert joined it nacchio was a flamboyant leader who drew publicity to himself and his company and who had pursued an audacious expansion of qwest when the companys board of directors looked for a replacement they favored the lowkey manner and traditional economics represented by notebaert the board of directors offered notebaert  million in salary plus bonuses that would increase his annual income to  million and the directors offered him a  million bonus if he remained leader of the company until age  in may  rating agencies relegated qwests bonds to junk bond status yet notebaert may have relished taking leadership of a huge corporation and the challenge of setting it straight still it is unlikely that he realized just how badly off the company was when he became ceo and chairman of the board on june   and relocated to denver colorado home of qwests headquarters the company was in danger of collapse at any time during  its fiberoptics network alone was losing more than  million annually qwest stock rose  percent the day notebaert was hired in july  he removed five qwest executives from their posts and brought in three executives who had worked with him at ameritech oren g shaffer cfo at ameritech from  to  was made vice chairman at qwest joan h walker vice president of corporate communications at ameritech from  to  and senior vice president of global affairs for pharmacia in  when hired by notebaert became senior vice president of corporate communications and gary r lytle leader of ameritechs washington office from  to  became vice president of policy and law shaffer went quickly to work mending fences by visiting the sec accountant in charge of the secs investigation of qwest and by auditing the companys books he found  billion in phony income listed for  notebaert found himself in charge of a company of  us employees that saw a  percent decline in revenue from january to september  and therefore might not be able to meet its payroll fortune called qwest one of the biggest wrecks in america january   notebaert began campaigning among the rankandfile workers that summer traveling to meet them in groups usually small to tell them of the future he saw for qwest and to enlist their help asking wage earners to cut back on the hours they worked the companys  union members agreed to forego their scheduled  to  percent pay increases in exchange for performance bonuses in  notebaert opened permanent communication between himself and his employees on the basis of his good name notebaert persuaded bank of america to pull lenders together to lend qwest  million to stave off immediate bankruptcy in an action that notebaert later said he had never done before and hoped never to do again he pressed qwest bondholders to forgive much of the debt owed to them he did this by noting that qwest could go bankrupt and that those who agreed to exchange their bonds for bonds worth  percent less would be placed at the head of the line of investors who would be paid first from qwests assets implying that those bondholders who did not exchange their notes might get nothing at all if the company died this tactic angered bondholders but enough of them accepted the offer to reduce qwests bonded debt from  billion to  billion in  some bondholders sued qwest over the bond restructuring by the end of  notebaert had reorganized qwests corporate structure into three units business customer services general consumer services and wholesale marketing he tried to extend qwests longdistance services to the old us west local service territories but as at ameritech regulators refused the plan as  began qwest had  million customers in  states a formidable customer base if qwest could dig out from under its debts but the company lost  percent of its customers from june  to june  due in may were  billion in debts that notebaert and shaffer managed to persuade debt holders to restructure into longerterm payments in  notebaert sold qwests yellow pages for  billion which was applied to debts both qwests  billion fiberoptics network of  miles of lines and its longdistance network in areas where qwest offered no local phone service were losing money and financial analysts suggested that qwest should sell them but notebaert saw them as part of a profitable future and insisted that qwest hang on to them he reduced the fiberoptics network from  servers to seven because the network was not receiving enough customers to use more than seven he then moved the fiberoptics network into the jurisdiction of the corporations business unit notebaert shaved off costs even further by cutting  jobs during  by the end of  qwest had lost perhaps  million for the year on  billion in revenue but had reduced its overall debt to  billion these results were achieved not only by cuts but also by new strategies notebaert changed the focus of business services from large corporations to midsize businesses exploiting a new for qwest market he formed a partnership with sprint for national wireless service giving qwest a big share of the cellular phone market part of his strategy rejected the possible sale of qwest and rejected the possible acquisition of smaller companies notebaert pursued alliances such as that with sprint to expand qwests markets without incurring more debts he placed emphasis on good customer relations and would pose as a consumer to call qwest customer service representatives to make sure they were delivering good service overall he gave his employees the impression that he was always involved in the companys daytoday business and that he cared about them and their work during  notebaert was appointed by president george w bush to the national security telecommunications advisory committee where he worked to establish standards for new communications technologies and to find ways to secure americas communications networks from sabotage by terrorists when notebaert accepted his appointments at qwest he and his wife moved from chicago to denver although they kept an apartment in chicago so that they could visit with family and friends in denver they were active in the united way and other local charities see also entries on ameritech corporation qwest

humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
