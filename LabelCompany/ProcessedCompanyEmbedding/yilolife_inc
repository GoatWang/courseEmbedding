yilolife inc crusades for medical marijuana mmj – networknewswire primary menu networknewswire twitter facebook linkedin rss feed skip to content networknewswire yilolife inc crusades for medical marijuana mmj on wednesday july   the senate judiciary subcommittee on crime and terrorism held a hearing on the potential medical benefits and risks of marijuana use while certainly a welcome sign of changing legislative attitudes toward marijuana the tenor of the hearing was cautious and sometimes combative it isn’t clear what steps if any the subcommittee will now take those who are likely to benefit from marijuana’s therapeutic effects shouldn’t hold their collective breath nevertheless the crusade to decriminalize marijuana use continues and campaigners like yilolife inc are in its vanguard testimony was submitted by three panels the members of which included sens kirsten gillibrand dny and cory booker dnj dr susan weiss phd director of the national institute on drug abuse’s division of extramural research dr douglas throckmorton md deputy center director of the fda’s regulatory programs dr daniele piomelli phd pharmd professor of anatomy and neurobiology at the ucirvine dr stuart gitlow md executive director of the american society of addiction medicine’s annenberg physician training program in addictive disease and mr d linden barber jd partner at quarles and brady llp dr weiss deferred to the fda saying that “rigorously conducted randomized trials are needed to confirm preliminary evidence suggesting the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids for a variety of conditions and symptoms additional clinical and basic research is needed to support the development of new medications” dr douglas throckmorton of the fda predictably said “the drug approval process represents the best way to help ensure that safe and effective new medicines including any such medicines derived from marijuana are available to patients in need of appropriate medical therapy” and he then went on to lay out that process the fda approval process consists of five stages firstly there are nonclinical tests on animals to determine drug toxicity secondly an investigational new drug ind application with the animal data is submitted thirdly phase i clinical trials to assess how to safely administer and dose the drug when used in small numbers of healthy volunteers commence fourthly phase ii studies explore the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication over a range of doses and determine shortterm side effects and finally in phase iii trials the longerterm effects of the drug involving several thousand subjects are observed dr daniele piomelli warned that thc “and other exogenous cannabinoids hijack the endocannabinoid signaling system leading to serious side effects” but nevertheless concluded that “promising opportunities for therapeutic intervention” remained dr stuart gitlow denied that medical marijuana exists he expressed concern that “descheduling marijuana ie removing it from the controlled substances act would simply encourage a ‘freeforall’ of marijuana products available to the public” all this is not very encouraging particularly as the drug enforcement agency dea missed its selfimposed june  deadline to decide whether to reschedule the drug and recognize its potential therapeutic value some believe that the present administration’s ‘just look the other way’ policy will put pressure on the agency to ease its restrictions although president obama himself has said that any decision to reschedule marijuana should be left to congress but it is to be borne in mind that the dea’s acting administrator chuck rosenberg is on record as saying “we can have an intellectually honest debate about whether we should legalize something that is bad and dangerous but don’t call it medicine” regardless mr d linden barber expressed confidence in the dea saying “while some have interpreted dea’s enforcement role and it historical enforcement actions involving marijuana as an indication that dea has an institutional bias against marijuana that has not been my experience” time will tell in the meantime yilolife inc continues its campaign at the state level the company recently announced its support with an initial donation of  for the campaign to regulate marijuana like alcohol “crmla” the

largest us banks host accounts for marijuana businesses says american banker palm beach fl january    a recent study commissioned by industry journal american banker reveals that the nation’s four largest banks have opened accounts for pot shops and marijuanarelated businesses this is good news for companies like cannabis science inc cbis eco science solutions inc essi medical marijuana inc mjna marijuana company of america inc mcoa mcig inc mcig and yilolife inc – all of which provide a variety of services or interest to the marijuana community and would benefit from commercial banking services conducted by mrb monitor a firm that helps financial institutions identify the risks associated with the marijuana industry the study examined public records in the state of massachusetts and found that  percent of businesses that filed to operate medical marijuana dispensaries in massachusetts between june  and september  had one or more accounts at bank of america citigroup wells fargo or jpmorgan chase if a similar pattern of working with the marijuana industry takes hold in washington dc and the us states that have legalized marijuana the prospect of financial services for cannabis outfits may not be as dire as it at first appears bank of america seems to have been the most accommodating over half of the marijuana businesses included in the survey had accounts at the bank though it previously told the statesman journal that “as a federally regulated financial institution we abide by federal law and do not bank marijuanarelated businesses” guidelines issued by federal authorities in  appeared to have offered financial institutions a legal avenue to provide their services to marijuanarelated businesses mrbs back then the financial crimes enforcement network fincen part of the us treasury department provided guidance it said was meant to “enhance the availability of financial services for and the financial transparency of marijuanarelated businesses” yet under the controlled substances act csa it is illegal to manufacture distribute or dispense marijuana and marijuana  like heroin lsd and ecstasy – remains a schedule  substance under the statute in december  us senator elizabeth warren dmass a member of the senate banking committee along with nine other senators sent a letter to fincen requesting guidance on how banking services might be offered to “indirect businesses” that “provide services to the statesanctioned marijuana industry” hopefully after nomination season comes to a close a response to that letter will be forthcoming there’s a lot at stake as arcview market research wrote “cannabis is arguably the fastest growing industry in the world regulated marijuana sales in north america totaled  billion in  a  percent increase from  sales are projected to increase to  billion by the year  representing a  percent compound annual growth rate” yilolife is gearing up to reap this burgeoning marijuana harvest the company recently

december    last month arizona narrowly rejected an initiative to legalize recreational marijuana use but supporters of legalization are not discouraged by the failed vote and are already mobilizing to find alternative ways for the substance to become fully legal statewide while a new proposition is being drafted for the next election an arizona lawmaker is considering a different approach that would get recreational marijuana use legalized through the state legislature if successful according to the tenth amendment center blog the bill was prefiled for introduction during the  legislative session by rep mark cardenas dlouisville and if it is passed it would mark a big step toward virtually annulling federal cannabis prohibition as well cardenas’s house bill  hb shares many similarities with proposition  which was rejected in the november election by a narrow margin  percent voted against recreational legalization and  percent voted in favor prop  was sponsored by the coalition for the regulation of marijuana like alcohol and supported by several dispensaries medical marijuana manufacturers and other organizations including yilolife inc a holding company the yilo™ branded product line represents popular topquality mmj products if successful hb would allow any individual age  or above to possess use display purchase consume or transport up to one ounce of marijuana or up to five marijuana plants and the cannabis produced by those plants at their location additionally any individual over the age of  would be permitted to transfer up to one ounce of marijuana and five immature marijuana plants to another person of legal age without remuneration the bill would also allow any individual of legal age to assist another person who is at least  in any of the acts listed above furthermore the bill would enforce an excise tax of  per marijuana ounce with half the revenue so collected going to the general fund and the other half going toward health and educational programs the department of health services would be tasked with regulating the recreational cannabis industry in the state while marijuana retailers and vendors would be required to register and get local and state officials’ approval for their business locations under hb if any individual under  is caught possessing up to one ounce of marijuana they would be required to either pay a fee of up to  or take part in a diversion program if the bill is successful during next year’s legislative session arizona will be the first state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana through its legislature instead of a ballot initiative process in addition passage of the bill would basically nullify the current federal prohibition on marijuana with the drug enforcement agency
