of a logo of tencent at the global mobile internet conference gmic  in beijing thomson reuters by yimou lee and paul carsten hong kongbeijing reuters  tencent holdings ltd is not only chinas largest social network and online entertainment firm it is now big in mobile payments too it has quietly built one of the worlds largest payments systems with transactions which could total more than  billion this year according to reuters calculations while most of tencents money still comes from online gaming it has also developed a hit mobile messaging app called wechat which had  million monthly active users at the end of december up from  million at the end of september and it is building new businesses on wechat including gaming social advertising akin to facebook incs  and mobile banking tencent does not disclose whether it is making money from its mobile payments business however tencents fourth quarterly earnings report on thursday which showed overall revenue grew at its quickest rate in three years and beat analysts estimates also revealed how much it paid banks in fees for customers sending each other money via wechat these fees which tencent chief executive pony ma said amount to  percent of each transaction were more than  million yuan in january that would mean such transactions on wechat payment totaled over  billion yuan  billion that month according to reuters calculations and this figure does not include transactions for popular services such as paying for taxis restaurants and online media like video games and music if that pace continues for the rest of the year tencent will see at least  trillion yuan  billion transacted across wechat payment in  that would make it almost twice as big as all of paypal holdings incs  billion in transactions in  wechat payment has also become a serious rival to alibaba group holding ltd  whose alipay dominated online payments in china before wechat payment alipay had a total payment volume of  billion in  the last year alibaba or alipay published such figures as for alipays mobile payments most similar to wechat payment these were  billion yuan  billion in  although alipay has since grown as smartphone use has spread in china a spokeswoman for ant financial services group the holding company for alipay declined to comment tencents revenue for the three months through december grew  percent from a year earlier to  billion yuan topping the  billion average forecast of  analysts polled by reuters the groups online advertising revenue more than doubled in the period to  billion yuan while net income
