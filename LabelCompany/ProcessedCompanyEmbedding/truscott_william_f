– ted truscott posted on march   by ellen kinlin william f ‘ted’ truscott ceo columbia threadneedle investments as the ceo of columbia threadneedle investments the asset management subsidiary of ameriprise financial ted truscott is on the move constantly and he’s fine with that  truscott is responsible for overseeing the company’s retail institutional and owned asset portfolios including the columbia and threadneedle families of mutual funds collective funds separate accounts alternative investments and etfs  he is also a member of the ameriprise executive leadership team columbia threadneedle’s assets under management total approximately  billion and its workforce numbers some  people worldwide including approximately  in boston over  in london and nearly  in minneapolis other employees operate from a variety of offices in key markets around the world it’s not surprising therefore that truscott frequently finds himself traveling to europe the middle east and asia all of which he finds invigorating in the fall i sat down for a conversation with truscott in which he talked about the changing face of asset management and the need for new skillsets a sea change in asset management given truscott’s depth of experience in asset management i was eager to get his read on the sector so i immediately cut to the chase what are the trends and developments that you’re seeing and what are the pressure points that keep you up at night i queried  “i think that more than any time in the last  years we’re witnessing a sea change in asset management and it starts with the pricing pressure that’s out there  you’re seeing it in both the retail and institutional marketplaces “so where is it coming from’ well number one part of it’s the environment we’ve had near zero percent interest rates and very low returns so people are looking at fees which makes sense then you’ve got the pressure from passive products the third piece is the evolving regulatory environment here in the us and in europe “in conjunction with that asset management is being unbundled just like the cable industry and what i mean by that is people will pay a certain price for beta smart beta factorbased beta – which used to be called alpha – and then for alpha assuming you can achieve it ie true excess return investors are increasingly making it clear that they want greater choice and are prepared to pay differently for that flexibility “the risk for clients of course is the notion that cheaper means better passive does serve a purpose in our industry – it always has and it always will but it’s not a ‘be all and end all’ to investors’ needs  add in the changing nature of distribution the growing importance of technology as well as the increased globalization of this business and you have an industry that is evolving in big ways at some point passive could get to a point where the inefficiencies that used to be much more prevalent in this market will reappear because passive by nature is just looking in the rear view mirror there’s nothing wrong with it it just by definition looks backward if you’re an optimist about this industry you say the reason that it’s harder to beat the index these days is because there are so many people spending so many hours every day discerning the fair price for a given security that there’s not much upside left to be found “technology is going to play a much bigger role and we’re looking hard at how it’s changing the industry in fact i think the role of the traditional analyst is evolving as technology becomes an increasingly important tool in their toolkit so technology can do more of the basic data gathering for you and you’re going to spend more time doing analysis “i think about whether a successful manager of the past would be successful today  there were certain dynamics that don’t exist anymore including changes brought on by regulation fd  there were not as many portfolio managers or analysts then so if you had an exceptional investor he was going to get famous because he was so good well there are a lot of exceptional investors in boston today that aren’t well known partly because there are more of them it’s harder now “but look there are other industries that are going be growing faster than asset management it’s still a great business and it’s still going to grow because demographics are going to make it grow but there are changes underway “in fact these types of changes have already hit the investment banks and the commercial banks the cream of the crop in this industry – the top portfolio managers and analysts – you’re always going to pay them well you have to but those who aren’t demonstrating value are not going to get paid the way they once did the industry’s going to change in that respect” a demand for new skillsets truscott’s mention of top performers immediately raised a question in my mind when you’re looking for a topnotch executive today whether it be on the distribution side or on the investment management side has your thinking changed at all in terms of what you’re looking for or how you go about doing it and if so how “these days when we’re looking for topnotch individuals on the distribution side their skillset has to be more oriented towards platform distribution because going forward the us is going to look more like europe in terms of more platformbased distribution wholesaling will be different we firmly believe it will have to be more consultative more solutionoriented and more valueadded than it’s ever been so that skillset is going to have to change “we have also been talking actively about the fact that as we hire people – probably more in the investment area – we need more computer science skills i would argue that asset management is late to the party on that one compared to the investment banks and the commercial banks – there’s just more technology that can be utilized” do you think that there will be a merging of technology companies with asset management firms i asked “it could happen right now when you look at the landscape a lot of the financial services technology is roboadvice or payments and payments is an area that should be disrupted by technology we have one of the most inefficient payment systems on the planet why do our kids use venmo because they can just split a check and send five bucks to a buddy and they don’t want to carry cash “the other side of it is that then you go to roboadvice or algorithmic stuff like big financial engines and there’s this thing about finance that lends itself to bricks and clicks – i don’t think that people trust their money to a black box now maybe our children will but there’s just something about handing someone your money to manage there’s a trust element that suggests to me that human interaction is still an important part of money management which you can argue is the reason that it has taken a while for there to be as much as pricing pressure as there is in the industry now “and the final piece is international – you’ve got to have people who can handle dealing with multiple cultures i’m a firm globalist i believe that every asset manager should be a global asset manager the reality is that if you’re going to be a big player these days you have to play globally you can’t just play in the united states so we need managers that are as comfortable in the united kingdom or japan as they are in the united states or vice versa” an evaluation of policies truscott’s talk of the changing face of asset management and the need for new skillsets to work within that space offered a wonderful segue into my next question you were recently named chair of the investment company institute ici and i’m curious what do you view as the most pressing issues demanding your attention “well to say that the new administration has turned things on their head is probably an understatement i think it’s fair to say that many people thought that secretary clinton was going to win and we were going to see a continuation of president obama’s agenda clearly there will be a number of proposals coming out of congress or the white house that are important to the industry including helping people save for retirement and how the industry responds to them is going to be really important  so i think that the landscape is going to be interesting over the next couple of years and ici’s role is to engage in the policy debate around all things asset management “quite frankly i’m flattered and honored that they asked me to be the chair of the board it’s really interesting work and where else in the world can you sit in a room with fifty of your biggest competitors as ed bernard at t rowe price said ‘the really wonderful thing about the ici is that you get everybody in a room together and there’s a common sense of purpose that’s unified around serving clients well’ everybody in that room wants to serve their clients well so that creates a unity in the room that’s actually very interesting as we all compete outside that room “the group is comprised mostly of ceos or heads of distribution you get a few cios but it’s mostly ceos or very senior people and the people are great they’re smart they’re interesting and there’s a shared purpose which is good for the world it’s good for clients we want to treat clients well we want them to succeed and people really bring that to the table” a commitment to diversity having talked about those aspects of asset management that are experiencing major change i couldn’t resist countering with a question on an issue in the sector that seems to change very slowly namely gender balance what is columbia threadneedle doing to ensure that more women reach their goals i queried “i think it’s an important issue and we need to continue to pay attention to it quite frankly it’s not just gender it is diversity broadly defined “if you look at our mutual fund boards the columbia funds board is  percent women and the columbia atlantic board is close to it  women make up a third of our luxembourg board we recently announced the appointment of michelle scrimgeour as our new ceo of emea she will also join the ameriprise executive leadership team so our commitment to diversity is substantial it’s intentional but we can always do better on gender and diversity in general it’s not just about building a pipeline it’s about being deliberate and it’s also about creating a friendly environment for all “my statement to our people is ‘diversity needs to be intentional—it’s not a matter of luck’ we take this very seriously it’s a big subject here and even bigger in the uk we govern regionally – we have business management committees and risk committees in each region – so that’s the us emea and asia these regional committees meet regularly and then we have a global heads group where we get together and run the place globally “i’ve been doing international for a long time i don’t care where people are from it’s just about good people – that’s all that matters so we’re working on that and we’re working on diversity intentionally we sponsor the posse foundation which i see as a big potential pipeline for diverse candidates we are part of the diversity project an industry initiative in the uk we’re also involved in cristo rey network which was started in minnesota that’s more on the ameriprise side but that’s a pipeline for diversity as well and i think that at the end of the day these programs help you’ve got to have the pipeline of people to come in the door “and by the way we’re always working to attract and retain great people and workplace issues evolve and one of those is working from home and managing worklife balance  many people like to or sometimes need to work from home and in this day and age they can  but we have an office for a reason and that reason is because people getting together is actually beneficial in this business there’s a reason asset management has people sitting together we have an open floor plan in the united kingdom we don’t have offices and i like it if i could start over here at  franklin i’d go to an open floor plan our email volumes are down  percent in the uk just because people aren’t sending emails to each other anymore they’re going over to talk” follow us william truscott   zoominfocom form  ameriprise
