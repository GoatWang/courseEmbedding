back i other noncash items eg impairment of properties and accretion of asset retirement obligations and ii other items that management does not consider to be meaningful in assessing our operating performance eg income from discontinued operations gain loss on sale of assets and other nonoperating expense income  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures that are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap we use this adjusted ebitda in our operational and financial decisionmaking believing that such measure is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations    adjusted ebitda is also used by many of our investors research analysts investment bankers and lenders to assess our operating performance  however nongaap measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures and adjusted ebitda may be prepared differently by us than by other companies using similarly titled nongaap measures the reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda is as follows               three months endedmarch  thousands of dollars                 net income loss                      income taxes          interest expense net of interest income           depreciation and amortization           ebitda                       accretion of asset retirement obligations           gain loss on sale of assets          other nonoperating income expense         adjusted ebitda                       the company also considers free cash flow in the operation of its business  free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period  free cash flow is also considered a nongaap financial measure  management believes however that free cash flow which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations is an important financial measure for us in evaluating the companys performance  free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than as a substitute for consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity numerous methods may exist to calculate a companys free cash flow  as a result the method used by our management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their free cash flow  the following table provides a reconciliation of free cash flow a nongaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activities which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow           three months endedmarch  thousands
