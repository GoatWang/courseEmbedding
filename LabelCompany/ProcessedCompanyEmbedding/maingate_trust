does not flow to the fund shareholder via their  investment strategies distribution stability and growth profile chickasaw capital management seeks mlps that continue their record of achieving earnings growth through operational expansion rate increases and acquisitions recent years have seen many major oil companies divest midstream energy assets providing an opportunity for mlps to acquire these assets at attractive valuations — a practice that may in all likelihood continue since mlps tend to distribute the bulk of their available cash to unit holders chickasaw capital management believes that distributions should continue to increase as mlps increase their earnings strategic value of energy infrastructure assets mlps in certain industries that operate strategically important assets — such as the pipelines that deliver crude oil refined products and natural gas — have a history of generating stable and predictable cash flows chickasaw capital management believes that the feebased models of mlps such as these — which are unrelated to commodity prices — combined with the longterm importance of their midstream energy assets may position these mlps to generate stable cash flows throughout economic cycles due to the inelastic nature of demand mlp product pipelines tend to be regulated by federal and state authorities to ensure that rates are fair which may include inflationary rate increases that provide an environment for highly predictable cash flows position within the mlp sector chickasaw capital management typically seeks wellestablished mlps with more significant asset bases and operations as these may enjoy a competitive advantage over other entities seeking to enter the market due to the many challenges involved in creating new rightsofway the lower cost of expanding rather than constructing new assets not to mention the complexities involved in regulating such assets the barriers that must be overcome to gain entry to the midstream energy sector are relatively high this being said chickasaw capital management would remain mindful of smaller lessseasoned mlps should our research and evaluation processes present a clear and present opportunity to achieve the overall investment objective of the fund inefficient market conditions because of a lack of broad institutional ownership and indepth research the market for mlps is often inefficient an opportunity which the fund will seek to exploit historically there has been a lack of mlp ownership for many institutional investors because mlps often generate unrelated business taxable income taxexempt investors such as pension plans endowments employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts have not traditionally been mlp investors because of the perceived taxreporting burdens and complexities associated with mlp investments mlps have historically appealed only to certain retail investors chickasaw capital management believes that due to this limited focus the market for mlps can experience inefficiencies which we will seek to exploit  any tax or legal information provided is merely a summary of our understanding and interpretation of some of the

capital management investment team starts with an energy point of view which influences our outlook on the relative attraction of various sectors of the mlp market the current mlp investment universe is thoroughly analyzed in order to evaluate potential investment candidates through our rigorous research efforts chickasaw capital management develops a clear profile of the risk and return characteristics of a given mlp we seek to identify those factors that most strongly influence the mlp’s distributable cash flow which is more important to us than earnings estimates we then call upon those factors and our understanding of the particular mlps management strategy and project portfolio to forecast future distributable cash flow estimates and anticipated growth rates business prospects then valuation are thoroughly assessed before our process ultimately yields viable candidates for closer consideration while many in the investment community may use statistical measures — such as standard deviation — as proxies for risk we define risk as the potential for any investment loss ultimately we are interested in identifying possible influences and circumstances that could lead to loss we seek to control risk by developing a diversified portfolio comprised of mlps that collectively maintain a history of stable and growing cash flow with exposure that is spread across geographic business capital structure and company management factors chickasaw capital managements research and investment processes have evolved from our depth of experience and expertise these qualities combine with our close longstanding relationships with mlp management teams to help differentiate chickasaw capital management as we strive to deliver competitive returns to our clients  a

was formed from a conversation between two friends chick and the founder of the national hot rod association nhra wally parks the first merchandise line produced by our company was for the nhra us nationals event located in indianapolis in   tshirts were produced with novelty items to compliment the assortment all merchandise was sold out half way through the event weekend  the company continued to grow with the nhra and a few other business partners including the indianapolis motor speedway it became apparent that we needed to be more centrally located to continue with the fulfillment of all our events in  sport service relocated to indianapolis indiana  in late  we changed our name from sport service to maingate inc we started to change our leadership with the hiring
