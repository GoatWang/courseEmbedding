estate planning are just a few ways we make it easier for you to enjoy life we’ve answered a few of the more common questions here if something isn’t covered please contact us and we’ll get it answered   do i need a trust to use your investment services no many of our clients choose trust arrangements because of the unique advantages they offer but you are not required to create a trust if you prefer we can work together on an investment management basis only we’ll create a simple letter of instructions stating that you are designating capital city trust company to act as your investment agent what are the advantages of a trust  with a trust you can not only draw on our broad investment capabilities but also arrange to have us perform any number of other personalized services these services could range from making payments of estimated taxes while youre traveling abroad to providing full personal financial management if you are unable to do it yourself due to serious illness or other life event also you can name one or more beneficiaries to receive the assets of your trust at your death which provides tremendous advantages including avoiding probate or you can have your trust continue beyond your lifetime serving as a source of continuing income and support for your spouse a child or others you designate is it difficult to set up a trust not at all – it can be done in just two steps first you transfer the securities andor deposits to capital city trust company for management and oversight then you give us your written instructions in the form of a trust agreement the agreement – drawn up by an attorney – is signed by you as creator of the trust and by capital city trust company as trustee these are often called “living trusts” to distinguish them from testamentary trusts those established under the terms of a will living trusts created for the purpose of personal asset management are also known as “revocable trusts” because the person who creates the trust reserves the right to cancel or revoke it if i create a trust can i keep control yes you are assured of this in three ways according to what the trust agreement specifies that you can make withdrawals or additions at any time that you reserve the right to cancel the trust that you reserve the right to give us new or different instructions by amending the trust agreement can i make the investment decisions some of our clients like to take active participation such as selecting particular stocks or bonds however most of our clients value our unbiased approach to portfolio management because they lack the time or specialized knowledge that it requires still you can delegate as much or as little investment responsibility as you want it’s your trust there are also hybrid approaches you might spell out your goals and requirements in some detail then leave the selection of specific investments to us as trustee you could ask us to submit each proposed investment change for your approval until youre satisfied that were interpreting your wishes accurately you might ask us to submit recommendations while also researching some opportunities on your own with a trust you make the rules are trusts expensive no our fees are competitive with those charged by investment advisory firms although theirs may not include custodianship of securities recordkeeping and other conveniences that we offer or mutual funds   how big must a trust fund be if you think “millions of dollars” when you hear the word “trust” youre the victim of a common misconception todays trust institutions have developed ways to handle even relatively small trusts efficiently in any case we dont think in terms of fixed minimums instead we ask ourselves is a trust the best way to meet this clients financial management needs to find out whether a trust would be right for you please contact us and we’ll explore your options how much of a return will i get on my money that depends on your goals—current income longterm growth to offset inflation or some balance of the two—and on everchanging investment conditions over roughly the past  years diversified portfolios of goodquality stocks have produced an average total annual return dividends plus growth in principal value around  bonds have produced somewhat lower returns overall but they sometimes offer a higher level of current income than stocks although past performance is no guarantee of future results our goal as trustee is to provide reasonably consistent returns over the years we emphasize careful asset allocation the selection of quality investments and constant vigilance who should be the trustee of my trust experience is the most important criteria you should look for a person or financial organization such as capital city trust company with experience in a variety of market changes and handling diverse family needs you want the type of experience that will provide the greatest financial security for you and your family your trustee should have financial strength as well as professional investment capabilities the trustee should participate in the financial markets every day ideally with trusteeship being considered a fulltime job how can i find out more about trusts thats easy our trust and investment professionals can provide a more personal introduction to trusts after hearing more about your
