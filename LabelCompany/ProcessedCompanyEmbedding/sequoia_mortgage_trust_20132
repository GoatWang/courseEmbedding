aggregate pool included loans originated from primelending  and wj bradley mortgage capital  the remainder of the mortgage loans was originated by various mortgage lending institutions each of which

owneroccupied properties comprise  of the loans the states that represent the largest geographic concentration are california  texas  and virginia  key rating drivers highquality mortgage pool the collateral pool consists of year fully amortizing fully documented frms to borrowers with strong credit profiles low leverage and substantial liquid reserves thirdparty loanlevel due diligence was conducted on  of the pool and fitch believes the results of the review generally indicate strong underwriting controls originators with limited performance history the majority of the pool was originated by lenders with limited nonagency performance history the lack of performance history is partially mitigated by the  thirdparty diligence conducted on these loans that resulted in immaterial findings fitch also considers the credit enhancement ce on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the originator risk geographically diverse pool the collateral pool is geographically diverse the percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas msas is  and concentration in california is  similar to recent semt transactions the agency did not apply a default penalty to the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk transaction provisions enhance deal framework the representation warranty and enforcement mechanism framework is viewed positively as it is consistent with fitch criteria as in other recent fitchrated semt transactions semt  contains binding arbitration provisions that may serve to provide timely resolution to representation and warranty disputes in addition all loans that become  days or more delinquent will be reviewed for breaches of representations and warranties rating sensitivities fitchs analysis incorporates sensitivity analyses to demonstrate how the ratings would react to steeper market value declines mvds than assumed at both the metropolitan statistical area msa and national levels the implied rating sensitivities are only an indication of some of the potential outcomes and do not consider other risk factors that the transaction may become exposed to or be considered in the surveillance of the transaction fitch conducted sensitivity analysis on areas where the model projected lower home price declines than that of the overall collateral pool the model currently projects sustainable mvds smvds at the msa level for one of the top  regions fitchs sustainable home price shp model does not project declines in home prices this region is dallasplanoirving in texas  fitch conducted sensitivity analysis assuming smvds of   and  compared with those projected by fitchs shp model for this region the sensitivity analysis indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario in its analysis fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent economic performance in determining market value declines while fitchs current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one year of projections this does not incorporate recent notable economic improvement to reflect the more recent economic environment a sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical economic data and two years of projections the result of this sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss expectations for this transaction this sensitivity analysis resulted in a base smvd of  slightly less than the  base smvd projected in the current model another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings would react to steeper mvds at the national level the analysis assumes mvds of   and  in addition to the modelprojected  for this pool the analysis indicates there is some potential rating migration with higher mvds compared with the model projection additional detail on the transaction is described in the new issue report sequoia mortgage trust  additional information is available at wwwfitchratingscom in addition to the
