that day and it was over  at globeflex we stay alert to unintended bets to minimize risk and are adaptable to enhancing our portfolio construction we increased the efficacy of our stock selection through creating sectorspecific models and also tightened portfolio construction the modifications on the alpha side werent just to pull in better shortterm performance although during the recent speculative market environment better shortterm performance would have been welcome rather we were upgrading our skill level for the long term well always be fundamental stockpickers well always be systematic in our approach and well always be a focused active researchoriented manager but we also will always be flexible because markets are never going to be so stable that you can figure it out once and for all your process has to be constantly evolutionary marina marrelli director × marina marrelli is partner and chief executive officer of globeflex capital lp parent of globeflex research india pvt ltd we are a tightknit team of experts and we want to keep it that way a focused institutional boutique can be proactive in protecting its environment and since every incoming personality changes the organism we carefully choose we get a lot of resumes from incredibly bright talented driven people but we need individuals who really want to be part of a team and understand what that means in terms of mutual learning and mutual respect and mutual teaching our culture calls for lots of multitasking and the roles are more blurred than in a large firm its not for everyone in addition to hiring the right people its giving people enough freedom in their positions to own their jobs which brings with it complete accountability you have authority you have responsibility and you have accountability weve built a web of interaccountability its not just oneonone its accountability to the team to the specific project group youre working with people here are given unlimited upside potential the greatest gratification comes from feeling that all your efforts and talents directly affect the bottom line that you are positively regarded and that you are respected for your skill set theres no ceiling we add the right people when necessary but to keep the human component as focused as possible we are also very focused on technology consultants and others are always surprised that a privately owned firm of our size has built the sorts of resources weve built not only do we have a research platform that serves as a portfolio management laboratory testing any investment concept we can conceive of we also have a straightthrough processing that brings enormous efficiency here the client is boss in every form of the word we are oriented toward collaboration internally and externally so we tend to attract clients who are more analytic and who view their managers more as a resource their requests for information are a source of learning it would be easier to be less responsive to have more mass appeal but that doesnt fit our personality if you want to keep being mentally challenged if you want to keep pushing the research envelope this is the best way to do it
