receive any proceeds from the resale of the securities offered through this prospectus by the selling security holders the selling security holders will receive all proceeds from this offering and if all of the shares being offered by this prospectus are sold at  per share those proceeds would be approximately  our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies academic institutions government agencies and research institutions key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy safety and tolerability profile reliability convenience of dosing price and reimbursement the market for antimalarial drugs business is especially large and competitive the products we are going to acquire will face intense competition many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors accordingly our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining fda approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance our competitors drugs may be more effective or more effectively marketed and sold than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates our competitors may also obtain fda or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours we anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available finally the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs noncompetitive or obsolete company description we are a development stage company and we plan to be in the business of marketing distributing and selling pharmaceutical medicines in international tenders managed by world health organizationgeneva who until recently we did not yet own the rights to market distribute or sell any pharmaceutical medicines on july   however we entered into a license agreement the “agreement” which was amended on july   and again on october   with luckycom pharma pte ltd based out of singapore and acquired the exclusive and worldwide rights to manufacture have manufactured distribute sell market and promote the antimalarial medicine cosunate artesunateamodiaquine kit tablets luckycom pharma is owned by our officer and director kingrich lee and as such the agreement is considered a related party transaction the shares paid under the agreement belong to mr kingrich through his company luckycom pharma moreover the value set at  per share was arbitrarily chosen was not the result of an arm’s length valuation process and does not reflect our book value or any other objective criteria of value in the next twelve months and beyond we plan to qualify and gain acceptance in international public tenders through the prequalification program process with the who an international public tender also called government procurement or public procurement is the procurement of goods and services on behalf of a public authority such as a government agency later on in this prospectus we have detailed the preliminary steps we need to take and those involved in the actual application process with the who we have no assurance that we will meet the requirements necessary to be accepted under the prequalification program we expect to be preparing for and in the application process for at least two to three years and maybe longer if we are able to gain acceptance and prequalify with the who our long term plan is to seek out public opportunities in this venue and participate in bulk supplying of medicines our license with luckcom pharma is only for two years if the application process with the who exceeds two years and assuming we have financing available to make it that far in the process we will have to renegotiate our two year license agreement with luckycom pharma or exercise our option to purchase the cosunate intellectual property from luckycom pharma outright as of february   we had  in current assets consisting of cash and current liabilities in the amount of  accordingly we had a working capital deficit of  as of february   we have  in cash as of june    even so our current working capital is not sufficient to enable us to implement our business plan as set forth in this prospectus for these and other reasons our independent auditors have raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as we have not yet begun operations we anticipate that we will meet our ongoing cash requirements through equity or debt financing we estimate that our expenses over the next  months will be approximately  this estimate may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources in the next twelve months and beyond we plan to qualify and

ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources we intend to meet our cash requirements for the next  months through a combination of debt financing and equity financing by way of private

arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable to us if we are not able to raise the full  to implement our business plan as anticipated we will scale our business development in line with available capital our primary priority will be to retain our reporting

with the first quarter of fiscal year ending march   we are reporting the third quarter of fiscal year ending march   as a ninemonth period ended december   the change to the company’s fiscal year

financial position or cash flow note  – going concern     the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future  the company has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december   and further losses are anticipated as a result of the development of business which raises substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern  the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining financing necessary to meet the company’s obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal

anticipate that we will meet our ongoing cash requirements through equity or debt financing over the next few years we intend to qualify and gain acceptance in international public tenders for antimalarial drugs through the prequalification programme governed by the world health organization “who” the “prequalification programme” we initially believed that our expenses over the next  months will be approximately  this estimate may change significantly depending on the nature of our future business activities and our ability to raise capital from shareholders or other sources   we intend to meet our cash requirements for the next  months through a combination of debt and equity financing by way of private placements as a reporting company we are better equipped to raise capital because of the transparency of our operations and development we currently do not have any arrangements in place to complete any private placement financings and there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any such financings on terms that will be acceptable to us   if we are not able to raise  to implement our business plan as anticipated we will need to scale our business development in line with available capital our primary priority will be to retain our reporting status with the sec which means that we will first ensure that we have sufficient capital to cover our legal and accounting expenses which are estimated to be  over the next  months once these costs are accounted for we will focus on the following activities       establish a management team to work on our pharmaceutical operations  by december  and          execute a manufacturing agreement with a manufacturer with facilities which are compliant with medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency “mhra” guidelines and work on the prequalification programme application  by december           identify and locate a privatelyowned company or companies involved in the pharmaceutical business which is looking to become a publicly listed company by combining their operation with us through a reverse merge   any failure to raise money will have the effect of delaying the timeframes in our business plan as set forth below and we may have to push back the dates of such activities    table of contents secure necessary funds  we plan to obtain financing from friends family and business associates this activity will be ongoing until adequate capital has been secured on terms favorable to us andor sufficient revenue is generated to meet our ongoing capital requirements we require    of funding in the next  months we have  in cash as of december   and plan to obtain the remaining funds from a combination of debt andor equity financing arrangements we anticipate that mr kingrich lee our ceo will spearhead our financing efforts   mhra uk manufacturer  we currently do not have a manufacturing facility we plan to rely upon a contract manufacturer to produce both drug substances and drug products we have identified a manufacturing plant with mhra compliant facilities in india and the manufacturing plant is not affiliated with mr lee our company or the companies that mr lee owns in the next  months if we are able to obtain funding we plan to work with the mhra compliant facility in india to start the process of establishing a relationship and retrofitting their facilities to meet who standards we hope to establish this relationship and begin the retrofitting process by december  we anticipate it will cost  to negotiate with the manufacturer and establish a plan to retrofit its facilities the build out to meet who standards will entail funds beyond the initial  estimate we do not believe we will get to the retrofitting stage in the next  months we will have to raise more than the  we plan to raise in the next  months to achieve the retrofitting step we will know more about the costs of retrofitting once we have retained a consultant we anticipate that mr lee and a consultant who we anticipate hiring in the future will spearhead our efforts to meet our manufacturing needs   prepare and apply for the prequalification programme with the who  it takes anywhere from three  months to three  years to gain access to the who program for international tenders we believe that it will cost approximately  to qualify for the prequalification programme this relates to the cost of i inspection of contract research organizations “cros” and good clinical practice “gcp” and good laboratory practice “glp” inspection of cros ii manufacturing of drug samples preparation of drug dossiers and bioequivalent studies and iii traveling expenses associated with establishing contacts with international distributors we intend to commence our preparation for the prequalification programme by december  as stated earlier we will first need to retain a consultant to guide us through this process and all costs stated above are estimates provided by management and subject to change   there are no first time application fee for prequalification programme  the prequalification process takes a minimum of three  months if the product meets all the required standards when products do not meet the appropriate standards the process can take longer and if the applicant fails to prove the quality safety and efficacy of its medicine it will not be prequalified even though some larger firms are able to complete the process in a matter of months we believe that it will take us two  to three  years to complete the prequalification process because we need to enroll mhra compliant facilities retrofit such facilities in accordance with who standards engage active pharmaceuticals ingredients “api” suppliers with who prequalification and gather all the data testing and sampling needed to apply for prequalification other more established firms already have these requirements in place and therefore it takes them less time to maneuver through the prequalification programme   compensate management    on october   our whollyowned subsidiary luckycom ltd entered into an employment agreement with mr kingrich lee pursuant to which he will receive  per year the employment agreement terminates on september   unless renewed marketing and distribution channels  we do not currently have an infrastructure for the sales marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products we must develop our sales marketing and distribution channels or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services after the prequalification process we will engage in discussions with third parties to assist us in the distribution and sale of our products we intend to engage a european international tender distributor to carry out our distribution efforts which can reduce the sales and marketing expenses we would otherwise incur we anticipate that mr lee will spearhead our efforts to establish connections with distributors for our products we do not currently know what the cost will be for these services   if we are not able to raise  we will have to scale back our operations our primary priority will be to retain our reporting status with the sec which means paying our accounting and legal professionals we also will prioritize paying the salary of our ceo mr lee to spearhead efforts to implement our business plan as detailed above    table

of operations   on october   our wholly owned subsidiary luckycom ltd entered into an employment agreement with mr lee the agreement is for one year and provides annual compensation of  and other benefits this agreement will materially impact our cash needs in the future as any investment money we obtain will be used to pay mr lee’s salary and other benefits and will have the effect of diverting funds that may be used to pursue our business plan on august   we entered into subscription agreements with an aggregate of two  investors for the purchase and sale of an aggregate of

shares valued at  per share upon the closing of the offering despite having  in cash as of december   we have insufficient cash to operate our business at the current level for the next  months and insufficient cash to achieve our business goals the success of our business plan beyond the next  months is contingent upon us obtaining additional financing we intend to fund operations through debt andor equity financing arrangements which may be insufficient to fund our capital expenditures working capital or other cash requirements we do not have any formal commitments or arrangements for the sale of stock or the advancement of loans of funds at this time there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all   offbalance sheet arrangements     we have no offbalance sheet arrangements   critical accounting policies     our financial statements are affected by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation we have identified below the accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management   fair value of financial instruments   the company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents accrued expenses and loans payable to an officer the carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements income taxes     income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method  under the asset and liability method deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws  a valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that based on available evidence are not expected to be realized use of estimates     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period we regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results future results of operations will be affected  table of contents revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when products are fully delivered or services have been provided and collection is reasonably assured stockbased compensation   stockbased compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with asc topic   to date the company has not adopted a stock option plan and has not granted any stock options basic income loss per share   basic income loss per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net loss applicable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares during the period diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the company’s net income available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted for any potentially dilutive debt or equity there are no such common stock equivalents outstanding as of december     comprehensive income   the company has which established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income its components and accumulated balances  when applicable the company would disclose this information on its statement of stockholders’ equity  comprehensive income comprises

hong kong dollar and is translated to us dollars using the exchange rate effective for the date reported for assets and liabilities and the average exchange rate for the period reported for revenues and expenses recent accounting pronouncements   we have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our financial statements and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   going concern   we have a working capital of  have incurred losses since inception of  and have not yet received revenues from sales of products or services these factors create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern   our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating cash from the sale of our common stock andor obtaining debt financing and attaining future profitable operations management’s plans include selling our equity securities and obtaining debt financing to fund our capital requirement and ongoing operations provided however there can be no assurance we will be successful in these efforts  table of contents   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  not required for smaller reporting companies   item  controls and procedures  disclosure controls and procedures   we conducted an evaluation with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and rule de under the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” as of december   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the exchange act is i recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms and ii accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive and chief financial officer or persons performing similar functions as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has concluded that as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified below our principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions   remediation plan to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis management identified the following two material weaknesses that have caused management to conclude that as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective at the reasonable assurance level • we do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions which is a basic internal control we only have one officer and director due to our size and nature segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible however to the extent possible the initiation of transactions the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness   • effective controls over the control environment have not been maintained specifically we do not have a formally adopted written code of business conduct and ethics that governs our employees officers and directors additionally management has not developed and effectively communicated to its employees its accounting policies and procedures this has resulted in inconsistent practices further our board of directors does not currently have any independent members and no director qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in item dii of regulation sk since these entity level programs have a pervasive effect across the organization management has determined that these circumstances constitute a material weakness to address these material weaknesses management performed additional analyses and other procedures to ensure that the financial statements included herein fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented accordingly we believe that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented    table of contents to remediate the material weakness in our documentation evaluation and testing of internal controls we plan to engage a thirdparty firm to assist us in remedying this material weakness once resources become available   we intend to remedy our material weakness with regard to insufficient segregation of duties by hiring additional employees in order to segregate duties in a manner that establishes effective internal controls once resources become available   changes in internal control over financial reporting   during the fiscal quarter ended december   there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
