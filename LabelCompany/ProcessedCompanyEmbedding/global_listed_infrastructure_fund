brookfield global listed infrastructure income fund brookfield real assets income fund brookfield new horizons income fund brookfield global infrastructure securities income fund brookfield select opportunities income fund brookfield global listed infrastructure income fund overview objective and strategy the funds investment objective is to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on income the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in securities of publicly traded infrastructure companies why invest in brookfield global listed infrastructure income fund inc access to a rapidly growing asset class with compelling supplydemand characteristics the growing need for infrastructure spending and the significant cost of funding such projects has led to significant growth in global listed infrastructure as an asset class historically supply and demand characteristics have been compelling driven by the combination of supply that has been constrained by high barriers to entry and relatively stable demand from essential services the attractive investment potential of global listed infrastructure the fund invests in publicly traded infrastructure companies believed by brookfield to have stable longlived assets that are essential to the global economy historically attractive longterm total returns for the asset class have been tied to cash flows derived from longterm contracts concessions and regulated revenues which tend to be stable and correlated with inflation as such the fund has the potential for the payment of attractive dividends that may grow over time the manager also believes that a portfolio composed of well diversified global infrastructure securities has the potential for capital appreciation and strong riskadjusted investment returns access to a global investment platform and a management team with longstanding infrastructure expertise the fund provides an opportunity to access a portfolio management team with deep operational and direct investment experience as well as track record investing in global listed infrastructure securities the team also draws upon internal expertise and

assets less all liabilities by the total number of common shares outstanding the common share market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the fund at a given time weighted average market capitalization is a stock market index weighted by the market capitalization of each stock in the index in such a weighting scheme larger companies account for a greater portion of the index most indexes are constructed in this manner with the best example being the sp  weighted median market capitalization is the point at which half of the market value of a portfolio is invested in stocks with a greater market cap and consequently the other half is invested in stocks with a lower market cap turnover is sourced from the funds current prospectus riskreturn definitions alpha is the excess return or value added positive or negative of the portfolio’s return relative to the return of the benchmark beta is a measure of the relative volatility of a security or portfolio to the markets upward or downward movements a beta greater than  identifies an issue or fund that will move more than the market while a beta less than  identifies an issue or fund that will move less than the market the beta of the market is always equal to  information ratio is the portfolio’s alpha or excess return per unit of risk as measured by tracking error versus the portfolio’s benchmark r squared measures how well an investment’s returns correlate to an index an r squared of  means the portfolio performance is  correlated to the index’s whereas a low rsquared means that the portfolio performance is less correlated to the index’s sharpe ratio is a riskadjusted measure calculated as the ratio of excess return to standard deviation the sharpe ratio determines reward per unit of risk the higher the sharpe ratio the better the historical riskadjusted performance standard deviation measures how widely individual performance returns within a performance series are dispersed from the average or mean value tracking error is the amount by which the performance of the portfolio differs from that of the benchmark upsidedownside market capture measures performance in up down markets relative to the market benchmark risk considerations there is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective portfolios are subject to market risk which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them accordingly you can lose money investing in this portfolio please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks in general equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency political economic market and liquidity risks the risks of investing in emerging market countries are greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed countries companies within the infrastructure industry are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their business or operations including high interest leverage and regulatory costs difficulty raising capital the effect of an economic slowdown or recession and surplus capacity and increased competition other risks include technological innovation significant changes in the number of endusers an increasing deregulatory environment natural and environmental risks and terrorist attacks stocks of small and medium capitalization companies entail special risks such as limited product lines markets and financial resources and greater market volatility than securities of larger more established companies nondiversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers so changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility in the portfolio illiquid securities
