expected to be in a range of  million about  below the zacks expectation  earnings eps will now be in a range between  and  well below the expected  level  management blamed delayed deals in north

revenues are derived from the service provider segment  further these segment deals typically suffer from unpredictable timing and tend to be lumpy throughout the year  management’s commentsaccording to lee chen president and ceo “we are disappointed with our preliminary results revenue came in below our guidance as a number of opportunities in our pipeline did not close primarily in north america and to a lesser degree in japan key deals remain in our pipeline and we are diligently working to improve our execution we remain confident that our investments in security and cloud will serve as a
