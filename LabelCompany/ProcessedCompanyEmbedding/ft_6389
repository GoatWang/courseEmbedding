close marketsmarkets datacompany announcements financial timesclosesearch theftsearch company announcements avita medical ltdavita medical ceo issues shareholder lettertwitterfacebooklinkedingoogleplusredditpinteresturljul    bstsource business wire valencia calif  perth australia  londonbusiness wirejul   today the ceo of avita medical limited asxavh otcqxavmxy issued the following letter to shareholders dear shareholder it is with great pleasure that i write to you as the new ceo of avita medical as we move into an exciting new era of commercialization and clinical trials avita’s proprietary technology that generates our “sprayon skin” or res regenerative epithelial suspension delivers to the patient an innovative regenerative medicine solution applicable to a broad array of challenging skin conditions these include but are not limited to acute andor chronic skin injuries such as burns and chronic wounds as well as various skin defects such as depigmentation for example in patients with vitiligo our technology platform is one that i contend to be unique in the marketplace with a plethora of opportunities i have been involved with avita as a nonexecutive director since early  and bring with me extensive experience and expertise across the value chain in cellular therapies additionally i bring to the company notable experience in product development regulatory affairs business development and general management — all of which i trust will be of material value to avita’s future success my motivation to undertake the ceo role for the company was in part inspired because  and  are transformational years for avita that include multiple valuecreating milestones including a us pma premarket approval application submission initial barda procurement potential for an advisory panel as part of the fda review process and an opportunity to focus on augmenting our supply chain while eagerly preparing for our us launch in  many of you may be asking yourselves what is different today as compared to prior years for avita medical well let me begin by stating some important facts that will shape and indeed transform avita’s future trajectory firstly the us represents the largest healthcare market in the world and this accounts for our increasing us focus secondly in  a fiveyear contract was signed with the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda allocating us million to avita of key importance is the fact that barda is supporting not only our pma process but is also substantially motivated to ensure that avita is marketready by supporting ongoing exposure and training of clinicians and surgeons to our product via compassionate use and continued access thirdly barda intends to purchase prior to us fda approval us million of recell® devices to be stockpiled with an option to buy up to an additional us million in support of surge capacity moreover barda has also allotted us million in support of a burns trial in pediatric patients in a nutshell barda funds are being purposefully directed to broadly strengthen avita’s operations to derisk our fda review and approval process and to build awareness of recell® in the burns community ahead of our us launch so to answer the question directly this is remarkably different from our prior approach because the us launch of our technology platform will this time be based upon well controlled clinical trials inextricably intertwined with robust healtheconomic and costeffectiveness data these data will demonstrate to regulators and physicians alike that recell® works precisely as we claim it does and will justify why it should be embraced as the new standard of care as you are aware from our midmay announcement we have completed our us pivotal trial which demonstrated positive results in our us burns study as i mentioned above in the nearterm avita intends to submit a pma to the us fda seeking approval of recell® for use in patients with severe burns we also plan to review whether the us should become avita’s main operational hub while still maintaining key strategic rd efforts in australia and other influential geographies to this end avita will be conducting a strategic review to assess the longterm positioning of the company and its operations as it increasingly looks to the us markets for growth of product sales within this framework we also intend to review the best location for avita’s administration and head office and to concurrently evaluate future capital requirements as we grow the company this strategic review may include a proposal for moving our administration and head office functions to the us in context of a redomicile of the group i look forward to keeping you updated as we progress in achieving our goals and objectives sincerely mike dr michael s perrychief executive officeravita medical ltd about avita medical limited avita’s patented and proprietary
