dividends t july th dividend aristocrats  print article dividend kings stocks with  consecutive years of dividend growth are a rare and prized collection of generally low risk income growth investments   many of these companies have established leadership positions in the markets they serve through some combination of economies of scale intellectual property and customer relationships   in the case of tootsie roll tr the company has increased its dividend for  consecutive years thanks largely to its portfolio of popular candy brands   given warren buffett’s affection for popular food brands in his dividend portfolio here let’s take a closer look at tootsie roll to see if this dividend king could be an appealing longterm investment   business overview founded in  by leo hirschfield in chicago illinois tootsie roll is the maker of famous candy brands as tootsie roll tootsie pops child’s play caramel apple pops charms blowpop junior mints charleston chew sugar daddy sugar babies andes razzles and dubble bubble   source tootsie roll annual report   it sells its products primarily through  candy and grocery brokers to over  supermarkets variety stores dollar stores chain grocers and drug chains in the us as well as numerous outlets in canada and mexico which are its largest foreign markets   the company also sells in europe the middle east and asia but the us is its largest market accounting for roughly  of total product revenue   business analysis tootsie roll’s large portfolio of wellknown brands generally means that its sales are steady in all types of economic environments which is important for a company that has become famous for clockworklike annual dividend increases   that being said like most food companies tootsie roll isn’t a fastgrowing company in fact sales peaked in  and have been gradually declining ever since   source simply safe dividends   fortunately management has proven effective at maximizing the company’s economies of scale and cutting costs in recent years   in fact thanks to its specialized highspeed equipment and highly automated manufacturing facilities the company has been able to generate steady improvements in margins and returns on shareholder capital   this is courtesy of the company launching its “enterprise resource planning” system or erp in  this corporate turnaround plan was based on using advanced analytics to help managers streamline and maximize the flexibility of the company’s manufacturing systems and supply chain     in fact today tootsie roll enjoys some of the industry’s highest profitability   sources morningstar and gurufocus   going forward the company has four opportunities to stabilize and return to moderate sales growth  the first is launching new product lines such as cella dips chocolate covered whole dried cherries and caramel marshmallow sugar babies   the second is increased distributions of existing products especially in emerging markets such as india and china where a fastgrowing middle class could fuel a large increase in per capita candy consumption   third the company is revamping its advertising budget away from more traditional routes such as tv and print and towards a greater focus on social media such as twitter facebook and instagram   this shift is intended to increase its brand awareness and popularity with millennials and america’s youth market   and finally the company can continue to grow through acquisitions as it has over the past  years when it purchased such wellknown brands as andes dubble bubble junior mints and dots   key risks while tootsie roll’s status as a dividend king is worthy of respect there are nonetheless several major risks to owning this stock   the most obvious is that while the company’s ability to boost its margins over time with increasing use of automation and cost cutting is impressive there are limits to how how high margins can go especially given that its key ingredients such as sugar and coco are highly cyclical commodities   which means that at some point tootsie roll’s dividend growth prospects will slow unless it can turnaround its declining sales   unfortunately the us its largest and most important market is largely saturated meaning that organic sales growth potential is pretty much limited to matching  to  population growth   however that may not prove the case if shifting consumer sentiment specifically away from high sugar snacks results in weaker future candy sales   and while foreign markets can serve as a good potential source of growth remember that the global candy industry is massively competitive dominated by giants such as hershey’s hsy mondelez international mdlz and nestle nsrgy   these wellcapitalized rivals are potentially able to better compete in fastergrowing emerging markets with advertising budgets orders of magnitude larger than tootsie roll’s as well as potentially better knowledge of local tastes   that means that the company’s best bet to achieve stronger top line sales growth is through acquisitions which always come at the risk of overpaying and underperforming on execution ie failing to achieve expected synergies   finally anyone interested in tootsie roll should know that the company although public since  is effectively a private company under the total control of the gordon family including the current chairwoman and ceo yearold ellen gordon   source tootsie roll annual report   ms gordon took over control of the company from melvin gordon in  upon the death of the yearold ceo who had run the company for over  years   normally strong insider ownership is a good thing as is very long management tenure because it aligns the incentives of management with those of shareholders and means that executives have plenty of experience in achieving steady growth   however in this case tootsie roll due to its dual class share system is entirely under the control of the gordon family this is because ms gordon’s father william rubin took over a large controlling interest in sweets company of america tootsie roll’s precursor in the ’s after the death of its founder   source motley fool   which means that today ellen gordon controls  of the voting rights in tootsie roll giving her absolute say in all corporate policies thanks to her almost exclusive ownership of the company’s class b shares which have  times the voting rights of common stock these shares were created in the ’s to ensure the couple’s lock on power   critics of the gordons including shareholders who have periodically sued management over the years claim that the gordon’s have abused this absolute power by paying themselves lavishly in both salary and benefits   for example in  mr and mrs gordon were paid  million in salary made use of the company jet for private reasons flying between their primary home in massachusetts and chicago to the tune of  million and had the company pay for their  per month chicago apartment where they stayed part time when working from the corporate headquarters   all told that meant that the couple’s compensation  was  million  of the company’s total revenue that year   in addition ms gordon isn’t a big fan of transparency and as a result the company doesn’t do conference calls issue guidance of any kind or even have an investor relations page   in other words anyone owning shares of tootsie roll has to accept the fact that they are completely at the mercy of nontransparent management who can do almost anything it wants as well as pay itself whatever it likes top five executives were paid  million in  or  of revenue   tootsie roll dividend safety we analyze  years of dividend data and  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend   our dividend safety score answers the question “is the current dividend payment safe” we look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical eps and fcf payout ratios debt levels free cash flow generation industry cyclicality roic trends and more   dividend safety scores range from  to  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least  since tracking the data companies cutting their dividends had an average dividend safety score below  at the time of their dividend reduction announcements     we wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how dividend safety scores are calculated what their realtime track record has been and how to use them for your portfolio here   tootsie roll has a dividend safety score of  which suggests that the company offers one of the safest and most dependable dividends on wall street   that’s not surprising given its year payout growth history   in fact tootsie roll has paid an uninterrupted quarterly dividend for  years and has also paid an annual  annual stock dividend for the past half century   this kind of steady performance and high dividend security is due to three main factors   the first being that food companies in general have very stable if slow growing sales earnings and cash flows after all even during recessions people need to eat and candy is a low cost indulgence that generally isn’t highly cyclical   next management has been very conservative with the company’s dividend growth maintaining very low eps and free cash flow payout ratios below  most years     with the annual cash dividend consuming only about  of any year’s eps and about  of free cash flow the payout is extremely well insulated against any unexpected negative events such as a sharp spike in commodity prices or currency swings which would ding earnings   finally we can’t forget the importance of a strong balance sheet which offers the company plenty of flexibility to both invest in future growth as well as continue rewarding investors with the steady payout growth for which tootsie roll is famous   as you can see tootsie roll’s enjoys a pristine fortresslike balance sheet with no debt a substantial cash position enough to cover nearly seven years of dividends and one of the strongest current ratios shortterm assetsshortterm liabilities not just in the industry but of any company on wall street     in fact when we compare tootsie roll’s metrics against its industry peers things look even better   sources morningstar fast graphs simply safe dividends   that’s because this is a highly capital intensive industry generally marked by a very high leverage ratio debtebitda and low current ratios   in contrast tootsie roll’s lack of debt and high current ratio mean that if it were ever to issue bonds such as to make a large acquisition it would likely receive a high investmentgrade rating that would allow it plentiful access to very cheap growth capital   tootsie roll’s dividend growth our dividend growth score answers the question “how fast is the dividend likely to grow” it considers many of the same fundamental factors as the safety score but places more weight on growthcentric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios scores of  are average  or higher is very good and  or lower is considered weak   tootsie roll’s dividend growth score of  indicates that it has above average dividend growth potential however that’s largely due to its low payout ratios and not necessarily because of a history of fast dividend growth     going forward tootsie roll should be capable of  to  organic sales growth which it can boost to  to  through acquisitions   combined with ongoing margin expansion from cost cutting and larger of economies of scale as well as steady  to  net share buybacks  annually over the past  years tootsie roll might be able to generate longterm eps growth of  to    and because its payout ratios are so low tootsie roll could provide dividend investors with somewhat faster payout growth should management want to along the lines of  to  over the coming years   of course this is merely the company’s potential earnings and dividend outlook whether or not tootsie roll manages to achieve it depends on stabilizing its declining sales returning to top line growth and rational decisionmaking from the management team if sales continue declining than shareholders should only expect  to  payout growth going forward   valuation over the past year tootsie roll has underperformed the sp  by about  however that doesn’t mean its valuation is attractive in fact the stock’s valuation appears quite rich   for example tr’s forward pe ratio is  more than double the sp ’s  it’s also much higher than its industry peers who have a median forward pe ratio of    and while tootsie roll has never been especially cheap over the past  years its median forward pe ratio was  today’s valuation looks especially stretched   in other words while tootsie roll’s industry leading profitability and impressive dividend growth record mean it probably deserves a market premium today’s share price represents an  premium to its rivals which is probably not warranted given its slow growth potential   meanwhile the current cash yield of  while in line with its historic  yield over the past  years is only about half that of the broader sp  which yields    in addition it’s far below the industry median yield of  in other words tootsie roll’s low payout doesn’t offer investors much especially considering that the company isn’t exactly experiencing fast earnings growth   now in fairness the company’s annual  stock dividend does mean that investors can probably achieve longterm total returns of  to   total yield   to  potential earnings growth with  to  being the more likely conservative estimate   while that may be decent total return potential especially for a dividend king the fact remains that tr’s forward pe ratio carries significant risk especially when combined with some of the company’s questionable management practices   conclusion while there is a lot to like about tootsie roll at the same time the company has major issues it needs to deal with most notably its weakening top line and potential succession issues when ms gordon becomes unable to fulfill her duties   when combined with a very low cash yield unlike some of the best high dividend stocks here modest payout growth prospects that make it a weaker income growth stock and a potentially frightening valuation i simply can’t recommend tootsie roll for any diversified dividend portfolio   that’s especially true when there are far better dividend aristocrat alternatives which offer more yield stronger longterm dividend growth

homedividend aristocratstootsie roll industries tr a dividend king with a safe payout and iconic brands tootsie roll industries tr a dividend king with a safe payout and iconic brands simply safe dividends t july th dividend aristocrats  print article dividend kings stocks with  consecutive years of dividend growth are a rare and prized collection of generally low risk income growth investments   many of these companies have established leadership positions in the markets they serve through some combination of economies of scale intellectual property and customer relationships   in the case of tootsie roll tr the company has increased its dividend for  consecutive years thanks largely to its portfolio of popular candy brands   given warren buffett’s affection for popular food brands in his dividend portfolio here let’s take a closer look at tootsie roll to see if this dividend king could be an appealing longterm investment   business overview founded in  by leo hirschfield in chicago illinois tootsie roll is the maker of famous candy brands as tootsie roll tootsie pops child’s play caramel apple pops charms blowpop junior mints charleston chew sugar daddy sugar babies andes razzles and dubble bubble   source tootsie roll annual report   it sells its products primarily through  candy and grocery brokers to over  supermarkets variety stores dollar stores chain grocers and drug chains in the us as well as numerous outlets in canada and mexico which are its largest foreign markets   the company also sells in europe the middle east and asia but the us is its largest market accounting for roughly  of total product revenue   business analysis tootsie roll’s large portfolio of wellknown brands generally means that its sales are steady in all types of economic environments which is important for a company that has become famous for clockworklike annual dividend increases   that being said like most food companies tootsie roll isn’t a fastgrowing company in fact sales peaked in  and have been gradually declining ever since   source simply safe dividends   fortunately management has proven effective at maximizing the company’s economies of scale and cutting costs in recent years   in fact thanks to its specialized highspeed equipment and highly automated manufacturing facilities the company has been able to generate steady improvements in margins and returns on shareholder capital   this is courtesy of the company launching its “enterprise resource planning” system or erp in  this corporate turnaround plan was based on using advanced analytics to help managers streamline and maximize the flexibility of the company’s manufacturing systems and supply chain     in fact today tootsie roll enjoys some of the industry’s highest profitability   sources morningstar and gurufocus   going forward the company has four opportunities to stabilize and return to moderate sales growth  the first is launching new product lines such as cella dips chocolate covered whole dried cherries and caramel marshmallow sugar babies   the second is increased distributions of existing products especially in emerging markets such as india and china where a fastgrowing middle class could fuel a large increase in per capita candy consumption   third the company is revamping its advertising budget away from more traditional routes such as tv and print and towards a greater focus on social media such as twitter facebook and instagram   this shift is intended to increase its brand awareness and popularity with millennials and america’s youth market   and finally the company can continue to grow through acquisitions as it has over the past  years when it purchased such wellknown brands as andes dubble bubble junior mints and dots   key risks while tootsie roll’s status as a dividend king is worthy of respect there are nonetheless several major risks to owning this stock   the most obvious is that while the company’s ability to boost its margins over time with increasing use of automation and cost cutting is impressive there are limits to how how high margins can go especially given that its key ingredients such as sugar and coco are highly cyclical commodities   which means that at some point tootsie roll’s dividend growth prospects will slow unless it can turnaround its declining sales   unfortunately the us its largest and most important market is largely saturated meaning that organic sales growth potential is pretty much limited to matching  to  population growth   however that may not prove the case if shifting consumer sentiment specifically away from high sugar snacks results in weaker future candy sales   and while foreign markets can serve as a good potential source of growth remember that the global candy industry is massively competitive dominated by giants such as hershey’s hsy mondelez international mdlz and nestle nsrgy   these wellcapitalized rivals are potentially able to better compete in fastergrowing emerging markets with advertising budgets orders of magnitude larger than tootsie roll’s as well as potentially better knowledge of local tastes   that means that the company’s best bet to achieve stronger top line sales growth is through acquisitions which always come at the risk of overpaying and underperforming on execution ie failing to achieve expected synergies   finally anyone interested in tootsie roll should know that the company although public since  is effectively a private company under the total control of the gordon family including the current chairwoman and ceo yearold ellen gordon   source tootsie roll annual report   ms gordon took over control of the company from melvin gordon in  upon the death of the yearold ceo who had run the company for over  years   normally strong insider ownership is a good thing as is very long management tenure because it aligns the incentives of management with those of shareholders and means that executives have plenty of experience in achieving steady growth   however in this case tootsie roll due to its dual class share system is entirely under the control of the gordon family this is because ms gordon’s father william rubin took over a large controlling interest in sweets company of america tootsie roll’s precursor in the ’s after the death of its founder   source motley fool   which means that today ellen gordon controls  of the voting rights in tootsie roll giving her absolute say in all corporate policies thanks to her almost exclusive ownership of the company’s class b shares which have  times the voting rights of common stock these shares were created in the ’s to ensure the couple’s lock on power   critics of the gordons including shareholders who have periodically sued management over the years claim that the gordon’s have abused this absolute power by paying themselves lavishly in both salary and benefits   for example in  mr and mrs gordon were paid  million in salary made use of the company jet for private reasons flying between their primary home in massachusetts and chicago to the tune of  million and had the company pay for their  per month chicago apartment where they stayed part time when working from the corporate headquarters   all told that meant that the couple’s compensation  was  million  of the company’s total revenue that year   in addition ms gordon isn’t a big fan of transparency and as a result the company doesn’t do conference calls issue guidance of any kind or even have an investor relations page   in other words anyone owning shares of tootsie roll has to accept the fact that they are completely at the mercy of nontransparent management who can do almost anything it wants as well as pay itself whatever it likes top five executives were paid  million in  or  of revenue   tootsie roll dividend safety we analyze  years of dividend data and  years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend   our dividend safety score answers the question “is the current dividend payment safe” we look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical eps and fcf payout ratios debt levels free cash flow generation industry cyclicality roic trends and more   dividend safety scores range from  to  and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least  since tracking the data companies cutting their dividends had an average dividend safety score below  at the time of their dividend reduction announcements     we wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how dividend safety scores are calculated what their realtime track record has been and how to use them for your portfolio here   tootsie roll has a dividend safety score of  which suggests that the company offers one of the safest and most dependable dividends on wall street   that’s not surprising given its year payout growth history   in fact tootsie roll has paid an uninterrupted quarterly dividend for  years and has also paid an annual  annual stock dividend for the past half century   this kind of steady performance and high dividend security is due to three main factors   the first being that food companies in general have very stable if slow growing sales earnings and cash flows after all even during recessions people need to eat and candy is a low cost indulgence that generally isn’t highly cyclical   next management has been very conservative with the company’s dividend growth maintaining very low eps and free cash flow payout ratios below  most years     with the annual cash dividend consuming only about  of any year’s eps and about  of free cash flow the payout is extremely well insulated against any unexpected negative events such as a sharp spike in commodity prices or currency swings which would ding earnings   finally we can’t forget the importance of a strong balance sheet which offers the company plenty of flexibility to both invest in future growth as well as continue rewarding investors with the steady payout growth for which tootsie roll is famous   as you can see tootsie roll’s enjoys a pristine fortresslike balance sheet with no debt a substantial cash position enough to cover nearly seven years of dividends and one of the strongest current ratios shortterm assetsshortterm liabilities not just in the industry but of any company on wall street     in fact when we compare tootsie roll’s metrics against its industry peers things look even better   sources morningstar fast graphs simply safe dividends   that’s because this is a highly capital intensive industry generally marked by a very high leverage ratio debtebitda and low current ratios   in contrast tootsie roll’s lack of debt and high current ratio mean that if it were ever to issue bonds such as to make a large acquisition it would likely receive a high investmentgrade rating that would allow it plentiful access to very cheap growth capital   tootsie roll’s dividend growth our dividend growth score answers the question “how fast is the dividend likely to grow” it considers many of the same fundamental factors as the safety score but places more weight on growthcentric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios scores of  are average  or higher is very good and  or lower is considered weak   tootsie roll’s dividend growth score of  indicates that it has above average dividend growth potential however that’s largely due to its low payout ratios and not necessarily because of a history of fast dividend growth     going forward tootsie roll should be capable of  to  organic sales growth which it can boost to  to  through acquisitions   combined with ongoing margin expansion from cost cutting and larger of economies of scale as well as steady  to  net share buybacks  annually over the past  years tootsie roll might be able to generate longterm eps growth of  to    and because its payout ratios are so low tootsie roll could provide dividend investors with somewhat faster payout growth should management want to along the lines of  to  over the coming years   of course this is merely the company’s potential earnings and dividend outlook whether or not tootsie roll manages to achieve it depends on stabilizing its declining sales returning to top line growth and rational decisionmaking from the management team if sales continue declining than shareholders should only expect  to  payout growth going forward   valuation over the past year tootsie roll has underperformed the sp  by about  however that doesn’t mean its valuation is attractive in fact the stock’s valuation appears quite rich   for example tr’s forward pe ratio is  more than double the sp ’s  it’s also much higher than its industry peers who have a median forward pe ratio of    and while tootsie roll has never been especially cheap over the past  years its median forward pe ratio was  today’s valuation looks especially stretched   in other words while tootsie roll’s industry leading profitability and impressive dividend growth record mean it probably deserves a market premium today’s share price represents an  premium to its rivals which is probably not warranted given its slow growth potential   meanwhile the current cash yield of  while in line with its historic  yield over the past  years is only about half that of the broader sp  which yields    in addition it’s far below the industry median yield of  in other words tootsie roll’s low payout doesn’t offer investors much especially considering that the company isn’t exactly experiencing fast earnings growth   now in fairness the company’s annual  stock dividend does mean that investors can probably achieve longterm total returns of  to   total yield   to  potential earnings growth with  to  being the more likely conservative estimate   while that may be decent total return potential especially for a dividend king the fact remains that tr’s forward pe ratio carries significant risk especially when combined with some of the company’s questionable management practices   conclusion while there is a lot to like about tootsie roll at the same time the company has major issues it needs to deal with most notably its weakening top line and potential succession issues when ms gordon becomes unable to fulfill her duties   when combined with a very low cash yield unlike some of the best high dividend stocks here modest payout growth prospects that make it a weaker income growth stock and a potentially frightening valuation i simply can’t recommend tootsie roll for any diversified dividend portfolio   that’s especially true when there are far better dividend aristocrat alternatives which offer more yield stronger longterm dividend growth
