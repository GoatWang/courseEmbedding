performance  saybrook capital investment counselors     saybrook capital performance      return saybrook stocks  saybrook portfolio  sp   dow jones industrial average  msci world ex  us index  barclays us aggregate bond index  hfri hedge fund composite index    the performance numbers for saybrook capital are based on the results of a composite of fully discretionary accounts which contain stocks bonds and cash and have no restrictions on minimum yield or percent of the portfolio invested in common stocks the annual performance figure for saybrook is calculated as a dollarweighted average of the performance of each of these accounts the saybrook portfolio results are computed to reflect the payment of investment management fees performance is net of fees the saybrook stocks performance is compiled by measuring the portion of these representative accounts invested in stocks unlike the saybrook portfolio performance these numbers do not reflect the payment of investment management fees since fees are deducted from cash balances saybrook�s longterm record is compared to that of the sp  total return including dividends because the latter is the most commonly accepted index of performance for us equities since this index represents a  investment in a broad range of stocks while saybrook capital�s portfolios are sometimes not fully invested our managed accounts tend to be less volatile than the broad market averages which means they often rise less in ascending markets and decline somewhat less in falling markets moreover while saybrook�s index of performance has been positive on an annual basis during this period there is definitely no assurance that a portfolio will not decline in the future in a sharply down stock market our accounts will probably lose some value long term performance chart        saybrook capital investment counsel and management site design by graphic image group market commentary  saybrook capital investment counselors     market

capital investment counsel and management site design by graphic image group investment goals  saybrook capital investment counselors     investment goals for our clients • expand capital and income at a rate well in excess of inflation thus achieving a meaningful real rate of return • preserve principal in an era of volatile markets   longterm record since the firm was founded in  our cumulative returns have exceeded the sp  benchmark saybrook capital’s longerterm performance as well as our results during the recent years of down markets demonstrates the firm’s success in pursuing our investment goals mitigating losses during market declines has been the key reason for this achievement for instance the broad market experienced three years of significantly negative returns from  to  and saybrook capital’s average account had a cumulative positive return over the same time during the credit crisis beginning in  nearly all asset classes and stocks declined significantly in  our clients had less exposure to severe market losses in part due to the avoidance of the financial sector our focus on highquality companies and our willingness to hold cash balances saybrook capital also recognizes the opportunities in challenging markets to invest in exceptional companies at reduced cost we have provided meaningful real growth through turbulent investment eras   equity strategy

realized investments news contact investor portal corporateopportunityfunds strategy our funds invest in lower middle market companies with operational or capital structure complexity that causes many investors to shy away these situations are often undervalued in the marketplace and present highly attractive investment opportunities the catalyst for the investment opportunity can be financial or operational distress a complicated capital structure involving difficulttovalue securities or a dysfunctional ownership group our goal in each situation is to establish the downside protection of a debt investment while creating the potential for an equitytype return we view management as critical to the success of each of our investments  when we have a successful outcome we seek to have management win alongside us the recent economic crisis and the resulting changes to the financial industry have significantly restricted the capital that is available to lower middle market companies
