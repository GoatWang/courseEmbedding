choicestermssettingsactivity log facebook   blogusjeff kearl — founders circle blogusjeff kearl   jeff kearltaking a stance on valueall of us are out to build sustainable businesses and household brand names but when i look across many emerging product companies i keep seeing an over focus on customer acquisition in expensive online channels there are several unhealthy side effects to this here are a few of them jeff kearl   founder chairman  ceo stance  circle member the best brands are built through good old fashioned word of mouth discovery and this takes patiencepaid customers are worth less than organically acquired ones at stance there’s a dramatic difference in repeat purchase rates between naturally acquired and paid or persuaded customerswhen people discover a great brand product or service they enjoy sharing it with those closest to them they generally explain why they perceive your value proposition to be good and add their testimonials this is very powerful and a hallmark of nearly every brand we admire today the problem is these onetoone endorsements tend to happen slowly for most brands with an exception occurring when the product or service is incredibly disruptive such as uber skype or spotify  the opposite of this is when a company solicits and persuades a new customer to do business with them through an advertisement—and often through a discount offer—thus robbing them of the eventual personal discovery experience they would have had through one of their friends or family you effectively trade off a personal onetoone endorsement in the future in exchange for a persuaded customer available from advertising todaythis isn’t to say that customer acquisition can’t play a role in your growth or that you can’t create conditions to enable natural word of mouth marketing but too often i see emerging companies using google facebook podcasts and the like to buy customers seemingly as the extent of their strategiestheir presentations are full of cohort data they feel validated when they show high topline growth which in turn attracts investors they may even show what appears to be great ltv databut great investor slides often lead to more venture capital to spend on customer acquisition building brands and insanely great products take time and i argue that introducing customers to your brand exclusively through direct response ads will have dangerous longterm side effects in the form of unsustainable economics and ultimately customer churn it may take several years to manifest but eventually competitive pressures changing capital markets or your own balance sheet will reveal that this growth strategy was fool’s goldpaid acquisition addictioni’m not the first person to observe this but as common sense isn’t always common practice i’ll continue i saw a presentation by bill gurley at the benchmark portfolio conference in  where he effectively compared adwords to a highly addictive drug this was over  years agocompanies become addicted to paid customer acquisition because no one ever turns off revenue—unless they run out of cash for acquisition you might as well move the expense from opex to cogs because it’s never going away at best it’s a significant permanent expense that will likely go up over time because media is a commodity that goes up in price as more advertisers join the network at worst it was a mirage and your cacltv model was wrong because it was based on a short history and you didn’t factor in decayso why do companies do it well paid acquisition is formulaic and therefore relatively easy creating a brand that resonates with customers designing great products and finding organic ways to introduce customers to your company are all very difficultlow gross margins and higher operating expenses as a percent of revenuea quick study of publicly traded consumer brands such as nike lululemon michael kors and under armour reveals that their gross margins and operating expenses all fall within fairly narrow ranges these businesses are at scale and therefore different than a startup at the same time every consumer product startup will eventually need to have their numbers in similar ranges in order to make a profitunfortunately another common trait i see is that many emerging product companies have much lower gross margins and much higher operating expenses than the public group by low i mean gross margins less than  which is lower than nearly the entire public comp groupreal gross margin includes duties freight and a margin for distressed inventory unless the business has an unfair advantage that will eventually allow for exceptionally low opex less than  low gross margin signals a business with little future value because low gross margin businesses struggle to produce real cash flowas we all know eventually every business is valued on expected future cash production unfortunately up until very recently today’s venture capital market has been typified by huge rounds at high valuations into unprofitable companies with high growth rates—which again are often due to large paid acquisition budgetsit’s a cycle that allows companies to become very large without ever fundamentally validating their businessesi don’t like to pick on any company especially one where i wasn’t in the board meetings but since they’re gone fab appears to be the quintessential example hundreds of millions of dollars were transferred from venture capitalists to fab and from fab to google and facebook yes there was a payroll and rent but the acquisition spend was historic for a startup the resulting growth obscured what was happening in that business and whether it had a durable modelexcept in the most competitive and clearly lucrative market opportunities i prefer a different approach grow organically and profitably until the value proposition is proven and then accelerateas an entrepreneur time is the most valuable thing i have i want to know as soon as possible if the value proposition works if it doesn’t i need to pivot or shut down and try another idea the worst situation is a startup that confuses a repeatable value proposition with validation from a cacltv model or a venture capitalistas the entrepreneur you could spend years building a business that’s never going to work i maintain that when startups build paid acquisition as their first channel the company’s real value proposition—and its ability to produce cash flow—remain unproven don’t be deceived as my friend bob kagle likes to say “it’s easier to raise venture capital than get money from a full price customer”    microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your browser history must allow firstparty and thirdparty cookies and you must have

jeff kearl’s sima surf summit keynote address may   by gabriela aoun cocktail hour at sima surf summit’s opening night photo steele the th annual sima surf summit kicked off wednesday evening at the marquis los cabos hotel stance president john wilson opened the evening with the th annual toast to late sima chairman emeritus dick baker wilson said that if baker were here today he would likely advise four things “be bold and take risks stay committed and passionate to surfing and the industry that surrounds it embrace change as opportunity and you guys better have fun” stance president john wilson led the th annual toast to dick baker photo steele stance ceo jeff kearl delivered the keynote speech he posed a question that no doubt will be a theme of the threeday summit why are so many brands suffering when surf participation is seemingly at an alltime high and millennials have some of the strongest purchasing power in history kearl’s discussion was wideranging offering several case studies including that of stance itself as well as insight from steve jobs’ marketing philosophy and from brands outside of surf such as bonobos kearl largely credited stance’s initial success to asking one question “what category can be made interesting where is there room for differentiation in a homogenized genre” in stance’s case the answer was socks but kearl still sees opportunity in other categories he cited the examples of under armour and lululemon both of which also started with a “hero product” and did not diversify their product line until  years in jeff kearl offered several case studies including his involvement in the founding of stance photo steele kearl then moved on to marketing citing a transcendent speech by steve jobs when he launched apple’s “think different” campaign “the best brands stand for something more” says jobs “we have to be really clear on what we want the world to know about us” jobs offered the example of nike which sold shoes but never mentioned shoes in its marketing instead honoring great athletes kearl then posed the same question to brands within the industry “what do our brands stand for” he asked and perhaps more important even if a brand knows what it stands for have they successfully delivered that message to the consumer after marketing kearl turned to the issue of retail there is a widespread assumption that ecommerce is destroying retail but kearl pointed out that a  of ecommerce in  was from amazon skewing the statistics on actual growth and b while traditional and multibrand retail may be suffering innovative retail ideas are thriving he cited the examples of bonobos which uses “guideshops” to direct consumers to buy online and shoes of prey which uses retail presence in nordstrom for brand awareness despite being rooted in online purchasing among many other thought starters that kearl posited the one that perhaps seemed most crucial to him is for the surf industry to catch up to the youth’s changing buying behavior “we are not in the flow” kearl said referring to the way a typical yearold finds brands and makes purchases the industry must adjust to social mediaintegrated purchasing as well as an expectation from the youth culture that purchasing be as convenient as pushing a button on their mobile phone he made references to stance’s plans to put more focus on instagram as a growth opportunity though the list of areas where kearl saw room for industry improvement was long he was also optimistic the surf industry is made up of people “who created careers doing the thing they loved” he said that lends itself to a continuous source of creative inspiration which can be capitalized on when facing the challenges of the digital age more on jeff kearl more
