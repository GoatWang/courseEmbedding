appellant v nortel inc arne m soreide james iaderose lynn soreide donna kim aka donna sottile and nor communications appellees district court of appeal of florida fourth district june   rehearing denied april 7  attorneys appearing for the case steven j gutter of kahn  gutter plantation for appellant herbert b dell of herbert b dell pa fort lauderdale for appellee lynn soreide per curiam dylan investments obtained a judgment against arne soreide and his whollyowned corporation nortel inc it then brought these supplementary proceedings against the judgment debtors and arnes wife lynn soreide the trial court entered judgment in favor of lynn we affirm dylan nortels landlord was awarded judgment for breach of lease dylan asserts that lynn is indebted to it by virtue of fraudulent transfers from nortel inc through a separate corporation accutel communications inc whollyowned by lynn accutel occupied the premises after nortel ceased doing business the resolution of this appeal hinges on whether there exists competent substantial evidence supporting the trial courts conclusion rejecting dylans claim that accutel was a business continuation or successor of nortel the trial court made these findings at trial plaintiff presented the following exhibits a the  tax return for nortel inc b the 7 tax return for nortel inc c the  tax return for accutel communications inc d the 7 tax return for accutel communications inc e arne and lynn soreides joint 7 tax return and f financing statement regarding purchase and financing of a leased  mercedes the parties stipulated that there would be no forensic accountant and no evidence of such an accounting was presented to this court plaintiff presented no expert testimony to establish that any specific asset transfers were made from nortel inc to accutel communications inc    the undisputed testimony established that nortel inc entered into the lease with dylan investments inc nortel inc had desks chairs and nominal office equipment which were sold for  after the business failed the assets reflected on nortel incs tax returns were abandoned after the business was downsized and left its office in broward county florida plaintiff presented no testimony to establish the fair market value of the assets referenced on nortel incs tax returns and the testimony regarding any alleged transfer of assets to or used by accutel communications inc was disputed and was not specific hence this court rejects that testimony there is no evidence that lynn personally participated in nortels business and there is evidence that accutel conducted an entirely different business than nortel there is also evidence that accutel was incorporated prior to the dylan lease and that both companies carried on their business simultaneously with accutel utilizing a portion of the leased space perusal of the transcript and the tax forms reflects proof of only these nebulous at best transfers tying nortel to lynn a tax writeoff for the abandoned nortel furnishings and equipment on lynns 7 tax return and a profit distribution to lynn for accutels business testimony linking accutel to nortel receivables was rejected by the trial court although there is a link between the abandoned furniture and lynn via a tax credit on a joint return for a depreciated loss because both corporations were s corporations both arne and lynn were eligible for the tax credit as husband and wife there is no link between accutels profit and nortels receivables without testimony explicitly rejected by the trial court furthermore dylan correctly notes that expert testimony is not required to prove a fraudulent transfer however the record does not indicate that the trial court based its conclusion that there was no fraudulent transfer on the lack of expert testimony as such we conclude that the trial court did not err by concluding that no fraudulent transfer occurred as the evidence at hand supported the trial courts conclusion that accutel was not a business continuation or successor of nortel in reaching this conclusion it was unnecessary for this court to consider the parties statuses and obligations under the florida uniform transfer act and we reach no conclusion on this issue as a result affirmed gunther stone and stevenson jj concur comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom
