curly coarse eyes green paula begoun no longer writes for beautypedia there is a staff that writes expert reviews but its unclear as to what makes them experts they arent cosmetics chemists manufacturers dermatologists estheticians or nurses they are marketers for paulas choice cosmetics paula begoun sold her private paulas choice company to bertram capital a few years ago at that time marketing got beautypedia and paula became the face of the brand the products have risen a great deal in price since then but they are more widely sold paula begoun is one of the most brilliant cosmetics marketers of the th and st century her powerful inverse marketing has caused legions of fans who have absolutely no idea what theyre talking about to quote paulas reviews as if they are white papers paula begoun is a marketing genius first advancing her beauty bibles then her privately owned brands for private label cosmetics by contrasting her label with ubiquitous brands like murad and perricone people believed her less expensive products were better because they contained ingredients paula praised in her reviews i love the fact that paula begoun taught women how to research ingredients how to look out for what might be personally harmful and not to believe expensive means greatbeautypedia has begun allowing users to write reviews which may be an attempt to get people to use the site againwhich in turn directs them to paulas choice of course many many of the reviewers disagree with the expert reviews which proves the entirely subjective nature of cosmetics usage regardless of whether or not evil cosmetics fiends package face creams in jars or put drops of lavender oil in their concoctions beautypedias references should be taken with a grain of salt they often cite in vitro tests tests on cell cultures not skin tests done from product consumption not use on skin etc however if you have any skin diseases disorders sensitivities allergiesthis is definitely the place to go before you buy something that may hurt you its easy for people like me with resistant genetically strong skin to think some of the reviews are ridiculous without having experienced the constant worry of skin damage andor irritation i can say something like i love noxzema and witch hazel is one of my favorite skin care ingredients many people could damage their skin if they think my reviews apply to everyone so beautypedia a safe resource for those with sensitive skinlike the previous reviewer i am a huge fan of cosdnacom  report abuse  of  people found this helpful snowshoe on   pm more reviews by snowshoe age  skin combination fair not sure hair brunette wavy coarse eyes brown while beautypedia is a massive resource i do not have  faith in their reviews due to their obvious conflict of interest even though beautypedia claims its no longer affiliated with paulas choice its very suspicious that all the paulas choice products are rated  stars or higher especially when several of these products have received less than stellar reviews both here and elsewhere on the internet ill stick with cosdna for ingredient analysis and makeupalley for honest reviews report abuse

statements about the harm some ingredients may cause that are debatable at best if you would like it broken down for you just google robert tisserand and lavender oil he breaks it down while still citing references to every claim take all information from beautypedia with a large grain of salt report abuse alisonmarie on   pm more reviews by alisonmarie age  skin acneprone fair not sure hair blond wavy medium eyes grey get  off your paulas choice order httpsgooglmtpizbeautypedia is pretty helpful if youre willing to look past some of the bias and overlycritical comments paula makes in favor of her own products while i do happen to really like a lot of paulas choice products there are plenty of other great products at the departmentdrug store that perform similarly paula seems to be very reluctant to give some products that seem just fine a satisfactory review due to one little ingredient or formulation defect that really doesnt effect its integrity which i find annoying she can be pretty helpful though in pointing out really irritating ingredients in certain products report abuse  of  people found this helpful biancaredhead on   am more reviews by biancaredhead age  skin combination fairmedium not sure hair red other other eyes brown paulas choice uses science to create their products  i buy the acne toner from her line bc its the only one on the market that does not contain alcohol or witch hazel birth known to be not god for your skin i like that fragrance is always mentioned to be a problem these companies put fragrance in their products to mask chemical odour and to make the products more appealing yes hert products are expensive if you live in canada but thats only bc of the exchange rate years ago it would have been the other way around arbonne is rated as bad for the most part well sure those products are jam packed with irritants as an example the genius pads primarily all alcohol and at that price  its bc the company keeps giving mercedes benzs away so they need to charge a big premium for their products  they do have a few products i do like though ffrom their makeup line calm moisturizer and eye cream  ive tried their protein shakes but again way overpriced report abuse ziggymama on   pm more reviews by ziggymama age   over skin sensitive fair neutral hair silver curly medium eyes grey the review by babs just shows that it isnt advisable to trust anyone over your own experience i have extremely picky sensitive skin ive used paulas products for years some are hg for me the skin recovery replenishing moisturizer saved my eyes some are meh some my skin wont toleratethough thats my goofy skin not necessarily the product ive been having issues with some seb derm patches the last couple of years apparently related to menopause and perhaps overenthusiastic chin plucking with that ive had to seek out and use alternative products when its irritated and peeling i must use very bland products most of paulas contain too many actives during those periods note that despite having great local access i must order most of these products online after hours of research and many that dont worki do get annoyed with some of paulas hobbyhorses especially the whole sunscreen thing im violently allergic to all chemical sunscreen and if i used physical sunscreen daily id be broken out all the time fortunately i live in seattle but i appreciate her attitude about fragrance in products i cant even use perfume soso this is just to say if your skin isnt doing well maybe change it up i know how hard it can be to figure out whats working and what isnt lets just say if your eyes swelled shut when you made an error about cosmetics wouldnt you be cautious i learned my lesson early from allowing people to mess with my face makeup and having violent allergic reactions that would then mess up my skin for weeks if not months i will say i do love makeup alley spend way too much time here but its time well spent and though its encouraged my makeup addiction its also saved me a lot of money not buying things that sound better than they are report abuse  of  people found this helpful babs on   pm more reviews by babs age  skin combination fair not sure hair brown other other eyes hazel sighwhere do i start ive put off reviewing this for a long time because i didnt want my bitterness to cloud my judgementits still painfullol i discovered one of paulas dont go to the cosmetics counter without me books and also her beauty bible a few years ago which quickly led to of course beautypedia i was obsessed and became a skin care fanaticstarted following all her rules to the letterthrew out all my products that didnt receive a good or best rating from herwhich were almost all of them and as a product hoarder that was a lot of loot wasted i stopped buying creams in jars i avoided anything with alcohol in it i avoided anything without sunscreen includedeven make up i stopped using anything with lavender or even lavender scented even though its one of my favourite smells in the world i stopped using anything with fragrance even bodywashwhich didnt even make sense since i was still wearing perfume on my skin which has fragrance and alcohol perhaps even lavender lol yikes anywayi started making lists of all the things she approved ofwhich didnt leave me with much to choose fromespecially since i live in a very small town with limited places to shop i pretty much have shoppers and walmart the products she recommended were either her own expensive or hard to find brands or maybe a couple olay products so i tried olayunbeknownst to me at the timeim allergic to niacinamide which is in all olay products and most of paulas so my skin broke out in a rash which i mistook for pimples even more frustrated with my skin care and out of any other options since she vetoed most products by neutrogena aveeno marcellemy regular brands which actually do work for mei caved and started ordering her stuff i spent a lot of moneyespecially to have it shipped to canada and having it converted into us dollars her products did not agree with meat all probably due to the niacinamidei was using her hydralight linemy face developed hard painful bumps under the skin welts you might say and very hideous redness may i add this is the summer i got married with completely ruined skinanyhow so perfectly good products thrown out money wasted on her products wrecked skin and redness which lasted about a yearthis is what i received for my faithful followinghowever why give her site a  instead of a one because i did learn some very useful information from her site i learned how to read ingredients lists and what most ingredients actually are i learned to avoid menthol or menthyl lactate like the damn plague because my skin is allergic to that also but i never made the connection until i read about it being an irritant from her advice that in itself was priceless so many face washes contain it and i would always break out in a rash and think it was acne up to that pointso anyway i check her site from time to time now mostly out of curiosityeven though i find theyre getting slower and slower adding product reviewsby the time theyre finally reviewed ive already had the product for months i went back to using whatever the hell i want jar packaging fragrance lavender some alcoholbut i always keep her advice in the back of my mind and now i prefer reading reviews on this lovely site report abuse  of  people found this helpful chocolateema on   pm more reviews by chocolateema age  skin combination fair not sure hair blond other other eyes blue let me just start off by saying most of the bad reviews beautypedia gets are because the reviewers dont really know what they are talking about here are the things i keep reading that make me feel that way beautypedia always gives paulas choice products the highest ratings um hello why would they make any product that wouldnt live up to their  star standards they always push their own products this is mostly true but what company wouldnt do that its just business  just because they suggest one of their products over another that is very similar doesnt mean you have to buy it  they give products i love  work great for me low ratings so they obviously dont know what they are talking about just because your skin looks plump and smooth overnight for example doesnt mean there arent harmful ingredients in there that arent harming your skin in other ways longterm  they give products i love low ratings because of skin irritants  fragrances when they dont irritate my skin a lot of times when they are saying an ingredient is known to be a skin irritant such as fragrance essential oils etc it means it causes oxidation they make your skin cells decay which you cannot see unless you look under a microscope companies must pay them to give their products high ratings if you actually read the reviews and researched the reasons why they gave it a low score you would quickly see that isnt true  they knock products down just because of their high price all they are doing is saying hey there are other products that do the exact same thing for less or that there isnt anything in the product that justifies the high price all they are doing is trying to save you moneywith all of that being said if you absolutely love a product that they gave a low score its perfectly fine to keep using it just dont knock them down because i have a feeling they know what they are talking about more than the majority of us  report abuse rachkat on   pm more reviews by rachkat age  skin dry fair cool hair black wavy fine eyes green interesting notes on her site i used to read her religiously after trying a few of her recommendations ie olay loreal garnier creams recently milani eyeshadow that they rave aboutmy face itched and burned once i became more informed on ingredients i found alot of her recommendations are highly synthetic or biased based on one ingredient i get the feeling she might get kickbacks from alot of these companies of course i have no proof but a girl is allowed her thoughts i think her team experts arent really experts just regular joes working a joband the one sidedmy stuff is greati tried several of her products as well and promptly returned them because they caused itching and burning she poopoos alot of products that have worked wonders for my skin basing her opinion on one ingredient ie sunday riley luna oil is bad i have great alternative retinols blah blahgranted its expensive but it works for me just not because of the retinols but because of all the other oils in it im pretty sick of seeing her everywhere thats why i come here  although i dont post often report abuse  of  people found this helpful smoothtalkin on   am more reviews by smoothtalkin age  skin sensitive fair cool hair blond straight fine eyes brown i no longer look to paulas choice for unbiased reviews after several products she rated poorly performed very well for me if she didnt try to push her own product line within a separate product review i might be able to trust her more her team has been wrong about products being discontinued on several occasions and i have corrected them via twitter they were kind enough to thank me but if a consumer can reach out to s brand via social media for accurate information why cant her team keep with database up to date with their directconnectuons i also feel they do not moderate comments fairly sometimes they respond with critical rehtoric and other times they ignore symptoms of active ingredients a specific example involves neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair her team tears it apart claiming that the amount of retinol is ineffective but after only three days of use my skin is red tender and flakey  all side effects of retinol some one in the comment section claims they experience flaking and the paulas choice team commented that this could be a side effect of the retinol andor the fragrance flaking is a side effect of prescription stregth retin a which is fragrance free it appears her team refuses to credit a product with effect ingredients and instead points out its additives her own retinol products also cause flaking that what retinol does and thats a sign that its workingin order to minimize the negative side effects wait  minutes after washing your face before applying a retinoid and apply an additional moisturizer on top afterwards if you are still sensitive apply an additional layer of moisturizer before applying a retinoid and then apply moisturizer afterwards these steps are designed to minimize the amount of retinoids absorbed by the skin alternate applications or start with only one or two applications a

really geeking out about people i get to meet in the beauty world or products that i get to try this is something my husband doesn’t understand unless i put it in terms of sports or something similar a month or so ago i was contacted by paula’s choice the comsetic cop author of don’t go to the cosmetic counter without me to review some of their products  i kind of freaked out in a good way to my husband and he looked at me like i was kind of a psycho so i said to him “it would be like you getting contacted by the oregon ducks or the ers saying that they had a signed football for you”  maybe that is a little dramatic of me to say but still i have respected paula’s opinion on product and ingredients way before i ever ventured into the world of beauty blogging so i was really excited that they wanted me to review their products on my blog with that said like any skincare review i like to be using the product for a few weeks to see how my skin does and see what i like or dislike about it  i have been on these products for over a month so i definitely feel like i got to really “know” them skin balancing oil reducing cleanser what this is “a skin balancing oilreducing cleanser is formulated for normal to oilycombination skin and those prone to blemishes” how to use “use morning and evening splash the face and eyes generously with tepid to slightly warm water apply a small amount of cleanser to your face and eye area with vigorous yet gentle circular motions rinse well repeat or use with a clean washcloth to remove heavy makeup” my experience  first off this is one of the largest cleanser bottles i have ever seen which makes for a product that will last you a long time in addition to that i really liked how it got off all of my makeup easily and that i could use it around my eye area without fear of it making me go blind it also is fragrance free which is a major plus for me price  for a oz bottle  killer value skin balancing pore reducing toner what this is “a toner that has been specially formulated for normal to oilycombination skin it is also a good option for acneprone skin” how to use “use morning and evening after cleansing apply to a cotton pad and gently stroke over face and neck do not rinse” my experience honestly i am not a huge toner person and more times than not i skip this step but while using this my perspective shifted and i have an all new appreciation for them– at least this one anyways usually when i use a toner it strips my skin making the moisturizing step  percent essential  but this one is different because it actually kept my skin moisturized while removing last traces of makeup price   oz what skin perfecting  bha liquid this is this is a “ bha salicylic liquid exfoliant rapidly exfoliates both the skin’s surface and inside the pore reshaping the pore lining unclogging pores and improving skin cell turnover rate” how to use  “can be used once or twice daily after cleansing and toning you may apply a moisturizer or sunscreen over it as well” my experience i am kind of a nut when it comes to exfoliating my skin and i truly don’t think a skincare regimen is complete unless it has this step one thing i noticed first when i applied this was the slight tingle sensation i love that feeling because i know my product is working after one application my skin looked more radiant pores looked tighter and my skin had a glow but what really sold  me on this was that the party of  blackheads on my chin started to work their way up and out the door price   oz resist intensive wrinkle repair retinol serum what it is “paula’s choice resist intensive wrinklerepair retinol serum is an exclusive formula that utilizes a proprietary blend of highly stabilized retinol potent antioxidants and skinrepairing ingredients its soothing silky texture goes to work immediately to help skin of any age look and act younger with ongoing use you will see fewer wrinkles smoother skin and improved skin tone” how to use apply in the evening after cleansing toning and exfoliating smooth a few drops onto skin before or after moisturizing my experience first off  the twistopentop packaging on this serum is perfect for my busy lifestyle it’s very user friendly and it ensure my product will stay inside the container when not in use  i am a huge fan of the combination of retinol and an antioxident both essential to my skincare routine i enjoyed the texture of this product and the way it covered my entire face and neck with just one pea sized drop since using it i did notice a slight difference around my eyes it looks more hydrated and my fine lines look less prominent when i smile  although i don’t have a huge issue with fine lines and wrinkles crossing my fingers and knocking on wood  i know that the antioxidant is a freeradical buster which will keep my skin in tiptop shape price   oz killer deal resist barrier repair moisturizer with retinol what it is “resist barrier repair moisturizer contains a unique complex of ingredients proven to remodel your skin by building and preserving collagen firming skin and protecting against moisture loss the featherlight silky texture provides substantial hydration the active ingredients in the resist barrier repair moisturizer are proven to make a visible difference in the appearance of fine lines wrinkles skin tone and skin firmness” how to use apply as the very last step in your regimen my experience i am glad that this was lightweight and not a cream after using the other steps just one pump of this was all the additional moisture i needed and–once again the retinol is just an added bonus cost   oz killer deal overall skincare experience and rating one of the many reasons why i respect “paula’s choice” is because they are upfront with their ingredients and research you are getting a product formulated by someone who has researched the ins and outs of skincare to me it is clear that paula wants only the very best for your skin it also doesn’t hurt that these products are really budget friendly while still remaining high in quality after a one month trial there was no weird skin reactions or break outs my skin type normalcombo did really well and my skin looks healthy refreshed and hydrated rating i can’t live without you  points   xoxokendra     note these products were given to me for the purpose of review all thoughts

bookmarking and checking back frequently web page i was recommended this website by my cousin i am not sure whether this post is written by him as nobody else know such detailed about my trouble you’re amazing thanks wwwmilanolifecojp heya superb blog does running a blog such as this take a massive amount work i have no knowledge of programming however i had been hoping to start my own blog in the near future anyhow should you have any recommendations or techniques for new blog owners please share i understand this is off subject nevertheless i simply had to ask many thanks aj great review i’ve been considering this line and knowing the toner isn’t drying is a huge plus but looking at them now the price on the website has nearly doubled for many of these products so i’m still on the fence citizens of beauty hi aj i think that this skincare line is a great choice…but that is really weird that the pricing has gone up so much i wonder if they will have a sale soon or something thanks for you comment sarah i was thinking the same thing like how come the prices you listed are so much cheaper sine these products were provided to you for reviews were these prices provided to you from their rep the site routinely have sales of  off i have seen up to  sometimes for selected products but no where as low as yours…especially for the barrier repair or the retinol serum can you reach out to them and ask about this thanks jeanine i fought moderate acne for  years tried everything rx obagi  peels over counter proactive etc etc paulas choice has my skin clear for first time in  years  if i had known sooner could have alleviated a lot of suffering and scars tell anyone you know who struggles with acne lisa love pc products  lisa  lisawoodbeautycom kendra stanton me too
