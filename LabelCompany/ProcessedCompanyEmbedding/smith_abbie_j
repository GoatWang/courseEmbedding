working paper ceo materialism and corporate social responsibility working paper for a listing of research publications please visit the university library listing page new ceo materialism and corporate social responsibility date posted jun    we study the role of individual ceos in explaining corporate social responsibility csr scores we show that ceo fixedeffects explain  of the variation in csr scores a significant portion of which is attributable to a ceo’s “materialism” relatively high luxury asset ownership specifically firms led by materialistic ceos have lower csr scores and increases in ceos’ materialism are associated with declining scores finally csr scores in firms with nonmaterialistic ceos are positively associated with accounting profitability in contrast csr scores in firms with materialistic ceos are unrelated to profitability on average however this association is decreasing in ceo power new executives’ legal records and insider trading activities date posted jun    we examine how and why insider trading varies across senior executives and their firms as predicted the profitability of both purchases and sales are higher for “recordholder” executives those who have a record of legal infractions than for other “nonrecordholder” executives at the same firms the profitability of recordholder executives’ purchases and sales decrease significantly with proxies for strong information and governance environments suggesting that recordholders have a relatively higher propensity to exploit inside information given the opportunity to do so finally our classification of executives recordholder status can predict future returns and firmspecific information events new bank ceo materialism corporate culture and risk date posted may    we examine the extent to which bank ceos exert influence on the corporate cultures of banking organizations by investigating how the prevalence of materialistic bank ceos has evolved over time and how observed risk management policies the behavior of nonceo executives and bank tail risk vary with bank ceo materialism we document that between  and  the proportion of us banks run by materialistic ceos increased significantly in absolute terms and relative to nonfinancial firms coinciding with significant bank deregulation using an index reflecting the strength of risk management functions rmi we find that rmi is significantly lower for banks with materialistic ceos significantly increases after a nonmaterialistic ceo replaces a materialistic ceo and decreases after a materialistic ceo succeeds a nonmaterialistic one we also provide evidence consistent with nonceo executives in banks with materialistic ceos more aggressively exploiting inside trading  revision executives’ offthejob behavior corporate culture and financial reporting risk date posted mar    we examine how executives’ behavior outside the workplace as measured by their ownership of luxury goods low “frugality” and prior legal infractions is related to financial reporting risk we predict and find that ceos and cfos with a legal record are more likely to perpetrate fraud in contrast we do not find a relation between executives’ frugality and the propensity to perpetrate fraud however as predicted we find that unfrugal ceos oversee a relatively loose control environment characterized by relatively high and increasing probabilities of other insiders perpetrating fraud and unintentional material reporting errors during their tenure further cultural changes associated with an increase in fraud risk are more likely during unfrugal vs frugal ceos’ reign including the appointment of an unfrugal cfo an increase in executives’ equitybased incentives to misreport and a decline in measures of board monitoring intensity revision investment cash flow sensitivities really reflect related investment decisions date posted sep    an important unresolved issue in finance is whether the sensitivity of capital investment to internally generated cash flows reflects the impact of binding financing constraints on firms’ investment decisions we contribute new insight to this debate by providing systematic evidence that investmentcash flow sensitivity icfs primarily reflects the fundamental connection between capital investment and working capital investment as interrelated manifestations of firm growth we decompose the  new capital allocation and timely accounting recognition of economic losses date posted jan    this paper explores direct relations between corporate investment behavior and the timeliness of accounting recognition of economic losses tlr reflected in a country’s accounting regime we explicitly investigate the extent to which tlr influences investment decisions of firm managers given the asymmetric emphasis on negative outcomes inherent in tlr we hypothesize that tlr will most strongly influence investment behavior when managers face deteriorating investment environments we  transparency financial accounting information and corporate governance date posted sep    audited financial statements along with supporting disclosures form the foundation of the

institutional environment important to effective governance of firms they provide a framework for understanding the operation of accounting information in an economy discuss a broad range of important research  what determines corporate transparency date posted sep    we investigate corporate transparency defined as the availability of firmspecific information to those outside publicly traded firms

research be extended to explore more comprehensively the use of financial accounting information in additional corporate control mechanisms and  insider trading restrictions and analysts incentives to

countries for the years  to study whether analyst following increases following adoption of or the initial enforcement of insider trading legislation we document that both the intensity of analyst

research on the use of financial accounting measures in managerial incentive plans and explore future research directions we then propose that governance research be extended to explore more comprehensively the use of financial accounting information in additional corporate control mechanisms and  the sensitivity of corporate governance systems to the timeliness of accounting earnings date posted oct    the purpose of this paper is to investigate how governance systems of large public us corporations vary with information properties of numbers produced by their financial accounting systems we argue that in firms whose current accounting numbers do a relatively poor job of capturing the effects of the firms current activities and outcomes on shareholder value the accounting numbers are less effective in the governance setting we predict that such firms will substitute costly governance  an analysis of the relation between the stewardship and valuation roles of earnings date posted may    we develop an agencybased model that provides a direct theoretical connection between compensationearnings sensitivities cercs and valueearnings sensitivities ercs the model predicts that cercs are increasing in ercs this relation between valuation and stewardship derives from the fact that the capitalization rate of earnings into value also influences the marginal product of current period actions that impact current earnings our empirical tests of the model provide evidence of a  an empirical investigation of trends in the absolute and relative use of earnings in determining cas date posted jan    the purpose of this paper is to provide evidence on whether there have been changes over time in the compensationearnings relation we investigate whether there is a trend during the period  in the sensitivity of executive pay to reported earnings and in the importance of earnings relative to other information in explaining executive pay as addressed in gjesdal

to relate to what my daughter is encountering i have been in a state of panic as she recounted all the things she is experiencing in just the first semester the testimonials of the college students in abbie smiths book encouraged and reminded me that all christian college students face a choice of faith specific examples are given of how they dealt with situations and what they learned that helped them to become stronger and more dependent on their savior my daughter read it her senior year but im sending it to her to read again as now it will be more applicable was this review helpful helpful
