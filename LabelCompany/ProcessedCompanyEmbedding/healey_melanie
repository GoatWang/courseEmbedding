knowledge process expertise responsiveness negotiation skills as a firsttime homeowner i was mostly clueless and dependent upon others knowledge in the home buying process emotionally i was also anxious i knew that anyone who took me on as a client would have to be very patient and knowledgeable the process to me was really not that different from picking a husband i really wanted to find something that i liked and just “me” as nearly a year went by i went through three different realestate agents who were all recommended by friendscolleagues but there were issues after issues i was becoming really discouraged it all changed when i met melanie she said to me “this will be an entirely different experience for you” about which i was obviously skeptical at first over the next few months i was shown places that met my needs more than all the previous ones i had been shown by three other agents who also had claimed they knew the areas well how come i had never seen these places until i met melanie i was mostly impressed by melanie’s professionalism and responsiveness melanie is well spoken and well mannered she comes across as a real professional woman i was not impressed when the previous agents showed up in sneakers without being prepared taking calls and talking on the phone for a long time in the middle of showing me properties without handshakes in the first meeting looking tired and so on i remembered saying to melanie “can just about anyone become an agent” melanie is very personable she is always smiling and is always helpful most importantly she is consistently responsive even in the event of her absence she would find a way to help me or send someone else capable to help patience is a virtue melanie was always patient throughout the course of time when i had so many questions and needs for beginner’s education on home buying she did it with a smile and a friendship she continued to reach out after i settled into my new place she had helped me find i know how lucky i was to have her as a big part of my first home buying experience she definitely has a wealth of knowledge about the area and understands her clients’ needs i will continue

of the most powerful women in business announced her retirement from the company effective next june the news which came as part of an overall restructuring announcement by ceo ag lafley surprised many who thought that healey had a good shot at succeeding lafley one daybut the company is undergoing dramatic change and healey who has struggled to get the oncedynamic north america region back on track has decided to do something different retirement at pg is allowed after  years at the company which healey has completed but shes only  so dont expect to see her in a rocking chair anytime soonin an email exchange with fortune the brazilian executive mused on what that might be i firmly believe that happiness and success is not just about reaching a dream destination but more importantly its about enjoying the journey she says the past  years at pg have been an amazing journey now its time for something differentshe says shes considering everything from writing a book to working in a startup but notes that it is impossible to figure out whats next when youre in such an intense job there is virtually no time to step back reflect and consider what else you could choose to doi asked healey to offer some advice for professional women based on her long career she directed me to a speech she gave to her alma mater the university of richmond in late october entitled choose to live a life that matters there were two aspects that seemed particularly relevantfirst was the notion that authentic leadership comes from within looking at yourself in the mirror and knowing you are accountable first and foremost to yourself is a choice she said and when you get really clear about who you are this understanding will make you a more authentic leader for women in particular who often feel pressured to act like leaders they see around them rather than finding their own path this is very good advice and as someone who has watched healey in action for years i can vouch for her own authenticitythe second bit of advice surprised me the choice not to have it all far from being defeatist is extremely liberating she said slugging through a decade of work but losing touch with your family and friends or with your community creates its own sense of failure she wrotethis from a woman with a  billion pl who spends months a year on the road and yet has managed to maintain a longterm marriage and raise two kids both currently in collegebut when i thought about it for a while i realized that what she was saying was profound enough to turn the whole lean in debate on its head you can have all of what you want she is saying you just cant have everything that anyone wants—or you can try but you wont be happyheres hoping healeys next chapter gives her what she wants but not all“from the mpw cochairs” is a series where the editors who oversee the fortune most powerful women brand share their insights about women leaderscustomer servicesite mapprivacy
