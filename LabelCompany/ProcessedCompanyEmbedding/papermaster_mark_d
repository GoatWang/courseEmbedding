of the federal rules of civil procedure to enjoin defendant mark d papermaster defendant or papermaster a former ibm executive from working for and from disclosing ibms confidential information to apple inc apple ibm filed its complaint on october   including claims for breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets on october   the court granted plaintiffs application for an order to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not be ordered to bar mr papermaster from working for apple mr papermaster responded to the order to show cause in a timely fashion and the court held a preliminary injunction hearing on november   by agreement of the parties there was no live testimony at this hearing instead the record consists of the declarations and exhibits that accompanied the parties memoranda of law in support of and in opposition to plaintiffs injunction application at the hearing plaintiff upon learning for the first time that mr papermaster had already begun working for apple moved for a temporary restraining order the court granted plaintiffs motion for preliminary injunctive relief in an order dated november   promising the reasons for that order in a forthcoming opinion this is that opinion which sets forth the courts findings of facts and conclusions of law as required by rule  of the federal rules of civil procedure for the reasons in this opinion the court orders that mr papermaster be enjoined from working for or with apple until further order of the court however in consideration of the parties equities the court also finds that this case should proceed on an expedited schedule that will be addressed at an upcoming conference i facts a ibm ibm a new york corporation is one of the worlds largest technology companies with nearly  employees worldwide compl ¶  ibms business depends on its technical research and development efforts which allow it to design develop and manufacture a variety of products including microprocessors and servers id ¶  microprocessors are a type of microelectronic device that provides intelligence and functionality to electronic devices such as personal computers video game consoles intelligent handheld devices and servers id servers are highperformance computers designed to handle the needs of multiple concurrent users id to build these servers and microprocessors ibm has developed what is known as power architecture which is based on a broad array of knowhow andor technical instructions used to design electronic devices supplemental decl of rodney c adkins suppl adkins decl ¶  nl from ibms perspective power is one of the handful of architectures used to design develop and manufacture microprocessors for both large and small electronic devices id ¶  and as evidenced by its use in a wide variety of applications it is said to be superior to other architectures in its scalability its flexibility and its ability to be customized   id while ibms model emphasizes largescale products for businesses decl of blair g connelly ex c the microprocessor technology developed by ibm has wide application decl of rodney c adkins adkins decl¶  suppl adkins decl ¶  for example within the last  months ibm has developed technology that is compatible with consumer electronic products such as cellphones and mp players suppl adkins decl ¶  in particular ibm  recently revealed a new type of digital storage technology that enables mp players such as  apples ipod to store about half a million songs or  films with a lower power output id ¶ c and until two years ago ibm supplied apple with microprocessors based on its power architecture for apples personal computers id ¶  b mr papermasters year career at ibm mr papermaster a texas resident has worked at ibm for the past twentysix years decl of mark d papermaster papermaster decl ¶¶   he has spent most of his career at ibm in various product design and development roles within the systems and technology group adkins decl ¶  from  until  mr papermaster worked in microprocessor technology development eventually becoming ibms vice president of microprocessor technology development papermaster decl ¶  most of mr papermasters work in microprocessors has been focused on ibms power architecture and because of his extensive work in this area he is viewed within ibm as the top expert in power architecture compl ¶  and in the industry as an extremely wellrespected figure in the clubby world of chip design supplemental decl of stephen c madsen suppl madsen decl ex  tom krazit apple hires top ibm chip designer and blade server guru cnet news oct   most of mr papermasters work in microprocessors has involved server applications but he spent approximately five years working on microprocessor applications for personal computers papermaster decl ¶ in fact ibm has a separate vice president in microprocessor design to run ibms microprocessor development efforts for consumer electronics and embedded products ld from october  until his departure from ibm on october   mr papermaster served as vice president of ibms blade development unit a unit within the systems and technology group which designs and delivers ibms blade servers adkins decl ¶  papermaster decl ¶  compl ¶  a blade is a small thin server that fits into a rack or chassis with other blades forming a system ibm calls a bladecenter adkins decl ¶  nl each blade is a server unto itself and is often dedicated to a single application papermaster decl ¶  the blade servers which are not consumer products were first introduced in  id mr papermaster describes himself as having developed a strong reputation at ibm for his ability to lead large teams on complex projects papermaster decl ¶  he believes that he is perceived as having strong technology management skills to bring together technical experts and enable them to integrate on specific product developments id ibm apparently shared mr papermasters view as it selected mr papermaster to be a member of the integration  values team ivt at ibm an elite group that develops ibms corporate strategy compl ¶  the ivt consists of approximately  top ibm executives who are  considered to be its key leaders decl of j randall macdonald macdonald decl ¶  in fact the members of this elite group are appointed by the chairperson of ibm and include the ceo and all twenty of the companys senior executives id as a member of the ivt mr papermaster had access to highly confidential information including strategic plans marketing plans product development and longterm business opportunities for ibm id¶  adkins decl ¶  defendant states that during his time at ibm he attended four ivt meetings and only recalls reviewing materials once papermaster decl ¶¶  in addition to his participation on the ivt mr papermaster served on the technical leadership team tlt which is comprised of ibms top technical leaders and works to attract develop and retain a talented and diverse technical workforce macdonald decl ¶  as a member of the tlt mr papermaster had access to confidential information concerning ibms technical talent pipeline technical organizational capabilities and technical recruitment strategies all of which are part of ibms corporate strategy development and are highly confidential id in fact the information made available to tlt members is not made available to most ibm employees let alone the public id mr papermaster claims that he does not believe that he learned any trade secret information that would be useful to him or apple from his participation in the tlt papermaster decl ¶  c the noncompetition agreement on june   as a prerequisite to his membership in the ivt and in return for consideration to him mr papermaster executed a noncompetition agreement the noncompetition agreement contains a provision that during mr papermasters employment with ibm and for one  year following the termination of his employment  mr papermaster will not directly or indirectly within the restricted area i engage in or associate with a any business enterprise or b any significant competitor or major competitor of the company compl if  noncompetition agreement§ b in the noncompetition agreement the following are key defined terms restricted area is defined as any geographic area in the world for which mr papermaster had job responsibilities during the last twelve  months of his employment with the company compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§ d engage or associate with is defined to mean among other things acting as an associate employee member  or otherwise compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§ c business enterprise is defined as any entity that engages in  competition with the business units or divisions of the company in which mr papermaster worked at any time during the two  year period prior to the termination of his employment compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§ a mr papermaster also agreed to a nonsolicitation covenant that during his employment with ibm and for one  year following the termination of his employment  he will not directly or indirectly within the restricted area  solicit for competitive business purposes any customer of the company with which he was involved as part of his job responsibilities during the last twelve  months of his employment with the company and for the two  year period following the termination of his employment  he will not directly or indirectly within the restricted area hire solicit or make an offer to any employee of the company to be employed or perform services outside of the company compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§  b in executing the noncompetition agreement mr papermaster also made several acknowledgments including that the business in which ibm and its affiliates  are engaged is intensely competitive compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§ i a his employment by ibm has required  that he have access to and knowledge of confidential information of the company including but not limited to certain or all of the companys methods information systems plans for acquisition or disposition of products expansion plans financial status and plans customer lists client data personnel information and trade secrets of the company all of which are of vital importance to the success of the companys business compl ¶  noncompetition agreement §  a his services to the company are and will continue to be extraordinary special and unique compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§  a the company would suffer irreparable harm if he failed to comply with the noncompetition and the nonsolicitation covenants compl ¶  noncompetition agreement§  the restrictions set forth in the covenants are reasonable as to geography duration and scope compl ¶  noncompetition agreement §  d apple and its recruiting of mr papermaster apple which is headquartered in california designs manufactures and markets personal computers portable digital music players mobile communication devices and a variety of related software services peripherals and networking solutions papermaster decl ¶  two of apples many consumer products are the ipod and the iphone decl of robert mansfield mansfield decl ¶  apple also sells servers its top line is known as the xserve although sales of these products account for only redacted of apples annual revenues mansfield decl ¶  mr papermaster claims that other than the divested personal computer business that ibm had and a single sale several years ago of apples xserve product to a university he does not recall a single instance of apple being described as a competitor of ibm during his tenure at ibm papermaster decl ¶ on the other hand the record contains thirdparty industry analyses demonstrating that in fact ibm and apple are viewed as competitors as are ibm and other electronics companies that sell products to apple such as intel suppl madsen decl ex  hoovers report at  ex  merrill lynch report at  chart  in april  apple acquired pa semi a microchip design company in california with which ibm competes in the microprocessor field adkins decl ¶  in fact as noted above until  apple utilized ibms powerpc microprocessors which are based on ibms power architecture in apples personal computers id and apple contemplated using pa semis microprocessors in lieu of ibm microprocessors adkins decl ¶  moreover pa semi is believed to be developing microprocessors suitable for video gaming applications another area of potential competition with ibm id ¶  most relevant to this litigation apples ceo steven jobs has commented that pa semi is going to do systemonchips for iphones and ipods id ¶  suppl madsen decl ex  tom krazit apple hires top ibm chip designer and blade s rver guru cnet news oct   noting that mr jobs told the new york times that pa semi would be used to build chips for the iphone and ipod touch in october  apple began a search for an executive in the consumer electronics field to serve under the current senior vice president ipod division and to become the successor in that role decl of danielle lambert lambert decl ¶  for the following five months apple interviewed several candidates including mr papermaster but did not find anybody to fill the position ¶d as part of its search for the right candidate apple sought the input of some of its senior management one individual whose views were solicited was bob mansfield who serves as senior vice president of macintosh mac hardware engineering at apple and ding but in every other way is a long shot and that mr papermaster is immensely smart about microprocessor design large systems and semiconductors lambert decl ex  mr mansfield also commented that because mr papermaster had not had the benefit of an education outside of ibm he was worried about the differences in pace of development etc but not overly worried ld notwithstanding mr mansfields supportive comments apple elected not to offer the position to mr papermaster instead offering him in february or march  a position in developing the hardware for products in the area of personal computers lambert decl ¶  in september  following the release of the new ipod and iphone apple renewed its efforts to find a successor to the senior vice president for the ipodiphone division id ¶  whatever led apple to decide not to offer mr papermaster the position earlier in  apparently did not prevent it from reinterviewing mr papermaster in october  id ¶  thus mr papermaster interviewed with apple again and on october   apple offered mr papermaster a position in the ipodiphone division as senior vice president device hardware engineering which he promptly accepted id ¶  in this position mr papermaster will report to mr jobs papermaster decl ¶  at the time of the offer apple asked mr papermaster to keep the offer confidential and not to disclose the position he would be assuming at apple in which he would manage the development of consumer electronics products specifically the ipod and iphone papermaster decl ¶¶   on october   mr papermaster informed his superiors at ibm that he intended to accept a position at apple that would begin sometime in november macdonald decl ¶  papermaster decl ¶  evidently mr papermaster did not tell ibm officials of his acceptance of apples offer as on october   in an effort to persuade mr papermaster to remain at ibm the company offered him either a substantial increase in compensation to stay at ibm or one years salary in exchange for his agreement not to work at apple for one year macdonald decl ¶  at that time ibm informed mr papermaster that acceptance of apples offer would violate the noncompetition agreement he had signed papermaster decl ¶  mr papermaster informed ibm that he needed time to consider the offer but he submitted his resignation the next day and his last day of employment was october   compl ¶  papermaster decl ¶  on october   without ibms knowledge mr papermaster signed an employment agreement with apple papermaster decl ex  mr papermaster also signed an intellectual property agreement which contained a provision acknowledging his agreement to not improperly use or disclose to apple any confidential or proprietary or secret information  of his former employers or any other person and not to bring any confidential proprietary or secret information of his former employers or any other persons onto apple property papermaster decl ex  at the preliminary injunction hearing mr papermasters counsel indicated that mr papermaster began his employment at apple on november   a fact which ibm was not aware of until the preliminary injunction hearing thus prompting ibm to request a temporary restraining order ii discussion a standard of review a preliminary injunction is an

trade secrets and other sensitive information and that there is a substantial risk of mr papermaster disclosing this information to ibms detriment further ibm argues that mr papermaster has already acknowledged that a breach of the noncompetition agreement would irreparably harm ibm see noncompetition agreement §  you acknowledge that the company would suffer irreparable harm if you fail to comply with the agreement and that the company would be entitled to any appropriate relief including  equitable relief emphasis added new york courts define a trade secret as any formula pattern

 fd   d cir  internal quotation marks omitted courts routinely have noted that it is very difficult to calculate the monetary damages that would successfully redress the loss associated with trade secret misappropriation estee lauder  f supp d at  see also fmc corp v taiwan tainan giant indus co  f d   d cir  it is clear that the loss of trade secrets cannot be measured in money damages natsource  f supp d at  noting that it is generally not possible to calculate monetary damages if an employee violates a noncompete clause citing ticor title ins co v cohen  fd   d cir  to determine whether information constitutes a trade secret the courts consider the following factors  the extent to which the information is known outside of the business  the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in the business  the extent of measures taken by the business to guard the secrecy of the information   the value of the information to the business and its competitors  the amount of effort or money expended by the business in developing the information  the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others n atl instruments  fd at  quoting ashland mgmt v janien  ned   ny  where a court finds that an employee is in possession of trade secret information the court must still determine whether that employee has actually misappropriated the information or whether the new employment creates a risk that disclosure of this information is inevitable payment alliance lnt l inc v ferreira  f supp d   sdny  here although there is no proof that defendant has actually misappropriated trade secrets particularly given that he was at apple for only five days before the injunction issued plaintiff argues that there is a substantial risk that he will do so in his new employment factors that guide a court in making the determination that disclosure of trade secrets is inevitable include  the extent to which the new employer is a direct competitor of the former employer  whether the employees new position is nearly identical to his old one such that he could not reasonably be expected to fulfill his new job responsibilities without utilizing the trade secrets of his former employer  the extent to which the trade secrets at issue would be valuable to the new employer and  the nature of the industry and its trade secrets payment alliance intl  f supp d at  internal quotation marks and citations omitted earth web inc v schlack  f supp d  sdny  same thus even where a trade secret has not yet been disclosed irreparable harm may be found based upon a finding that trade secrets will inevitably be disclosed where  the movant competes directly with the prospective employer and the transient employee possesses highly confidential or technical knowledge concerning  marketing strategies or the like estee lauder  f supp d at  internal quotation marks omitted and alterations in original in this analysis the existence of the noncompetition agreement is highly relevant see innoviant pharmacy inc v morganstern  f supp d   ndny  in cases such as this involving a person competing with his or her former employer particularly when such activity is prohibited by a restrictive covenant or is facilitated by the misappropriation of trade secrets or customer information courts have often taken a somewhat relaxed approach to the irreparable harm inquiry and in certain circumstances have found it appropriate to presume the existence of such an injury here mr papermaster is fully aware of many of ibms most sensitive trade secrets and he does not claim otherwise he worked for years with some of the crown jewels of ibms technology including its power architecture this welldeveloped blueprint which has been jealously guarded and promoted by ibm is used to design microprocessors for large ie servers and small ie cellphones and mp players devices and it gives ibm a leg up in the competitive world of electronics components moreover mr papermaster has been exposed to other sensitive and confidential information through his work as a member of the ivt and tlt group such as strategic plans product development technical recruitment and longterm business opportunities for ibm all of which is information that is disclosed to a select few within the company because mr papermaster has been inculcated with some of ibms most sensitive and closelyguarded technical and strategic secrets it is no great leap for the court to find that plaintiff has met its burden of showing a likelihood of irreparable harm to begin ibm has amply demonstrated that its business strategy continues to be the development of cuttingedge microprocessors that have application across the full spectrum of electronics products of course the court recognizes that ibm does not sell mp players or cellphones that compete with the ipod or the iphone but ibm does sell the microprocessor technology that provides the electronic brains for those products and competes for that business to profit from the manufacture and sales of such microprocessors ibm relies heavily on its power architecture and has employed mr papermaster as its top expert in the development and application of that technology it is conceded that mr papermaster has spent the last two years working on a product the blade server that competes directly with apples xserve and this alone establishes that ibm and apple directly compete mr papermaster however has not been hired by apple to work on the xserve thus it is no more helpful to ibms case that apple sells servers than it is to mr papermasters case when he says that he will not use his server knowledge in his new job at apple however mr papermaster has been given the title of senior vice president device hardware engineering and will work on the ipod and the iphone products that the court takes judicial notice are critical to apples financial success see eg press release apple reports fourth quarter results oct   httpwwwapplecomprlibraryl  resultshtml noting revenue growth related to ipod and iphone products and quoting mr jobs as stating apple just reported one of the best quarters in its history with a spectacular performance by the iphone   little has been said about the precise responsibilities that this title entails or what mr papermasters average day would look like but his counsel represented to the court at the preliminary injunction hearing that mr papermaster will be responsible for the pl of the ipod and iphone in other words mr papermaster has not been wooed to apple merely to head up sales and marketing or to run apples human resources department for example instead he has been hired specifically to help apple make these two critical products more profitable to do that it is obvious that mr papermaster will be responsible for improving these products that is to make sure that they store more information do it more quickly and use less power in doing so it cannot be disputed that ipods and iphones are powered by microprocessors and any improvement in the speed storage and power capabilities of those devices depends on improvements in microprocessor design ibms business includes the development of microprocessors for consumer electronics see suppl madsen decl ex   ibm form k at  noting ibms leadership position in the design of smaller faster and energyefficient semiconductor devices thus it is likely that mr papermaster inevitably will draw upon his experience and expertise in microprocessors and the power architecture which he gained from his many years at ibm and which apple found so impressive to make sure that the ipod and iphone are fitted with the best available microprocessor technology and at a lower cost indeed any claim that he would merely use general engineering skills is belied by apples focus on mr papermasters spot on knowledge of semiconductors and microprocessor design lambert decl  ex  yet by drawing upon ibmdeveloped proprietary information in these fields mr papermaster will harm in unquantifiable ways ibms ability to compete for the sale of products that could be used in the ipods and iphones of the future thus improperly placing mr papermaster in direct competition with his former employer see estee lauder  f supp d at  noting that irreparable harm may be established where there is a substantial risk that the defendant will disclose trade secret information global switching inc v kasper no cv  wl  at  edny june   finding irreparable harm where the plaintiff established that its former employee would be working in direct competition with it lumex inc v highsmith  f supp  edny  finding irreparable harm where employee was a member of the elite strategic planning committee and therefore privy to discussions involving marketing strategy and product lines two other facts make the likelihood of irreparable harm to ibm more than mere speculation first mr papermaster has acknowledged that ibm would suffer irreparable harm if he violated the noncompetition agreement noncompetition agreement§  the second for example ibm has developed new storage technology that allows ipods and other mp players to store more data at a lower cost suppl adkins decl ¶  ex  circuit has recognized that employment contracts which internally acknowledge such harm might arguably be viewed as an admission by the defendant that plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm were he to breach the contracts noncompete provision ticor title ins  fd at  accord estee lauder  f supp d at  while there is no authority indicating that such a contract provision entitles a plaintiff to a per se finding of irreparable harm intl creative mgmt  wl  at  the explicit provision in the agreement and common sense indicate that ibm will be irreparably harmed by the disclosure of the important technical and proprietary information that mr papermaster carries in his head global telesys inc v kpnqwest nv  f supp d  sdny  the second critical fact that underscores the likely threat to ibm from mr papermasters new job is apples purchase of pa semi a microchip company based in apples home state subsequent to its initial decision not to hire mr papermaster to run the ipodiphone division after apple purchased pa semi but before it hired mr papermaster to head up the ipodiphone division apple revealed that it was going to have pa semi do systemonchips for iphones and ipods adkins decl¶  in other words apple announced its intention to have pa semi develop the very type of product that ibm sells to the market generally and would like to sell to companies like apple several months thereafter apple for reasons that mr papermaster has not explained changed its mind about mr papermasters credentials and hired him to run the ipodiphone division the court accepts that mr papermaster will not be managing pa semi assets in his role at apple or developing the microprocessors that are used in ipod and phone products and that he will procure microprocessors from outside his group however mr papermaster will be responsible for improving and developing the ipod and iphone which necessarily will require him to make decisions about what type of microprocessor technology to use in these products and while he may procure such technology outside of his group his boss has suggested that the source for this technology while technically out of mr papermasters group could be pa semi an apple subsidiary that competes directly with ibm given that apple hired mr papermaster at least in part because of his chip expertise it no doubt expects him to use this specialized knowledge to determine the technical specifications for the electronic brains of the products he will oversee again it is inconceivable that mr papermaster will not draw upon his ibm experiences in making those decisions in suggesting that apples hiring of mr papermaster threatens ibm with irreparable injury the court does not mean to suggest that mr papermaster has intentionally acted dishonorably while his decision not to tell ibm on october   that he already had accepted apples offer or that he intended to start at apple on november   are both curious the court has no evidence before it that mr papermaster has disclosed any ibm trade secrets to date the harm to ibm however is more likely to derive from inadvertent disclosure of the ibm trade secrets that have defined mr papermasters long career putanother way what other base of technical knowhow could mr papermaster draw upon to perform his new and important job thus while the court ascribes no illwill to mr papermaster the court finds that the likely inevitability of even inadvertent disclosure is sufficient to establish a real risk of irreparable harm to ibm see payment alliance intl  f supp d at  even if the defendant acted with the best of intentions he might unintentionally transmit information gained through his former employer during his day to day contact with his new employer internal quotation marks omitted verizon commcns inc v pizzirani  f supp d   e d pa  examining noncompete agreement under new york law and finding that because the defendant was working for a direct competitor it would strain credulity beyond the breaking point that the defendant would not consciously or unconsciously share or draw on insights gained from his work at his prior employer lumex  f supp at  finding risk of inevitable disclosure where the defendant was going to work for a competitor and noting that the defendant could not eradicate the trade secrets and the confidential information from his mind bus intelligence servs inc v hudson  fsupp   sdny  where the defendant had extensive knowledge of the plaintiffs technology the court found disclosure to be likely if not inevitable and inadvertent if the defendant commenced employment with her new employer c likelihood of success on the merits the issue of whether a restrictive covenant not to compete is enforceable by way of an injunction depends in the first place upon whether the covenant is reasonable in time and geographic area ticor title ins  fd at  accord payment alliance int’l  f supp d at  it is well established under new york law that restrictive covenants in employment agreements are enforceable only to the extent that they satisfy the overriding requirement of reasonableness internal quotation marks omitted because of strong public policy militating against the sanctioning of a persons loss of the ability to earn a livelihood new york law subjects a noncompete covenant by an employee to an overriding limitation of reasonableness which hinges on the facts of each case ticor title ins  fd at  internal quotation marks omitted the court finds that the restriction in the noncompetition agreement is very limited in time and that the nature of ibms business requires that the restriction be unlimited in geographic scope see natsource llc  f supp d at  see also estee lauder  supp d at  upholding worldwide limitation johnson controls  f supp d at  finding oneyear duration of covenant not unreasonably long in addition to establishing his technical knowhow and expertise ibm has shown that mr papermaster as a member of the ivt and tlt has extensive knowledge concerning ibms strategic plans and business forecasts all of which are legitimately protected by the noncompetition agreement see lumex  f supp at  noting employers interest in enforcing noncompetition agreement when employee attended meetings of a strategic planning committee where marketing and other business plans were discussed as a result the court finds that plaintiff has established that the trade secrets that defendant has been exposed to during his long tenure at ibm are likely to remain competitively valuable to ibm and its competitors for more than a year see verizon commcns  f supp d at  noting that the durational reasonableness of a noncompete agreement is judged by the length of time for which the employers confidential business information will be competitively valuable if a covenant by an employee not to compete survives the reasonableness test then enforcement will be granted to the extent necessary i to prevent an employees solicitation or disclosure of trade secrets  to prevent an employees release of confidential information regarding the employers customers or  in those cases where the employees services to the employer arc deemed special or unique ticor title ins  fd at  accord global switching inc  wl  at  same thus new york law strikes a balance by permitting companies to protect their management from being lured to competitors only to the extent necessary to prevent the misuse of trade secrets estee lauder  f supp d at  the noncompetition agreement restricts mr papermaster from working for any business enterprise which includes any entity that engages in  competition with the business units or divisions of the company in which defendant worked at any time during the two  year period prior to the termination of his employment noncompetition agreement § a while mr papermaster technically is in violation of this provision based on his work in ibms blade development unit because apples xserve line competes with ibms blade servers this is not the heart of mr papermasters potential breach instead mr papermasters breach of the noncompetition agreement is due to the fact that apple is an entity that engages in competition with the systems and technology group at ibm as noted above this group which includes the blade development unit that mr papermaster worked in between october  and  and other units in which mr papermaster has worked develops and manufactures the microprocessors that ibm markets to apple and others competing with ibm for apples business and because of its acquisition of pa semi apple competes directly with the systems and technology group in the chip market thus the court finds that ibm is likely to succeed on the claim that mr papermasters employment with apple violates the noncompetition agreement the noncompetition agreement further prohibits mr papermaster from working for “any significant competitor for the reasons outlined above the court finds that apple is a significant competitor of ibm and because of mr papermasters expertise it is likely that enforcement of the noncompetition agreement is necessary to prevent his disclosure of trade secrets in particular ibm persuasively argues that mr papermasters knowledge of the ibm power architecture is unique and irreplaceable a fact that mr papermaster himself acknowledged in his noncompetition agreement noncompetition agreement§ la as a result ibm would be at a disadvantage were mr papermaster to use this information while at apple even if he were not directly involved in the development or design of microprocessors at apple see ticor title ins  fd at  holding that injunctive relief is available to enforce a covenant not to compete where the employees services are special unique or extraordinary  if the covenant is reasonable and even though competition does not involve disclosure of trade secrets  omitting internal quotations marks natsource  f supp d at  finding restriction necessary where employees skill was of a level that could not be duplicated easily and where employer would be greatly harmed if employee were allowed to compete against employer bus intelligence servs  f supp at  the defendant is not directly involved in the development or design of new programs but has information which could be useful in such an undertaking within a year her knowledge of these matters will be outdated and of little use prior to that time disclosure of the defendants knowledge to her new employer would harm the plaintiff and provide a competitive advantage to her employer for the foregoing reasons the court finds that the noncompetition agreement is reasonable in duration and geographic scope and it is necessary to prevent the disclosure of ibms trade secrets thus it is probable that ibm will prevail on the merits of its claims for specific performance of the noncompetition agreement d balance of hardships in the alternative ibm has established that there are sufficiently serious questions going to the merits of its claims and that the balance of hardships is decidedly tipped in its favor in new york courts view employment restrictive covenants with suspicion because enforcement of employee restrictive covenants may result in the loss of an individuals livelihood global switching inc  wl  at  natsource llc  f supp d at  noting that a court must weigh the need to protect the employers legitimate business interests against the employees concern regarding the possible loss of livelihood internal quotation marks omitted here the court recognizes that enforcement of the noncompetition agreement will work a hardship on mr papermaster indeed mr papermaster has indicated that the position at apple is a onceinalifetime opportunity for him as it will involve significantly more responsibility and higher compensation papermaster decl ¶  on the other hand at the hearing and in its moving papers ibm acknowledged that it did not lightly sue its former employee further the court recognizes that it is difficult if not impossible to calculate the monetary damages that would compensate ibm for the disclosure of the sensitive trade secrets at issue in this case given the difficulty of assessing how much of a competitive advantage such confidential information could provide to apple see estee lauder  f supp d at  ibms intellectual property is its most valuable asset and in this case mr papermaster is a top expert in one of ibms key areas of technical knowhow mr papermaster also has been given access to sensitive strategic information further the court notes that before it knew that mr papermaster already had accepted apples offer ibm offered to increase mr papermasters salary to stay employed at ibm or to pay him a years salary merely not to work for apple ibm also warned defendant that his acceptance of apples offer would constitute a violation of the noncompetition agreement see estee lauder  f supp d at  finding that the fact that estee lauder had contracted to pay the defendant his salary for the duration of the scope of the noncompete clause assuaged the hardship to him especially since he could still work in a noncompetitive position thus while the court accepts mr papermasters view that his offer from apple represented a onceinalifetime opportunity mr papermaster also must accept the obligations he undertook when he became a top executive at ibm accordingly the court finds that ibms need to protect its legitimate business interests substantially outweighs the harm resulting to mr papermaster from temporarily not working for apple and as a result the balance of hardship tips decidedly in ibms favor iii conclusion for the foregoing reasons ibm has established irreparable harm and serious questions going to the merits if not the likelihood of success on the merits and that the balance of hardships tips decidedly in its favor as a result the court grants ibms motion for a preliminarily injunction however the court recognizes that the best way to fairly ensure that both parties equities are protected is to have them determined finally as quickly as possible see fmc corp  fd at  as a result the court has ordered that an expedited discovery schedule be arranged and that the trial take place as soon as practicable after discovery is completed this schedule will be discussed at a conference on november   at  am because the parties both have expressed concern about publicly filing in their entirety the submissions related to the preliminary injunction the court will file this opinion under seal to ensure that no sensitive information is improperly disclosed however the parties are to advise the court by november   what if any redactions should be made before the court publicly files this opinion so ordered dated november   white plains new york

that designs and manufactures among other things microprocessors and servers id in addition to the systems and technology group ibms other major groups include a global technology services segment a global business services segment a software segment and a global financing segment adkins decl ¶   according to mr papermaster there are three common categories for microprocessor applications  microprocessors for business enterprise applications such as servers  microprocessors for personal computing and gaming and  those embedded in other machines such as automobiles telephones and appliances papermaster decl  further according to mr papermaster each of these three categories drives a different design with different capability power consumption and circuit techniques id mr papermaster acknowledges having worked in two of the three categories of microprocessors servers and personal computing id  prior to its acquisition by apple pa semi was a licensee of ibm adkins decl ¶  however after the apple acquisition ibm limited the license to prohibit pa semi from using ibms power architecture in new microprocessor lines id in any event there is evidence in the record demonstrating that mr papermasters knowledge of ibms microprocessor technology exceeds that of p a semi id  mr mansfield sent this email in response to an email from danielle lambert the vice president of human resources at apple in her email to mr mansfield ms lambert wrote that mr mansfield had mentioned that mr papermaster was spot on in systems and semiconductor understanding but that he may be off in other ways lambert decl ex   the precise date of apples first offer to mr papermaster is not clear but mr papermaster describes it as occurring several weeks after his february

texas and apple is located in california def mark d papermasters mem of law in opp to pls mot for prelim inj defs mem  n for purposes of this application for injunctive relief the court will apply new york law while recognizing that defendant claims the right to address this issue in the future  for example ibm has developed new storage technology that allows ipods and other mp players to store more data at a lower cost suppl adkins decl ¶  ex   this sequence of events undercuts mr papermasters claim that he was merely a plan b hire the theory proffered by defendant is that apple initially sought to hire during the supposed plan a phase of the search process an executive with consumer electronics experience this process began in october  and lasted for five months thereafter lambert decl ¶  only after this phase the court is told did apple go to plan band interview other candidates including mr papermaster with managerial and leadership skills necessary to lead the ipodiphone division id yet the evidence shows that in fact apple received favorable information about mr papermaster in early january  and interviewed him in february  after that interview however apple did not offer mr papermaster the position in the ipodiphone division and instead offered him a job in the personal computer area this despite his asserted lack of knowledge in consumer electronics mr papermaster has provided little information regarding plan b including any internal documents about why apple determined that mr papermaster was not suitable for the position in the ipodiphone division in february  but that he was in october   mr papermaster notes that he has signed an intellectual property agreement with apple that prevents him from disclosing to apple any confidential information he gained while working at ibm however mr papermaster made similar promises in the noncompetition agreement he signed with ibm and in any event his subsequent agreement with apple does not blunt the risk of his inevitable disclosure of ibms confidential information see estee lauder  f supp d at  noting that the defendants stipulation that he would not provide trade secrets did not remove the threat of irreparable injury to the plaintiff  because the court finds that plaintiff has met its burden of showing irreparable harm by establishing the likely risk of inevitable disclosure the court finds unpersuasive defendants argument that if ibm actually had been concerned over the risk that he would divulge trade secrets it would not have allowed him a twoweek transition at ibm during which time he could have saved files copied records and taken other steps to misappropriate ibms trade secrets ibm reacted the way it did to mr papermasters disclosure of the apple offer because it did not know until three days before his departure that he had in fact accepted apples offer on october   and had a start date of november   ibms reasonable efforts to persuade mr papermaster to remain with ibm hardly are grounds for concluding that there is no risk of inevitable disclosure of ibms trade secrets should mr papermaster work for apple  defendant requested the court to redact two words of the opinion by a letter dated november   that has been filed under seal plaintiff orally advised the court at the november   conference that it had no objection to the public filing of the entire opinion the court granted defendants request in an order dated november   and redacted the opinion accordingly resulting in this amended opinion close case information last

citations no   us dist case opinions motion for preliminary injunctive relief granted court membership judges sitting kenneth m karas keywords noncompete clause trade secret in  mark papermaster ibms vice president of the blade development unit became the subject of a notable trade secret misappropriation and noncompete clause case when he announced a plan to move to apple as senior vice president of devices hardware engineering on october   ibm filed a complaint against papermaster claiming breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets they sought a preliminary injunction to prevent papermaster from working at apple claiming his employment violated noncompetition agreement contents  restraining order  inevitable disclosure  enforceability of noncompetition agreement  settlement  see also  references restraining orderedit ibm did not learn until the first hearing that papermaster had already started working for apple and immediately filed for a restraining order to enjoin him from continuing to work judge kenneth karas of the united states district court in the southern district of new york heard the case and granted ibms request before releasing the public opinion judge karas ruled that ibm must pay a  bond to papermaster for any costs or damages that papermaster might incur meanwhile still unable to work at apple inevitable disclosureedit ibm claimed that because of the information papermaster had access to including trade secrets there was substantial risk or mr papermaster disclosing this information to ibms detriment which would result in irreparable harm they argued inevitable disclosure stating that because of papermasters position and responsibilities at apple it was inevitable for him to apply knowledge learned at ibm to his work at apple thus aiding a competitor and harming ibm papermaster claimed that he could recall only two inconsequential areas in which apple was and only temporarily in direct competition with ibm industry analysis disagreed and found apple and ibm to be direct competitors papermaster had signed the noncompetition agreement which clearly stated that any breach of the agreement would cause irreparable harm judge karas also found that because mr papermaster has been inculcated with some of ibms most sensitive and closelyguarded technical and strategic secrets it is no great leap for the court to find that plaintiff has met its burden of showing likelihood of irreparable harm this is also despite an employment agreement papermaster signed with apple which stated explicitly that he would not disclose trade secrets from prior employers karas writes that the court doesnt believe papermaster would act dishonorably but that he couldnt help but inadvertently share some information that could be considered a trade secret enforceability of noncompetition agreementedit the court also considered whether or not the noncompetition agreement itself was reasonable and therefore enforceable karas found that given ibms international business the geographic scope was necessary and the time restriction of one year was reasonable additionally because of the similarity of the position at apple to his work at ibm the agreement was needed to prevent incidental misappropriation of ibm trade secrets critics believe the opinion could have repercussions such as expanding inevitable disclosure doctrine to the detriment of anybody attempting to further their career in a particular field by moving to another company in the same industry in considering whether or not the noncompete clause caused undue hardship to papermaster the court weighed the agreement with ibm against the onceinalifetime opportunity of the svp position judge karas concluded that since intellectual property is ibms most valued asset the cost of trade secret disclosure to ibm outweighed the cost to papermaster in delaying the opportunity the case was set to go to trial settlementedit on  january  it was announced that papermasters lawsuit with ibm had been settled and that hed take over senior vice president of devices hardware engineering at apple on  april  replacing tony fadell who stepped down some months earlier the settlement requires that papermaster make two scheduled court certifications  the first having occurred on july  and another in october   to testify that he will protect ibm trade secrets see alsoedit

secrets a new byte of the “inevitable disclosure” apple by david j clark  peter l altieri on february   posted in inevitable disclosure a recent decision of the united states district court southern district of new york entitled international business machines corporation v papermaster no cv kmk  wl   us dist lexis  sdny nov   appears to have breathed new life into the “inevitable disclosure” doctrine apparently easing the burden of proof that an employer must satisfy in order to show the irreparable harm necessary for a court to grant an injunction preventing the former employee from working for a competitor under the inevitable disclosure doctrine certain employees cannot “wipe clean” their knowledge of their former employers’ trade secrets despite such employee’s best efforts to avoid disclosing any trade secrets to the new employer the employee will inevitably disclose trade secrets to the new employer simply by virtue of the employment and therefore should be enjoined from working for the new employer for some period of time even in the absence of any noncompete agreement the inevitable disclosure doctrine may provide a source of relief against improper competition by former employees even where the employer cannot show actual misuse or intent to misuse confidential or trade secret information pepsico inc v redmond  fd  th cir  the recent ibm v papermaster decision not only grants injunctive relief to ibm preventing papermaster’s employment with competitor apple inc without ibm presenting evidence of actual misappropriation but bases its finding of irreparable harm largely upon the probability of “inadvertent” disclosure by papermaster and papermaster’s acknowledgement in his employment agreement with ibm that ibm would suffer irreparable harm were he to breach the agreement’s noncompetition provision this seems a surprisingly low threshold for applying the inevitable disclosure doctrine to find irreparable harm in the absence of any evidence of misuse or even misappropriation of confidential information andor trade secrets mark d papermaster worked at ibm for  years in various product design and development roles and in  joined an elite group of about  top executives that develops ibm’s corporate strategy papermaster’s last day of employment with ibm was october   and he began working at apple on november   ibm sought a preliminary injunction and in its november   decision the district court enjoined papermaster from working for or with apple until further order of the court the court held that ibm faced irreparable harm even though there was no reason to ascribe illwill to papermaster or to doubt that he would abide by apple’s intellectual property agreement in which he agreed not to use or disclose to apple any confidential proprietary or secret information of his previous employers or otherwise to think that he would misuse or disclose ibm’s trade secrets the court’s holding that such disclosure was nonetheless inevitable rested in large part on its conclusion that inadvertent disclosure would probably occur on the boilerplate provision in papermaster’s ibm noncompetition agreement stating that he agreed that ibm would suffer “irreparable harm” if he worked for a competitor and on what the court termed “common sense” having relied on these factors which may not previously have been sufficient to find irreparable harm the papermaster decision could have the effect of further expanding the application of the inevitable disclosure doctrine the papermaster matter was set to go to trial in late february  but the parties reached a settlement by consent order on january   which will allow papermaster to begin working for apple on april   time will tell if other courts follow the

disclosure subscribe to inevitable disclosure inevitable disclosure a theory not a claim by peter l altieri on september   posted in inevitable disclosure in a recent decision from the southern district of new york judge william h pauley iii rejected the use of the “inevitable disclosure” doctrine as a basis for an independent claim and outright granted a rule  motion to dismiss the complaint brought by a california employer against its former new york based employee janus et cie v andrew kahnke  civ  whp us district court sdny august   is a case brought by janus a provider of highend residential and commercial furnishings against andrew kahnke a sales manager in one of its showrooms who was subject to a confidentiality agreement without any restrictive covenants when kahnke resigned and went to work for a direct competitor janus commenced an action for inevitable disclosure of trade secrets seeking a permanent injunction barring him from disclosing any of janus’ trade secrets or confidential information and from working for dedon his new employer in any area where they are direct competitors janus does not allege that kahnke breached the nondisclosure agreement nor does janus assert any facts indicating that kahnke actually misappropriated or disclosed any of janus’ trade secrets rather janus seeks an injunction based on the theory that “kahnke’ s position with dedon is so similar    that he cannot possibly perform the functions of his position    without using andor disclosing confidential information and trade secrets belonging to janus” compl ¶  the court wrote janus makes the extraordinary request that this court be the first to recognize the inevitable disclosure of trade secrets as a standalone claim in a complaint bereft of any allegations that kahnke misappropriated trade secrets or breached a noncompete agreement in essence janus asks this court to allow a lawsuit to proceed to discovery when the complaint alleges no wrongdoing by kahnke but the end game is a permanent injunction that would greatly expand the reaches of a restricted doctrine heavily disfavored under new york law after analyzing new york precedent the court acknowledged the possible validity of the doctrine of inevitable disclosure but rejected the notion that it constituted a standalone cause of action absent allegations of related unlawful conduct in granting the motion to dismiss the case the court refused “to countenance the imposition of an unlimited unbargainedfor restrictive covenant on mr kahnke based on thread bare allegations” when suing a former employee with sensitive confidential information this case stands for the proposition that you need more than mere inference of potential use or disclosure of such information to withstand a motion to dismiss some evidence of wrongdoing rising to level of an actual breach of contract misappropriation or other tortious conduct will be necessary to plead a sustainable cause of action federal court in chicago refuses to issue injunction based upon either an “inevitable disclosure” claim or a month noncompete with an “extremely broad” geographic scope by peter a steinmeyer on january   posted in inevitable disclosure noncompete agreements coauthored by viktoria lovei a federal judge in chicago recently refused to issue an injunction based upon either the “inevitable disclosure” of trade secrets doctrine or a geographically broad month noncompete that did not have a narrowly drawn activity restriction triumph packaging group v ward et al no cv nd ill dec   the case was brought by triumph a manufacturer of packaging for consumer goods suppliers it sought among other things to enjoin ward its former chief operating officer from assuming a position with agi a manufacturer of packaging primarily for the media and entertainment industries triumph argued among other things that ward’s employment with agi would require him to inevitably use or disclose triumph’s trade secrets in evaluating triumph’s claim under the illinois trade secrets act “itsa” the court found that triumph was reasonably likely to succeed in proving the existence of certain trade secrets however the court concluded that triumph was unlikely to succeed in establishing that the disclosure of such trade secrets by ward was inevitable because the evidence demonstrated that ward’s role at agi presented no reasonable danger of him using or disclosing triumph’s trade secrets specifically the court relied on its findings that  triumph and agi were neither “fierce” nor “even direct” competitors because they focused on the manufacture of different types of packaging for mostly different industries and do not currently share any customers  ward’s position at agi was dissimilar from his position at triumph in “a variety of ways”  “there is no evidence in the record that mr ward’s new position will require him to use or disclose triumph’s trade secrets and he testified credibly that he will not do so” and  triumph’s trade secrets were not applicable to agi’s business with respect to ward’s postemployment noncompete the court held that it was “extremely overbroad and likely unenforceable” first the court held that it was “extremely broad in geographical scope” because it prohibited ward “from working with any competitor ‘within any geographical area’ of where triumph or its subsidiaries engage in business or have plans to engage in business” additionally the court noted that “the qualifying term ‘within any geographical area’ is unclear and does not provide any degree of certainty as to where mr ward may work without violating the provision” second the court held that the “duration of the noncompete clause —  months by default and  months if mr ward breaches his obligations under the agreement during the prior  months – is very lengthy” the court agreed with ward that where “temporal and geographic restrictions on an employee’s conduct are broad    the agreement’s activity restrictions should be correspondingly narrowly drawn to protect the employee’s ability to be employed in his chosen field” because the court found that the noncompete was “significantly overbroad in several ways” it refused to modify or “bluepencil” it though not a path breaking decision this case is nevertheless a reminder about the narrowness of the inevitable disclosure doctrine and the need to draft noncompete clauses as tightly as possible to address a company’s legitimate needs eleventh circuit weighs in on florida noncompete law by epstein becker  green pc on august   posted in inevitable disclosure noncompete agreements florida law specifically section  florida statutes generally authorizes courts to enforce noncompete and other postemployment restrictive covenants provided the agreements are in writing and signed by the employees against whom enforcement is sought are reasonable in time area and line of business and are supported by one or more legitimate business interests supporting the restrictive covenants section  is fairly detailed the statute defines what a reasonable time period is it depends on the nature of the restrictive covenant it lists several legitimate business interests and it even addresses potential defenses for example it states that the court “shall not consider any individualized economic or other hardship that might be caused to the person against whom enforcement is sought” still section  leaves several issues unaddressed leaving the courts to sort them out several of those issues are addressed in a  page opinion issued recently by the eleventh circuit court of appeals in proudfoot consulting co v gordon th cir july   the eleventh circuit affirmed the district court’s injunction but reversed the  million damages award to the former employer here are some key points to take away from the court’s decision • where a noncompete covenant does not contain a geographic limitation the court can supply a reasonable geographic scope and where as here the employee had been assigned to a territory that included all of north american and europe this geographic area is reasonable • the court expressed doubt that a broad noncompete agreement that prohibits the former employee from working for a competitor irrespective of which clients he is serving would be reasonably necessary to protect an employer’s interest in the relationships that the former employee developed with its clients • the court also expressed doubt that such a broad noncompete agreement would be reasonably necessary to protect clientspecific confidential information if restrictions that prevent the employee from contacting or working for those clients would be sufficient to protect that information • on the other hand the court stated that where an employee has access to confidential business information crucial to the success of the employer’s business the employer has a strong interest in enforcing a covenant not to compete irrespective of whether the employee improperly retains and uses that information in his new employment but the court noted that it is unclear under florida case law precisely when confidential information will justify a broad noncompete covenant is it sufficient that the employee be in a position at his new employer to use the former employer’s confidential information or must the former employer meet the higher burden of proving that disclosure of the confidential information by the employee would be inevitable in the employee’s new position the court declined to answer this question finding that under the facts of this case where the employee had actually retained some of his former employer’s confidential business information the potential disclosure of that information to his new employer justified the enforcement of the noncompete covenant • it is not necessary that the former employer prove that the employee intentionally breached the restrictive covenants at issue in order to receive injunctive relief the employee’s good faith reasonable belief that he is not in breach of a restrictive covenant is no defense • with respect to damages the fact that the new employer profits from a breach of its employee’s noncompete agreement with his former employer is irrelevant absent a finding that the employee directly caused his former employer to lose profits “damages for breach of a noncompete are intended to make the prior employer whole not to punish employees” furthermore “disgorgement of profits earned is not a remedy for breach of contract” especially where the new employer is not even a party to the litigation adult nightclub seeks injunctive relief against former director for poaching high revenue clients and exotic dancers by kara m maciel on march   posted in inevitable disclosure noncompete agreements employers across all sectors of industry rely on narrowly tailored employment agreements to prevent employees from unfairly competing and stealing clients and customers postemployment last week the adult nightclub chain penthouse club filed a suit seeking a temporary restraining order and other injunctive relief against a former director for violating a noncompete and nondisclosure agreement penthouse claims that after the former director was fired for cause he became employed at a rival nightclub not far from the penthouse club such mere employment allegedly directly violated the terms of his noncompete agreement penthouse also alleges that he is now using his contacts and intimate knowledge of penthouse’s customers and employees to bring business to his new employer as a result of his highlevel position which included access to the club’s vip room where members pay a  fee to join and then a  fee each year the former director obtained extensive knowledge concerning the real names of members and exotic dancers who worked there penthouse is relying on the “inevitable disclosure” theory to assert that it would be inevitable that the former director would use his knowledge of clients and employees to his and his new employer’s competitive advantage the agreement that the former director signed in  contained restrictive covenants including a noncompete nondisclosure and nonsolicitation provisions penthouse is relying on the unique nature of its business and in particular the fact that its exotic dancers and entertainers specifically attract particular customers in order to establish its legitimate business interests and the competitive disadvantage that the former director’s solicitations could cause to penthouse penthouse attempted to resolve the dispute informally through a cease and desist letter but ultimately filed suit in federal court in illinois seeking an injunction and monetary damages in excess of    new york court holds that familiarity with software program without evidence of knowledge of program’s source codes or imminent commercial piracy does not support injunction seeking enforcement of restrictive covenants and protection of trade secrets by david j clark  peter l altieri on february   posted in inevitable disclosure trade secrets and confidential information in a decision dated january   in the matter epiq systems inc v hartie index no  the supreme court of the state of new york new york county by judicial hearing officer and retired justice ira gammerman denied a preliminary injunction in aid of arbitration sought by plaintiffs epiq systems inc and related companies collectively “epiq” epiq claimed that it faced inevitable disclosure of its trade secrets by three individual defendants formerly employed at epiq and their new employer kurtzman carson consultants llc “kcc” with respect to three computer programs including one webbased system developed and used by epiq to solicit ballots and tabulate ballot results in chapter  bankruptcy proceedings and in analogous foreign proceedings involving widelyheld public securities epiq sought to enforce restrictive covenants in its employment agreements which barred the individual defendants from disclosing epiq’s confidential proprietary or trade secret information competing against epiq or soliciting epiq’s customers for one year after termination and soliciting epiq’s employees during employment and for one year after termination after a twoday hearing in september  the court entered a temporary restraining order specifically limiting although not prohibiting the individuals’ employment with kcc although the court held that any arbitration award to which epiq might ultimately be entitled apparently would be rendered ineffectual absent preliminary relief it declined to issue a preliminary injunction against defendants finding that epiq had not satisfied any of the elements of the traditional tripartite test for injunctive relief likelihood of success on the merits showing of irreparable harm and balance of equities favoring the movant key findings for the court were that the individual defendants did not know any part of the source code or the underlying algorithms of epiq’s programs even though they had worked at length with epiq’s programmers and so they could not disclose such information to kcc in addition kcc already had its own software program that allowed kcc to perform bankruptcyrelated solicitation and tabulating projects inhouse moreover the court held that even if the defendants would seek to improve kcc’s software their knowledge brought to bear on such a project would not constitute a trade secret under the definition of trade secret under section  comment b of the restatement of torts which applies under new york law in finding a lack of irreparable harm the court also noted that it had been presented with no real evidence that defendants had committed or were about to commit commercial piracy epiq filed a notice of appeal on february   a new byte of the “inevitable disclosure” apple by david j clark  peter l altieri on february   posted in inevitable disclosure a recent decision of the united states district court southern district of new york entitled international business machines corporation v papermaster no cv kmk  wl   us dist lexis  sdny nov   appears to have breathed new life into the “inevitable disclosure” doctrine apparently easing the burden of proof that an employer must satisfy in order to show the irreparable harm necessary for a court to grant an injunction preventing the former employee from working for a competitor under the inevitable disclosure doctrine certain employees cannot “wipe clean” their knowledge of their former employers’ trade secrets despite such employee’s best efforts to avoid disclosing any trade secrets to the new employer the employee will inevitably disclose trade secrets to the new employer simply by virtue of the employment and therefore should be enjoined from working for the new employer for some period of time even in the absence of any noncompete agreement the inevitable disclosure doctrine may provide a source of relief against improper competition by former employees even where the employer cannot show actual misuse or intent to misuse confidential or trade secret information pepsico inc v redmond  fd  th cir  the recent ibm v papermaster decision not only grants injunctive relief to ibm preventing papermaster’s employment with competitor apple inc without ibm presenting evidence of actual misappropriation but bases its finding of irreparable harm largely upon the probability of “inadvertent” disclosure by papermaster and papermaster’s acknowledgement in his employment agreement with ibm that ibm would suffer irreparable harm were he to breach the agreement’s noncompetition provision this seems a surprisingly low threshold for applying the inevitable disclosure doctrine to find irreparable harm in the absence of any evidence of misuse or even misappropriation of confidential information andor trade secrets mark d papermaster worked at ibm for  years in various product design and development roles and in  joined an elite group of about  top executives that develops ibm’s corporate strategy papermaster’s last day of employment with ibm was october   and he began working at apple on november   ibm sought a preliminary injunction and in its november   decision the district court enjoined papermaster from working for or with apple until further order of the court the court held that ibm faced irreparable harm even though there was no reason to ascribe illwill to papermaster or to doubt that he would abide by apple’s intellectual property agreement in which he agreed not to use or disclose to apple any confidential proprietary or secret information of his previous employers or otherwise to think that he would misuse or disclose ibm’s trade secrets the court’s holding that such disclosure was nonetheless inevitable rested in large part on its conclusion that inadvertent disclosure would probably occur on the boilerplate provision in papermaster’s ibm noncompetition agreement stating that he agreed that ibm would suffer “irreparable harm” if he worked for a competitor and on what the court termed “common sense” having relied on these factors which may not previously have been sufficient to find irreparable harm the papermaster decision could have the effect of further expanding the application of the inevitable disclosure doctrine the papermaster matter was set to go to trial in late february  but the parties reached a settlement by consent order on january   which will allow papermaster to begin working for apple on april   time will tell if other courts follow the lead of the papermaster decision in applying the inevitable disclosure
