the opportunity to make an impact through the power of their investments in a way no other socially responsible and sustainable mutual fund family can    investing in sustainable companies  leading shareholder advocacy program  supporting environmental and public health nonprofits  sustainable investment strategy for  years green century has helped individuals and institutions invest for their future without compromising their values green century believes that environmentally responsible investing also offers potential financial benefits and there is a growing body of evidence that demonstrates that investing with environmental social and governance esg performance may offer financial advantages for example we believe that when companies avoid harming the environment communities in which they operate and public health they may not only enjoy a competitive advantage by appealing to consumers concerned about sustainability but also may avoid damage to their brand reputations and costly litigation green century offers three mutual funds the green century msci international index fund invests in the stocks of foreign companies selected for their outstanding environmental social and governance performance the green century equity fund invests in the stocks of the companies included in the longestrunning socially responsible index customized to exclude any fossil fuel companies in the index the green century balanced fund invests in the stocks and bonds of environmentally responsible companies as well as green bonds which finance climate mitigation projects worldwide sri and valuesbased exclusions fossil fuel companies – coal oil and gas nuclear power companies military weapons and civilian firearm companies producers of genetically modified organisms gmos tobacco companies examples of sustainable companies with outstanding esg ratings energy efficiency renewables water treatment  conservation air pollution control sustainable infrastructure and transportation companies that disclose policies and performance on critical environmental impacts sustainable agriculture companies including organic and natural food suppliers companies that apply sustainability criteria throughout the supply chain green century uses valuesbased or socially responsible and impact sri investing screens to avoid the most environmentally and socially dangerous industries this aligns investments with the values of our investors and also offers potential financial benefits such as avoiding stranded assets that may be associated with investing in coal oil and gas companies green century also employs environmental social and governance ratings and performance to only select those companies that perform better across these categories as compared to companies in the same sector while some other investments may just use one or the other or the above methodologies green century uses both to deliver high impact investments fossil fuel free investing green century is the first family of responsible and diversified fossil fuel free mutual funds in the us our fossil fuel free commitment exceeds the global divestment baseline of avoiding the largest  fossil fuel companies as ranked by potential carbon emissions content of their reported reserves green century goes beyond this initial list since we have found that when investors decide to eliminate dirty energy from their portfolios for ethical andor financial reasons they more often want to eliminate them from their portfolios entirely our definition of fossil fuel free investing excludes companies that explore for extract process and refine and transmit coal oil and gas as well as companies that burn fossil fuels to make electricity or any companies with carbon reserves as more investments are described as environmental or fossil fuel free we believe it is important to keep these distinctions in mind “low carbon” is not the same as fossil fuel free it might be but it also might apply to carbon emissions and carbon reserves or it might just apply to the overall carbon footprint of an investment  since there is no standardized characterization of the term you should review the prospectus see below for exclusions and also look in the energy and utility sector holdings section of a fund note that “energy sector” may roughly translate to “fossil fuel companies” and holdings noted in the “utility sector” may be fossil fuel burning utilities or may be likely to be involved in fossil fuel extraction and consumption review the prospectus marketing terms are not the same as investment strategies and binding exclusion such as avoiding fossil fuel companies and should be spelled out in the prospectus the prospectus is a legal document that should always be available to a prospective investor that contains a fund’s objectives investment strategies risks as well as other details without a clear statement addressing what fossil fuel free means in the prospectus an investor cannot be sure what the fund may or may not invest in green century details our definition of fossil fuel companies and avoidance of these companies in our prospectus you can review the prospectus of the green century funds by clicking here our commitment to fossil fuel free investing is one way we help our investors avoid the very companies and industries at the heart of many environmental and social issues as well as potential financial risks associated with oil price volatility and stranded assets httpgreencenturystagingwpenginecomwpcontentuploadspdfvideomp     what about performance there are growing concerns about investing in coal oil and gas including the volatility of oil prices capital expenditures on highcost projects such as offshore and arctic drilling and the potential of devalued or stranded carbon reserve assets fossil fuel divestment at green century these concerns are just some of the reasons green century has a longstanding investment
