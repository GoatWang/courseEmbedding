products forum norm champ director division of investment management new york ny oct   introduction good morning everyone and thank you tracy for that kind introduction and for inviting me to speak here today before i begin let me remind you that the views i express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the commission any of the commissioners or any other colleague on the staff of the commission i was glad to be asked to speak at this forum because i believe the purpose of this forum—to discuss the issues challenges and opportunities related to complex products—is extremely relevant in today’s environment this group in particular represents companies who are frequently at the forefront of innovation in the asset management industry before joining the sec in  i worked in and around the private fund industry for more than fifteen years and i experienced firsthand the tremendous amount of work that goes into creating evolving investment products and strategies i continue to believe that innovative products can help meet the everevolving demands of investors and the division has become increasingly focused on how we as regulators can effectively monitor the risks associated with such products the division of investment management’s mandate in this landscape is clear—our mission is to protect investors promote informed investment decisions and facilitate appropriate innovation in investment management products and services the division’s staff possesses a deep understanding and mastery of the more traditional work of the division and has increasing expertise in specialized financial services and complex products i work with almost  smart highly motivated people who are committed to carrying out the division’s critical mission in an economy that is constantly growing innovating and changing today i would like to discuss the division’s enhanced risk monitoring efforts in the asset management industry and then discuss alternative mutual funds one area where we have seen significant growth recently enhanced risk monitoring efforts the commission continues to be very focused on risk monitoring and data gathering especially as products and markets become more complex and as the risks facing the industry evolve to that end we have enhanced the division’s ability to monitor and better understand the investment management industry—both by launching new initiatives to monitor risk and by sharpening the existing tools at our disposal we gather and analyze data and monitor risk through a number of avenues including but not limited to  the routine review of requests for noaction and exemptive relief and disclosure filings  our senior level engagement program  our industry monitoring program  our expert staff and  coordination with other offices in the commission our data gathering and risk monitoring efforts are an integral part of the entire division’s work and together contribute to our ability to make better and more informed policy recommendations to the commission and put out guidance to our stakeholders review of requests for noaction and exemptive relief and disclosure filings the division’s role of reviewing requests for noaction and exemptive relief and disclosure filings is one way that we monitor new trends and their associated risks we view the exemptive application process as the laboratory where we examine new ideas from market participants as you may know it was through the exemptive relief process that money market funds and exchangetraded funds etfs started reviewing requests for noaction and exemptive relief provide the staff with an opportunity to consider the benefits of new products but also anticipate the potential risks to investors and to the market over the last few months we evaluated the potential risks associated with a proposed nontransparent etf structure last week the commission issued two notices indicating the commission’s intention to deny two applications for exemptive relief to launch such etfs the division’s role of reviewing disclosure and fund financial reporting also affords the staff a unique position to identify and monitor industrywide risks for example last year our disclosure review staff noticed an increase in the number of funds using the word “protected” in their fund names the staff raised concerns that when a fund’s name suggests safety or protection from loss an investor may misunderstand the risks associated with an investment in the fund to clarify the staff’s position on the use of words like “protected” in a fund’s name the staff issued a guidance update in november  articulating the staff’s concerns this is an excellent example of how the division’s data gathering and trends monitoring helps us to think about areas where we as regulators can protect investors and provide further guidance to our stakeholders we aim to clarify the staff’s views by issuing im guidance updates we see guidance updates as meaningful communications representing the staff’s thinking on discrete issues not as substitutes for the established rulemaking exemptive application and noaction processes in a former life i served as a general counsel and chief compliance officer and advised on investment management regulatory matters in both the inhouse and outside counsel roles in those roles i found that guidance from the commission and its staff was extremely beneficial in making the right calls and promoting a culture of compliance i appreciate that interpretive ambiguity can have a dampening effect on pursuing innovative ideas we see the guidance update process as another avenue to remove uncertainty and improve the public’s understanding of the staff’s view on critical issues i believe these goals are particularly relevant as new and existing products become increasingly complex senior level engagement program one way that we have enhanced our risk monitoring efforts is through our senior level engagement program through this outreach initiative senior leadership of the division has met and continues to meet with senior management and fund boards at several of the country’s large asset managers to ensure that we meet with a representative sample of different firms we consulted with the office of compliance inspections and examinations or ocie and used a quantitative and qualitative approach to select a diverse cross section of firms based on their size activity mix product mix and geography i believe these meetings are extremely useful in promoting twoway communication between the industry and the commission staff we hope that by meeting with fund boards and executives in a nonexamination setting we can talk openly about potential issues before they arise we also believe this senior level engagement program will help us to better understand the workings of the industry we regulate these engagements give the division a “finger on the pulse” of registrants which has proved invaluable when an issue arises in the industry in these discussions we have learned a great deal about the identification and management of risk—risks specific to particular firms or funds as well as critical risks facing the industry as a whole these meetings allow us to obtain a focused and informed view of the systems controls and personnel of an individual firm communicating with the industry in these meetings and more broadly also results in better policy recommendations and helps us to identify division policies that could benefit from greater clarification—many of the topics for our im guidance updates arise from questions or comments that we receive directly from industry participants and we encourage stakeholders to contact the staff with their questions or comments industry monitoring program the division also conducts ongoing quantitative and qualitative financial analysis of the investment management industry—with a particular focus on strategically important investment advisers and funds—through our industry monitoring program our analysis of the data that the commission gathers enhances the division’s ability to protect investors for instance after fixed income markets experienced increased volatility in june  we examined developing trends in the fixed income market and released an im guidance update on risk management in changing fixed income market conditions the guidance update suggested certain steps for fund advisers to consider with respect to risk management and disclosure matters relating to changing market conditions also in  an ongoing analysis of money market fund data led to an enforcement action against ambassador capital management  during our review of the gross yield of funds as a marker of risk we identified the ambassador money market fund as consistently different from the rest of the market we brought this to the attention of ocie the matter was referred to the enforcement division’s asset management unit for further investigation and then the commission brought fraud charges against the advisory firm and portfolio manager the division has also been proactive in monitoring events—such as geopolitical natural disaster and market events—that may impact funds and advisers when such events occur we have focused on maintaining communication with affected asset managers and funds reviewing disclosures to investors and assessing the impact on investors’ ability to access funds or trade securities furthermore the division’s risk and examination office or reo in addition to participating in the senior level engagement program has the ability to conduct its own targeted exams of investment advisers and fund complexes reo generally also coordinates with ocie to gather information for policy issues during ocie’s regular examinations of firms we learn a great deal about firms from the examination process and what we learn helps to inform our policy recommendations expert staff many of our enhanced risk monitoring efforts would not have been possible without our expert staff the division’s staff has always had an unparalleled depth and breadth of knowledge and understanding of the traditional work of the division and has always used these tools to help the division fulfill its mission over the past few years we have added to our expertise by hiring quantitative experts industry experts examiners lawyers and accountants and i continue to be impressed by the level of expertise and dedication that these individuals have brought to the division earlier this month i was in a meeting about our data gathering project where we are considering recommending that the commission propose substantial improvements to the forms the commission uses to gather data from mutual funds we had a group of former portfolio managers phd economists quantitative analysts lawyers accountants and industry experts in derivatives and etfs all gathered together in one room when the group began debating risk measures it occurred to me how extremely fortunate we are to have hired such intelligent people dedicated to protecting our country’s investors i also realized that only five years ago when i joined the commission many of these experts were not at the commission it struck me how this wealth and diversity of knowledge and expertise makes our policy recommendations that much more informed and nuanced in addition to our data gathering project all of our risk monitoring efforts are helping us make better and more informed recommendations with respect to other potential policy matters for example as many of you know the commission issued a concept release in  on mutual funds’ use of derivatives our risk monitoring efforts are augmenting our continued study of the comments we received and are helping shape the potential policies we are considering in this area further among the initiatives we are considering are expanded stress testing of the largest asset management firms i believe that our enhanced risk monitoring efforts serve as one of the division’s most important modern tools to develop effective policies needed to address risks coordination with other offices in the commission the focus on risk monitoring and riskbased analytics is not limited to the division of investment management the commission as a whole has been focused on ways to better utilize the data it obtains through its monitoring efforts for example the staff now has access to a powerful new analytical tool called midas market information data analytics system which collects about  billion daily records from the proprietary feeds of each of the  national equity exchanges timestamped to the microsecond in addition to midas the quantitative analytics unit in the commission’s national exam program has also developed groundbreaking new technology that allows examiners to access and systematically analyze massive amounts of trading data from firms in a fraction of the time it would have taken in years past and i believe that these new analytical and riskmonitoring tools will continue to improve the commission’s ability to protect investors alternative mutual funds one of the trends that the division identified through our ongoing analysis of industry data and our review of disclosure filings is the rapid and significant growth in alternative mutual funds as of the end of september  alternative mutual funds had over  billion in assets although alternative mutual funds only accounted for  of the mutual fund market as of december  the inflows into these funds in  represented  of the inflows for the entire mutual fund industry with almost  billion of inflows into alternative mutual funds in  that is over five times more than the amount of inflows into alternative mutual funds in  i previously discussed alternative mutual funds on two recent occasions in june i outlined the heightened risks faced by alternative mutual funds with respect to valuation liquidity and leverage and the role that fund boards play in the oversight and compliance programs of alternative mutual funds in september i focused my remarks on the importance of a focus on compliance and the interests of investors for advisers launching alternative mutual funds today i would like to concentrate on the challenges of appropriately disclosing the heightened risks of alternative mutual funds to retail investors my colleague andrew bowden the director of ocie has compared alternative mutual funds to bright shiny objects—bright shiny objects that are sharp many investors have benefitted from including alternative mutual funds in their portfolios as they provide retail investors access to investment strategies that were previously only accessible to investors in private funds alternative mutual funds generally pursue strategies that seek to produce positive riskadjusted returns or alphas that are not closely correlated to traditional investments or benchmarks investors may also be attracted to alternative mutual funds because of the very characteristics that differentiate these registered funds from their private fund counterparts for example in comparison to private funds mutual funds may provide greater investment liquidity greater portfolio transparency lower advisory fees lower investor minimum requirements and no minimum eligibility requirements however i believe that several areas—such as valuation liquidity and leverage—present heightened risks for mutual funds when they pursue alternative investment strategies these heightened risks and the complex nature of the investment strategies employed by alternative mutual funds can make the goal of clear concise disclosure more difficult to attain the prospectus disclosure requirements of form na are intended to elicit information for an average or typical investor who may not be sophisticated in legal or financial matters but as fund strategies become more complex ensuring that the average investor has the information he or she needs to make informed investment decisions becomes more challenging to muddy the waters further the staff has raised concerns that there could be a disconnect between the strategies and risks that a fund discloses in its prospectus versus the strategies that the fund actually employs obviously such a disconnect would make it even more difficult for investors to determine whether a product is a suitable investment for them the division recognizes the challenges that funds face in writing clear concise disclosure about complex products and we have provided guidance on how the division views disclosure relevant to funds that engage in alternative investment strategies and invest in alternative assets in july  the division’s disclosure review and accounting office provided some observations about the thencurrent derivativesrelated disclosures by investment companies in registration statements and shareholder reports we reemphasized the importance of clear concise disclosure and described our expectations in our august  guidance update discussing “disclosure and compliance matters for investment company registrants that invest in commodity interests” the staff generally believes that all funds that use or intend to use alternative investment strategies should assess the accuracy and completeness of their disclosure including whether the disclosure is presented in an understandable manner using plain english disclosure of principal investment strategies should be tailored specifically to how a fund expects to be managed and should address those strategies that the fund expects to be the most important means of achieving its objectives and that it anticipates will have a significant effect on its performance in determining the appropriate disclosure a fund generally should consider the degree of economic exposure the alternative investment strategy creates in addition to the amount invested in that strategyfor instance staff believes that a small investment in some derivatives does not necessarily correlate with little effect on a funds performance because of the impact of leverage on the other hand staff has observed that a fund may have significant exposure to derivatives but that exposure may not make the fund substantially riskier the staff also generally believes that the risk disclosure in the prospectus for each fund should provide an investor a complete risk profile of the fund’s investments taken as a whole rather than a list of various investment strategies and reflect anticipated alternative investment or asset usage we note that investment strategies that employ derivatives including commodity interests may introduce risks in addition to those associated with investments in the cash markets and that we expect funds that use such strategies to address those risks in their disclosures where the information is material to investors an alternative mutual fund should for example disclose material risks relating to volatility leverage liquidity and counterparty creditworthiness that are associated with trading and investments in alternative investment strategies such as derivatives that are engaged in or expected to be engaged in by the fund finally the staff generally believes that a fund should assess on an ongoing basis the completeness and accuracy of alternative investmentsrelated disclosures in its registration statement in light of its actual operations the division’s staff has been reviewing data to compare the actual use of alternative investment strategies with what has been disclosed in fund disclosure documents based on these reviews the staff believes that a fund generally should assess based upon its actual operations whether it is meeting the requirements to completely and accurately disclose its anticipated principal investment strategies and risks a fund generally should review its use of alternative investment strategies when it updates its registration statement annually and assess whether it needs to review the disclosures in its registration statement that describes its principal alternative investment strategies and risks a fund should also generally consider the accuracy and completeness of marketing materials related to its investment objectives and performance as i have highlighted above alternative mutual funds face significant challenges when it comes to writing clear concise prospectus disclosure i cannot emphasize enough the importance of ensuring that retail investors have the information they need to make informed investment decisions especially with respect to alternative mutual funds and other complex products conclusion thank you for your attention i encourage you to keep up our dialogue please continue to approach me and the staff with your thoughts for areas where our guidance may be helpful and continue to develop the innovative ideas that will meet the new challenges faced by investors in the twenty first century  i would like to thank stephanie hui for providing vital assistance in preparing these remarks  the securities and exchange commission
