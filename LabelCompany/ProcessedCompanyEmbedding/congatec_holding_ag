automation medical entertainment transportation and test and measurement as a technology pioneer in our industry we have grown to become the market share leader in europe for the computeronmodule or com segment of the embedded computing market according to our view of the market and thirdparty research our deep technical expertise combined with longstanding customer processor partner and supplier relationships positions us as a trusted provider for industry standard and custom embedded computing solutions our participation in the design development and bringing to market of innovative embedded computing solutions has established what we believe is a track record of innovation by integrating complex central processing units or processors into flexible highperformance computer modules that

technology highquality products differentiated technical support a comprehensive partner network and financial strength the global merchant or outsourced embedded computing market is large and growing the internet of things or iot is enabling the next generation of computing whereby objects or endpoints interact with each other and their environment iot combines hardware such as processors sensors actuators and wireless transmitters with software optimized for big data analytics and realtime decision making industry  which refers to the emerging smart factory trend in europe builds on the foundation of iot to drive the rise of new digital industrial technology that connects sensors machines equipment and it systems along the value chain beyond a single enterprise these connected systems can interact with one another using standard internetbased protocols and will enable data to be gathered and analyzed across machines creating faster more flexible and more efficient processes to produce more reliable higher quality goods at reduced costs our embedded computing solutions help to facilitate both iot and industry  our end markets demand for iot capabilities has created numerous opportunities for us built upon key themes such as big data continuous connectivity and robust computing capabilities which are all delivered in increasingly compact form factors as the semiconductor industry continues to test the limits of moores law which suggests that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every  to  months processor technology will continue to grow in complexity creating challenges for systems engineers outside of traditional computing applications to implement and unlock the potential of such processors harnessing the power of these advanced processors is critical to the emergence of iot and industry  we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on these immediate and sustainable trends impacting the embedded computing industry we have longstanding relationships with the worlds leading processor companies including amd freescale and intel which allow us to provide a broad suite of embedded computing solutions to our growing customer base as a testament to our success intel has advised us that we are one of its largest european embedded computing partners and the first such partner

access to the technical specifications and capabilities of new processors which better allows us to integrate the latest processor technology into our embedded computing solutions resulting in improved performance cost savings time to market advantages and greater process simplicity for our customers in return these processor companies benefit from our integration of their processors into our customers end products while minimizing their direct engineering sales and aftermarket support needs our customers applications fall outside of the processor vendors core computing market and require more significant engineering and software and sales support due to the nature of the applications served this has created a challenge for our processor partners who recognize the growth potential of these market segments but are often not or ganized to efficiently pursue them we have seized the opportunity to address this gap in the market we extend the reach of our processor partners into emerging growth opportunities they are not positioned to support without us we enable our customers to outsource critical physical design and programming challenges for their products
