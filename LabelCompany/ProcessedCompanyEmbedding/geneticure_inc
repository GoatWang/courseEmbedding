that are involved in the regulation of renal na⁺ handling vasodilation and cardiac function all of these genes have repeatedly demonstrated physiologic effects in cell animal and human models and have also demonstrated altered pharmacogenetic effects based on current therapeutic guidelines and our current understanding of genetics and the proteins involved in blood pressure regulation we provide the critical information necessary for accurate therapeutic decision making in hypertension treating hypertension has never been easier i need more detail why use the geneticure high blood pressure pharmacogenetics panel ok great we like detail too the development of high blood pressure in humans is the result of one or more of three physiologic maladaptations elevated cardiac output liters of blood ejected from the heart per minute that increases the amount of blood pressing against the vessels increased sodium na⁺ absorption in the kidney which results in increased blood volume and subsequently increased outward pressure against the tubes vessels relatively narrow blood vessels that results in increased pressure towards the lumen of the blood vessel due to poiseuille’s law which describes the inverse relationship between the diameter of a tube vessel and the pressure against the walls of the tube vessel all else being equal as such common therapies for reducing blood pressure include those that inhibit na⁺ reabsorption in the kidney cause vasodilation or reduce cardiac output despite a significant impulse in the medical community to move towards an “individualized medicine” approach to patient centered treatment the current clinical treatment strategy for high blood pressure like other diseases is based on a set algorithm which does not take into account individual genetic differences of the patient rather physicians are guided to choose a drug one out of many options in a given class of drugs and use that specific drug as a “first line therapy” typically initiating with the diuretic class and titrate that specific drug of choice to therapeutic dosage it is only after a prolonged course of treatment with that specific class of drug that clinical efficacy is determined typically three months at this stage if clinical guideline goals for blood pressure have not been met it is often recommended that the patient remain on the “first line therapy” whilst an additional drug from a different class of drugs typically an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ace inhibitor or angiotensin ii receptor blocker arb is added to the pharmacologic regimen again this drug is titrated to recommended therapeutic dosage and another prolonged course of treatment is initiated before clinical efficacy is determined an additional three months – six months since initiation of treatment if at this point clinical guideline goals for blood pressure have not been met a third drug from a third class of drugs typically a betablocker is added and the process is repeated another three months – nine months from initiation of treatment further if clinical guideline goals have continued to be elusive the diagnosis of refractory hypertension is added and the process is reinitiated with a different combination of drugs different classes of drugs different drug options within a given class of drugs different dosages or all of the above thus from the time of initial diagnosis and the start of treatment to the point in which blood pressure is adequately controlled may take anywhere from three months to well over one year this trialanderror standard of care is clearly not optimal the geneticure solution is a superior method with higher quality patient care and meaningful reductions in time money and risk why geneticure

to  and prior to that in leadership roles at mayo medical ventures david’s vast and pertinent experience in the development and commercialization of laboratory developed tests should prove to be a major asset to geneticure as it builds out its pipeline of pharmacogenomics products “we couldn’t be more excited and honored that david chose to join our team” said scott snyder cofounderceo of geneticure of geneticure “his insights from his work at mayo clinic are going to help us tremendously as we grow and build a new category of medicine” david herbert echoes the excitement i really like the geneticure team and the practical evidencebased approach theyve taken to developing a solution to better manage hypertension” geneticure is demonstrating how personalized medicine can improve patient care with tools physicians can use now to better dial in the right hypertension drug for each patient from amongst all the treatment options rather than using the trial and error onesizefitsall approach that is the reason typical hypertension control takes  months on average herbert added in addition geneticure has brought on mark byrne founding ceo of assurex health a company
