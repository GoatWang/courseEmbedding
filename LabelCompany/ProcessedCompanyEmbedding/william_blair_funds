the delta for growth in environmental social and governance esg factor integration or sustainable investment adoption will continue to be more a function of the environmental and social trends that are reshaping industries and business models changing consumer preferences disruptive technologies and the shifting regulatory environment have presented companies with a mix of risk and return opportunities across a number of industries for example based on its analysis of global sector exposures to sustainability issues ubs in its april  global esg analyzer highlighted the energy and transportationrelated sectors as being most exposed to esg risks these risks are primarily related to co regulations new forms of mobility and innovative technologies certainly many companies in these industries are adapting to these risks to neutralize the effects on revenues but profitability and return on capital are under threat at the other end of the spectrum consumerrelated industries are considered to be more favorably exposed to esg issues as sustainability trends such as organic products and health awareness are net positives longerterm thematicoriented return opportunities are emerging across a wide range of industries while risk mitigation remains a key objective of sustainable investing longerterm thematicoriented return opportunities are emerging across a wide range of industries these themes are broadly tied to shifting demographics climate change resource scarcity and improvements in quality of life—particularly in developing economies the financials technology and telecom sectors are not traditional areas of focus for investors pursuing esg objectives but the growth of digital finance where these sectors intersect is proving to be a compelling sustainable investment theme the proliferation of mobile devices and rising demand for banking services among lowerincome populations have facilitated the creation of innovative payment platforms with high levels of adoption among the “underbanked” demographic this is particularly important in emerging markets where most people and small businesses transact exclusively in cash and do not participate in the formal financial system according to a recent study by the mckinsey global institute nearly  of adults in emerging markets own a mobile phone but only  have a financial account mckinsey estimates that  billion people out of  billion without bank accounts—more than half of whom are women— could be assimilated into the system via digital finance the graphic below shows how digital finance is affecting emerging markets the ability to accept wages subsidy payments and remittances or initiate tuition medical and rent payments from the palm of the hand is both convenient and empowering from a macroeconomic perspective rising loan demand and deposit growth are favorable outcomes of the migration to digital economic gains can potentially be achieved through productivity gains and lower costs from reducing cash transactions and brickandmortar branches among developing economies mckinsey sees the most potential for lowincome countries in africa and in india where digital finance could increase gross domestic product gdp growth by  to  although less significant the estimated  to  estimated growth benefits for middleincome countries such as china and brazil are also compelling esg

delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk
