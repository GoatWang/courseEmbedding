initially used as a running joke of the series as peter parkers aunt may repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her parker also known as spiderman consistently worms his way out of meeting mary jane who aside from a brief appearance in  june  with her face obscured is never actually seen until the amazing spiderman  november  peter david wrote in  that artist john romita sr made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant that blocked the readers view of her face in issue  and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used annmargret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her formfitting short skirts according to cocreator stan lee he and romita had intended for gwen stacy to be spidermans one true love and introduced mary jane just for fun but that somehow mary jane seemed to have all the personality and much as we tried to make gwen more attractive we couldnt we ourselves felt that mary jane ended up being not only more attractive but more fun and more interesting and we finally decided to let peter end up with her but it was  as though the characters had taken over the names mary jane and mj are also common slang terms for marijuana when asked about this stan lee claimed it was purely coincidental that he knew nothing about drugs and never tried marijuana gerry conway succeeded stan lee as writer of the amazing spiderman in  conway pushed mary jane to the forefront of the cast and made her a serious love interest for peter parker like lee conway found mary jane to be more compelling than gwen mary jane hadnt lost the edge that made her an interesting character gwen didnt have an edge she was just a nice person i dont think she had a mean bone in her body and wasnt likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for peter out of some misguided sense of selfaggrandizement which mary jane was quite capable of doing  which makes her a much more interesting character in  the character was married to spiderman in the amazing spiderman annual  as a consequence writer j m dematteis made mary jane and her marriage to spiderman one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed kravens last hunt published the same year as the wedding dematteis commented that kraven’s last hunt has a lot of darkness in it but the story primarily is about peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love the reason peter makes it out is because he has mary jane in his life and that is his salvation marvel editorinchief joe quesada said that he feels the marriage ages the characters making them less appealing to young readers and lessens the dramatic soap opera possibilities but also stated that divorcing or widowing or annulling the marriage would only be worse he has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated stan lee decided to marry the characters in his daily newspaper strip and even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series it was decided to marry them in the regular marvel universe as well in  quesada presided over the controversial one more day storyline which he also drew in which peter and mary janes marriage is erased from history and everyones memories by the devil mephisto quesada states he is an avid fan of the peter and mj relationship and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate mc universe in which peter and mary jane are happily married is a natural progression of the characters the erasing of peter and mary janes marriage was initially adopted in the newspaper strip as well but due to negative reader reaction lee later revealed it to be a bad dream mary jane remains spidermans wife in the newspaper strip continuity fictional character biographyedit early historyedit mary jane is depicted as

actually seen until the amazing spiderman  november  peter david wrote in  that artist john romita sr made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant that blocked the readers view of her face in issue  and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used annmargret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her formfitting short skirts according to cocreator stan lee he and romita had intended for gwen stacy to be spidermans one true love and introduced mary jane just for fun but that somehow mary jane seemed to have all the personality and much as we tried to make gwen more attractive we couldnt we ourselves felt that mary jane ended up being not only more attractive but more fun and more interesting and we finally decided to let peter end up with her but it was  as though the characters had taken over the names mary jane and mj are also common slang terms for marijuana when asked about this stan lee claimed it was purely coincidental that he knew nothing about drugs and never tried marijuana gerry conway succeeded stan lee as writer of the amazing spiderman in  conway pushed mary jane to the forefront of the cast and made her a serious love interest for peter parker like lee conway found mary jane to be more compelling than gwen mary jane hadnt lost the edge that made her an interesting character gwen didnt have an edge she was just a nice person i dont think she had a mean bone in her body and wasnt likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for peter out of some misguided sense of selfaggrandizement which mary jane was quite capable of doing

spiderman one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed kravens last hunt published the same year as the wedding dematteis commented that kraven’s last hunt has a lot of darkness in it but the

editorinchief joe quesada said that he feels the marriage ages the characters making them less appealing to young readers and lessens the dramatic soap opera possibilities but also stated that divorcing or widowing or annulling the marriage would only be worse he has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated stan lee decided to marry the characters in his daily newspaper strip and even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series it was decided to marry them in the regular marvel universe as well in  quesada presided over the controversial one more day storyline which he also drew in which peter and mary janes marriage is erased from history and everyones memories by the devil mephisto quesada states he is an avid fan of the peter and mj relationship and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate mc universe in which peter and mary jane are happily married is a natural progression of the characters the

references  external links publication historyedit mary jane watson is first mentioned in the amazing spiderman  august  and is initially used as a running joke of the series as peter parkers aunt may repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her parker also known as spiderman consistently worms his way out of meeting mary jane who aside from a brief appearance in  june  with her face obscured is never actually seen until the amazing spiderman  november  peter david wrote in  that artist john romita sr made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant that blocked the readers view of her face in issue  and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used annmargret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her formfitting short skirts according to cocreator stan lee he and romita had intended for gwen stacy to be spidermans one true love and introduced mary jane just for fun but that somehow mary jane seemed to have all the personality and much as we tried to make gwen more attractive we couldnt we ourselves felt that mary jane ended up being not only more attractive but more fun and more interesting and we finally decided to let peter end up with her but it was  as though the characters had taken over the names mary jane and mj are also common slang terms for marijuana when asked about this stan lee claimed it was purely coincidental that he knew nothing about drugs and never tried marijuana gerry conway succeeded stan lee as writer of the amazing spiderman in  conway pushed mary jane to the forefront of the cast and made her a serious love interest for peter parker like lee conway found mary jane to be more compelling than gwen mary jane hadnt lost the edge that made her an interesting character gwen didnt have an edge she was just a nice person i dont think she had a mean bone in her body and wasnt likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for peter out of some misguided sense of selfaggrandizement which mary jane was quite capable of doing  which makes her a much more interesting character in  the character was married to spiderman in the amazing spiderman annual  as a consequence writer j m dematteis made mary jane and her marriage to spiderman one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed kravens last hunt published the same year as the wedding dematteis commented that kraven’s last hunt has a lot of darkness in it but the story primarily is about peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love the reason peter makes it out is because he has mary jane in his life and that is his salvation marvel editorinchief joe quesada said that he feels the marriage ages the characters making them less appealing to young readers and lessens the dramatic soap opera possibilities but also stated that divorcing or widowing or annulling the marriage would only be worse he has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated stan lee decided to marry the characters in his daily newspaper strip and even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series it was decided to marry them in the regular marvel universe as well in  quesada presided over the controversial one more day storyline which he also drew in which peter and mary janes marriage is erased from history and everyones memories by the devil mephisto quesada states he is an avid fan of the peter and mj relationship and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate mc universe in which peter and mary jane are happily married is a natural progression of the characters the erasing of peter and mary janes marriage was initially adopted in the newspaper strip as well but due to negative reader reaction lee later revealed it to be a bad dream mary

repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her parker also known as spiderman consistently worms his way out of meeting mary jane who aside from a brief appearance in  june  with her face obscured is never actually seen until the amazing spiderman  november  peter david wrote in  that artist john romita sr made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant that blocked the readers view of her face in issue  and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used annmargret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her formfitting short skirts according to cocreator stan lee he and romita had intended for gwen stacy to be spidermans one true love and introduced mary jane just for fun but that somehow mary jane seemed to have all the personality and much as we tried to make gwen more attractive we couldnt we ourselves felt that mary jane ended up being not only more attractive but more fun and more interesting and we finally decided to let peter end up with her but it was  as though the characters had taken over the names mary jane and mj are also common slang terms for marijuana when asked about this stan lee claimed it was purely coincidental that he knew nothing about drugs and never tried marijuana gerry conway succeeded stan lee as writer of the amazing spiderman in  conway pushed mary jane to the forefront of the cast and made her a serious love interest for peter parker like lee conway found mary jane to be more compelling than gwen mary jane hadnt lost the edge that made her an interesting character gwen didnt have an edge she was just a nice person i dont think she had a mean bone in her body and wasnt likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for peter out of some misguided sense of selfaggrandizement which mary jane was quite capable of doing  which makes her a much more interesting character in  the character was married to spiderman in the amazing spiderman annual  as a consequence writer j m dematteis made mary jane and her marriage to spiderman one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed kravens last hunt published the same year as the wedding dematteis commented that kraven’s last hunt has a lot of darkness in it but the story primarily is about peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love the reason peter makes it out is because he has mary jane in his life and that is his salvation marvel editorinchief joe quesada said that he feels the marriage ages the characters making them less appealing to young readers and lessens the dramatic soap opera possibilities but also stated that divorcing or widowing or annulling the marriage would only be worse he has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated stan lee decided to marry the characters in his daily newspaper strip and even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series it was decided to marry them in the regular marvel universe as well in  quesada presided over the controversial one more day storyline which he also drew in which peter and mary janes marriage is erased from history and everyones memories by the devil mephisto quesada states he is an avid fan of the peter and mj relationship and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate mc universe in which peter and mary jane are happily married is a natural progression of the characters the erasing of peter and mary janes marriage was initially adopted in the newspaper strip as well but due to negative reader reaction lee later revealed it to be a bad dream mary jane remains spidermans wife in the newspaper strip continuity fictional character biographyedit early historyedit mary jane is depicted as an extremely beautiful greeneyed redhead and has been the

repeatedly attempts to set her unwilling nephew up on a date with her parker also known as spiderman consistently worms his way out of meeting mary jane who aside from a brief appearance in  june  with her face obscured is never actually seen until the amazing spiderman  november  peter david wrote in  that artist john romita sr made the definitive statement of his arrival by pulling mary jane out from behind the oversized potted plant that blocked the readers view of her face in issue  and placing her on panel in what would instantly become an iconic moment romita has stated that in designing mary jane he used annmargret from the movie bye bye birdie as a guide using her coloring the shape of her face her red hair and her formfitting short skirts according to cocreator stan lee he and romita had intended for gwen stacy to be spidermans one true love and introduced mary jane just for fun but that somehow mary jane seemed to have all the personality and much as we tried to make gwen more attractive we couldnt we ourselves felt that mary jane ended up being not only more attractive but more fun and more interesting and we finally decided to let peter end up with her but it was  as though the characters had taken over the names mary jane and mj are also common slang terms for marijuana when asked about this stan lee claimed it was purely coincidental that he knew nothing about drugs and never tried marijuana gerry conway succeeded stan lee as writer of the amazing spiderman in  conway pushed mary jane to the forefront of the cast and made her a serious love interest for peter parker like lee conway found mary jane to be more compelling than gwen mary jane hadnt lost the edge that made her an interesting character gwen didnt have an edge she was just a nice person i dont think she had a mean bone in her body and wasnt likely to do something that was likely to screw things up for peter out of some misguided sense of selfaggrandizement which mary jane was quite capable of doing  which makes her a much more interesting character in  the character was married to spiderman in the amazing spiderman annual  as a consequence writer j m dematteis made mary jane and her marriage to spiderman one of the central themes of the critically acclaimed kravens last hunt published the same year as the wedding dematteis commented that kraven’s last hunt has a lot of darkness in it but the story primarily is about peter and his journey into the light and the power of simple human love the reason peter makes it out is because he has mary jane in his life and that is his salvation marvel editorinchief joe quesada said that he feels the marriage ages the characters making them less appealing to young readers and lessens the dramatic soap opera possibilities but also stated that divorcing or widowing or annulling the marriage would only be worse he has also pointed out that the marriage itself was editorially mandated stan lee decided to marry the characters in his daily newspaper strip and even though the two were not even dating at the time in the comic book series it was decided to marry them in the regular marvel universe as well in  quesada presided over the controversial one more day storyline which he also drew in which peter and mary janes marriage is erased from history and everyones memories by the devil mephisto quesada states he is an avid fan of the peter and mj relationship and in several interviews has claimed that the alternate mc universe in which peter and mary jane are happily married is a natural progression

original concept as peter suits up to become spiderman his origin with uncle ben is only hinted at mary jane sets out to expose norman with peters help the novel was successful with teenage girls who were not familiar with the comics but was met with criticism from the core fans due to its characterization of some of the characters most notably harry osborn who is portrayed as manipulating peter into doing his homework while treating him horribly and changing continuity the second novel mary jane  deals with the continuing relationship of peter and mary jane and the emergence of gwen stacy in
