associates lp qvt global ii lp and medivation inc defendants united states district court sd new york october   opinion  order harold baer jr district judge plaintiff steven goldstein an alleged shareholder of nominal defendant medivation inc medivation brings this action pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of   usc § bp in order to recover shortswing insider trading profits allegedly realized by defendants qvt associates llc qvt overseas ltd quintessence fund lp qvt associates lp and qvt global ii lp collectively the qvt defendants the complaint alleges that the qvt defendants as a group within the meaning of the exchange act owned more than  percent of medivations outstanding stock that within a period of less than six months the qvt defendants purchased and sold medivation stock at a profit and that section b requires the disgorgement of that profit to medivation a public company that trades on nasdaq on may   the qvt defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on june   the court heard oral argument on the motion the critical questions at this stage in the litigation are  whether plaintiff has met the demand requirement as set forth in section b of the exchange act and  whether plaintiff has plausibly pleaded the existence of a section  group among the qvt defendants for the reasons that follow the court concludes that plaintiff has overcome that burden accordingly the motion to dismiss must be denied i factual background there are five interrelated qvt entities named as defendants in this action quintessence fund lp qvt associates lp and qvt global ii lp are usbased limited partnership investment funds that allegedly owned medivation common stock hereinafter the us funds complt ¶¶  defendant qvt associates gp llc is the general partner of the us funds and allegedly held a pecuniary interest in the securities they owned id at ¶  defendant qvt overseas ltd is a cayman islandsbased fund with distinct investors id at ¶  the complaint alleges that nonparty qvt financial lp directed the vote and disposition of medivation common stock for the us funds and the cayman islands fund together the advised funds plaintiff alleges that all the qvt entities are related with qvt financial lp in control of voting and investment decisions for all four of the advised funds the complaint alleges that as of january   the qvt defendants collectively owned over  of the outstanding common stock of medivation in a schedule ga filed with the sec on that date the qvt entities stated that qvt overseas beneficially owned  shares of common stock and the us funds beneficially owned an aggregate amount of  shares complt ¶  fruchter decl ex a at  this comprised  percent and  percent respectively of medivations outstanding common stock for a total of  percent see oral argument defs ex a at the end of  the qvt entities filed another schedule ga that provided details about the qvt entities beneficial ownership complt ¶  as of december   qvt overseas owned  shares of common stock and the us funds beneficially owned an aggregate of  shares this comprised  percent and  percent respectively of medivations outstanding common stock for a total of  percent see oral argument defs ex a a year later at the end of  medivation filed a schedule ga in which qvt overseas is listed as the beneficial owner of  shares of common stock and the us funds are named as the beneficial owner of  shares see fruchter decl ex c at  this comprised  percent and  percent respectively of medivations outstanding common stock for a total of  percent see defs ex a oral arg of jun   all three schedules filed with the sec state explicitly that qvt financial has the power to direct the vote and disposition of the common stock held by qvt overseas ltd and each of the us funds see fruchter decl ex a at  ex b at  ex c at  with respect to the shortswing profits allegedly realized by the qvt defendants as beneficial owners of medivation stock the complaint alleges seven purchases or sales of medivation stock by the qvt entities on march   june   september   december   march   june   and september   meaning that there were several instances of a purchaseandsale within six months the statutory short swing period iii discussion a legal standard a complaint will be dismissed under rule b if there is a failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted fedrcivpb to survive a motion to dismiss under rule b a plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face bell atl corp v twombly  us    see also landmen partners inc v blackstone group lp  fsuppd   sdny  a facially plausible claim is one where the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged ashcroft v iqbal  sct    where the court finds wellpleaded factual allegations it should assume their veracity and determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief id at  in addition to wellpleaded factual allegations in the complaint a court may consider any written instrument attached to the complaint statements or documents incorporated into the complaint by reference legally required public disclosure documents filed with the sec and documents possessed by or known to the plaintiff and upon which it relied in bringing the suit atsi commcns v shaar fund ltd  fd   d cir  in re morgan stanley tech fund secs litig nos  civ   civ  bsj  wl  sdny feb  applying atsi to securities act claims affd  fd  d cir  a demand requirement section b of the exchange act permits derivative actions by shareholders suing on behalf of an issuer the act requires however that the plaintiff in a section b action meet the demand requirement set forth by the statute which provides in relevant part suit to recover such profit may be instituted    by the issuer or by the owner of any security of the issuer in the name and on behalf of the issuer if the issuer shall fail or refuse to bring such suit within  days after request  usc § pb the qvt defendants argue that the complaint must be dismissed because plaintiff has failed to meet the demand requirement as set forth in the statute specifically defendants contend that plaintiff goldstein lacks standing to sue because a different shareholder mark levy made the demand upon medivation on december   the statutory text however does not require that the plaintiff who ultimately initiates an action must be the same shareholder who demanded suit the text itself specifies that a shareholder may initiate an action if the issuer fails to bring such suit within  days after request  usc § pb furthermore congress intended to grant standing to a broad class of plaintiffs in section b suits the statutory definitions identifying the class of plaintiffs other than the issuer who may bring suit indicate that congress intended to grant enforcement standing of considerable breadth gollust v mendell  us    the purpose of the demand requirement is to afford the issuer a reasonable opportunity to assert and prosecute its claim in its own name for the recovery of profits from the insider henss v fruehauf trailer corp et al  fsupp   sdny  weinfeld j noting that corporations failure to take action within sixty days means that the right to sue passes to the security holders here demand for prosecution was made upon medivation on december   complt ¶  counsel for the qvt defendants allegedly responded by letter on february   asserting that none of qvts advised funds    directly or beneficially owned more than  of the registered class of medivation stock during the period therefore the qvt funds are not subject to section  the response from the qvt defendants clearly indicates that medivation received the shareholder demand and communicated with the qvt defendants as to their ownership of medivation stock and potential liability medivation declined to sue and this derivative action was properly initiated on march   more than  days after the demand thus the court declines to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that plaintiff has failed to meet the demand requirement the qvt defendants assert that even if levys december   demand was timely it was insufficient to support the complaint insofar as it did not purport to cover transactions from october   to march   which the complaint does given that we must take as true the facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party the demand must be presumed adequate as to all of plaintiffs allegations see rescuecom corp v google inc  fd   d cir  b section b next is whether the defendants are entitled to a ruling that as a matter of law no section b group existed among the qvt defendants such that they were prohibited from engaging in the purchase and sale of securities inside the sixmonth short swing period section  of the exchange act with respect to any company whose securities are registered on a national securities exchange imposes certain obligations and restrictions on the companys officers directors and every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than  percent of any class of any equity security other than an exempted security  usc § pba congress defined directors officers and beneficial owners as those presumed to have access to insider information and enacted section b of the exchange act to prohibit certain trades by such insiders roth v jennings  f   d cir  citing foremostmckesson inc v provident securities co  us    section b provides in relevant part b profits from purchase and sale of security within six months for the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner director or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale or sale and purchase of any equity security of such issuer other than an exempted security    within any period of less than six months    shall insure to and be recoverable by the issuer irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner director or officer     usc § bp profits that result from purchaseandsale or saleandrepurchase transactions within a period of less than six months are commonly known as shortswing transactions see roth  fd at  sec rule aa  cfr § aa section b imposes strict liability for any shortswing insider transaction  usc § bp foremostmckesson  us at  congresss purpose in prohibiting such transactions was to take the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great reliance electric co v emerson electric co  us    the exchange act recognizes that the abuses that it targets may be accomplished by persons acting not individually but in combination with others roth  fd at  therefore a beneficial owner under the exchange act need not be an individual but may be a group of the sort that plaintiff alleges existed among the qvt defendants with respect to the definition of a beneficial owner under section  sec rule aa provides that solely for purposes of determining whether a person is a beneficial owner of more than ten percent of any class of equity securities the term beneficial owner means with exceptions not pertinent here any person who is deemed a beneficial owner pursuant to section d of the act and the rules thereunder  cfr § aa section d provides in turn that when two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring holding voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer such syndicate or group shall be deemed a person for the purposes of this subsection  usc § md the sec promulgated a rule under this statute which provides in relevant part when two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring holding voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial ownership sec rule db  cfr § db thus if two or more entities agree to act together for any of the listed purposes a group is formed see roth  fd  at  thus the touchstone of a group within the meaning of section d is that the members combined in furtherance of a common objective wellman v dickinson  fd   d cir  cert denied  us   the second circuit interprets the common objective requirement broadly the plain language of the statute does not require a group to be committed to any specific set of terms but rather demands only an agreement for the purpose of acquiring holding or disposing of securities morales v freund  fd   n d cir  morales v quintel entertainment inc  fd   d cir  evidence that group members might not always made identical investment decisions does not preclude existence of agreement id at  see also roth  fd  at  the qvt defendants maintain that each of the advised funds has separate investors and there never any agreement among the qvt entities to act together to purchase and sell securities thus according to the qvt defendants there is no statutory group that can be held liable for short sales qvt contends on this basis that the complaint must be dismissed because no individual qvt entity ever owned more than  of medivations common stock and therefore plaintiffs section  claim must fail however the schedules that qvt filed with the sec state explicitly that qvt financial has the power to direct the vote and disposition of the common stock held by qvt overseas ltd and each of the us funds see fruchter decl ex a at  ex b at  ex c at  a bare allegation of common control is standing alone insufficient to give rise to an inference of the agreement that is necessary to an existence of a section d group neubauer v evahealth usa inc  frd   sdny  further here the pleading infers that the entities are a section d group with respect to the dealings in the securities of the third entity strauss v american holdings inc  fsupp   sdny  in strauss the complaint alleged that the president and ceo of a corporation was also the sole general partner of another entity a limited partnership judge kaplan ruled that these allegations permitted the inference that an agreement was formed to act together with respect to the securities of a third party id at  furthermore inconsistencies in the trading patterns between the corporation and the limited partnership did not change the strauss courts conclusion that the allegations in the complaint were sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss id at  here we face a similar situation the trading patterns of the us funds and the cayman islandsbased qvt overseas ltd are not identical but keeping in mind that the thrust of section b is to prevent those with substantial share holdings — ie greater than ten percent — who may have access to inside information from profiting from their insider status foremostmckesson inc  us at  and that this is a strict liability provision the complaint contains allegations sufficient to permit this court to draw the reasonable inference see iqbal  sct at  that the qvt defendants were beneficial owners of more than ten percent of medivations common stock and engaged in shortswing trading in that stock in  and  conclusion for the foregoing reasons defendants motion to dismiss the complaint is denied the parties are directed to proceed in accordance with the pretrial scheduling order of may   so ordered comment your name your email comments
