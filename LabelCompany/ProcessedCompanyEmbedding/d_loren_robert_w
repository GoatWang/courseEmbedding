close menu leaders in luxury robert w d’loren chairman and chief executive officer xcel brands name robert w dlorentitle chairman and chief executive officerorganization xcel brands robert w d’loren is the chairman and chief executive officer of xcel brands which owns the isaac mizrahi brand last year bought judith ripka and holds an interest in the liz claiborne new york brand the company has been a pioneer in omnichannel sales and marketing including a partnership with qvc providing access to over  million global households a former race car driver and polo player the bold face name entrepreneur recently spoke with elite traveler editorinchief doug gollan about how he plans to weave the venerable jewelry brand into his high powered distribution network and how luxury goods will be bought and sold in the not too distant future   elite traveler can you give us a history of how you got to this point   robert d’loren this really all started about  years ago as a finance company  it was a joint venture at that time between myself charles koppelman the former chairman of emi music and prudential securities it was based on a thought that we had to take income streams associated with intellectual property whether it be film copyrights musical or copyrights and structure those flows into rated bonds transactions we started that company through prudential securities and we wrote the book on intellectual property financing intellectual property securitization and structured finance one challenge we had to deal with was to get the ratings agencies on board we had to develop what is known in the industry as a “backup operator platform” which means if something went wrong in the bond deal the ratings agencies wanted to know that we could take over and operate   apparel was different because a trademark is not quite a musical copyright or film copyright  so we developed the expertise to operate apparel companies as retail consolidated and a lot of production in virtually every sector began to move offshore control over margin in the consumer sector shifted from manufacturers to retailers that was a very disruptive series of events in the consumer sector  in  we recapped a company called candies shoes and we closed down its supply chain business and we licensed the brand directly to kohl’s  that company became iconix brand group which today owns  plus brands   three years ago we saw another change that disruption is the control over margin has now shifted from retailers to consumers because of smart phones  today it’s all about social media  it started to change our point of view on brands as well  to drive brands socially you need dynamic active and authentic voices they also forgot about the most important driver in the social world and that’s entertainment more specifically television     et how did you advantage television and entertainment   rdl we knew the power of television and we also knew it was the infomercial that was driving sales three years ago i went to see mike george qvc’s ceo and chairman i asked him what he was doing to become omni  i suggested we would buy brands that have personalities that we could drive social and he would sell on his network  then we made that deal with qvc  today we have three brands with qvc including liz claiborne new york isaac mizrahi judith ripka  the company has grown from  million in sales to roughly  million in three years   et so the ways of retail are shifting significantly   rdl  these are the new rules of retail and that’s the way it works i think of us as a heard of gazelles as opposed to an  pound gorilla  we move with our partners  we move with our licensing partners and our retail partners and frankly our celebrity partners  it’s one movement at the same time together  our job is to keep it all coordinated   et  and what’s the impact on going to the store   rdl  we don’t think bricks and mortar shopping going away  we think people will always want that experience but we do see more shoppers moving to online  we believe in television and online convergence a true interactive tv within the next  months   et what would be an example of that   rdl there will be a time when we will watch a show and at the bottom of the screen you’ll wave your hand and all the products that are being worn and all the furniture in the set will be available for sale you’ll say to your television search all brands for that red dress in my size then you’ll scroll and be able to shop   et so within  months if i turn on a sitcom this will be an option   rdl it’s all a matter of time  look at what’s coming from twitter and facebook  twitter is now testing the ‘buy it now’ button  so think about someone like shakira who is the fourth most followed person on the planet  when she takes a selfie she posts the brand of her shoes bottom top bag and posts it to facebook  then the followers can buy it   et will this model work for luxury products   rdl i think people’s comfort with buying luxury items online will increase over time it’s all about trust and there are some interesting models that are sort of hybrids  there’s an interesting jewelry company in the market today called ritani ritani is an online business and you can buy an engagement ring but what they do is that you can order it online but you pick it up a local jeweler who is a ritani affiliate  but there will come a time where the customer will be confident enough in companies like that to just buy from them   et how does judith ripka fit into this vision   rdl  judith has been an absolutely brilliant designer for the past  years and an accomplished entrepreneur she had eight retail stores around the country all positioned as luxury stores our strategy for judith is to take it back a little to go forward  we needed to close nonperforming stores  the plan is to continue to operate the madison avenue store and the east hill long island store to reposition the brand back into best retail distribution so neiman marcus saks bloomingdales which we’ve done   judith and qvc work very well together  we’re a leading jewelry brand for them  i think one of the incredible things about our jewelry business on qvc is our price points are from  to a high of   twenty percent of our business is in items over  which i think speaks to the consumer’s willingness and understanding of the value of judith ripka’s jewelry et are there opportunities to expand judith ripka beyond jewelry   rdl  watches footwear handbags and accessories are part of the plan   et  any other acquisitions on the horizon   rdl we’re not an acquisitive company  we have a very strong organic growth potential here  we have acquired two brands in the last three years  the answer is if there is an opportunity that is strategic to us which means that it has to help us grow in the channels that we’re in it is a possibility related leaders in
