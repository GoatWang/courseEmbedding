good morning everyone the pleasure to share our results for what is my first full quarter with cna we had a good quarter both financially and operationally each of our pc segments posted underlying combined ratio that were the same or better than a year ago when commercial is adjusted for its premium development we posted favorable loss reserve development in each of our pc segments rate improved modestly as retention held strong across the pc segments we avoided outside catastrophe losses our expense base was smaller investment income was strong and our longterm care business continues to perform at a breakeven level but before we go into more detail on our results let me first talk about what we are working on operationally the time has gone by quickly as we have been actively working to further strengthen the organization youll recall that my primary objective is to improve our performance indeed to build a disciplined underwriting culture specifically focused on growing our underwriting profits significant effort is being invested to both continually enhance the expertise of our talent and to supplement our team with selective hires from across the pc supply chain early in the first quarter you may have seen the announcement of our new role as chief underwriting officer the role was created to further strengthen our underwriting governance and to develop more profitable growth opportunities in this role doug worman’s first priority working together with the leaders of our three pc segment is to institutionalize the collaboration among the underwriting claims actuarial risk control enterprise risk management and analytics teams the closer the alignment and the more timely and effective the feedback loops among the teams the more efficient we will be at utilizing all sophisticated tools at our disposal to grow our underwriting profits and to be more effective at embedding lessons learned across our entire employee base there is tremendous capability in our organization and an imperative to drive needed improvement just to more quickly and seamlessly bring those collective capabilities to bear on our opportunities and issues this profit takes more time than one quarter but ’s senior management team has emerged from the starting gate with tremendous conviction and our employees have responded quite favorably to the new focus in fact the energy has been raised to such a level that the momentum is starting to build on itself across the organization of course our focus is not just internal in the first quarter as seen us bring our underwriting mission to the marketplace and reintroduced our meaningful value proposition of sophisticated products and services to our agents and brokers together with our executive management team i have personally been involved in a number of highlevel strategic discussions with agents and brokers and have been very encouraged by the reception we are getting additionally the leadership of our commercial segment spent many weeks of the quarter visiting our branch locations providing advanced training highlighting best practices across the various levers that all of our underwriters utilize during these visits they also spent significant time with key agents and brokers to reinforce cnas capabilities moreover we continue to strengthen the specialty segment through some select hires to further fortify our underwriting talent available in the market in addition our international segment leadership has had strategic meetings with brokers to ensure that we are reinforcing both our domestic value proposition in canada europe and the uk as well as our multinational capability bottomline everyone is very engaged internally and externally to build and demonstrate our strong value proposition over time this consistent focus and underwriting discipline and producer relationship will lead to greater access to more highquality new business and improve the overall underwriting performance all the while we continue to reinforce a clear bias towards expense discipline the quarters expense ratio showed improvement from a combination of  actions as well as early benefits of coupling an emphasis on challenging the status quo to gain process efficiency and productivity gains which strict accountability with that let me make a few high level comments on our first quarter financial results and then craig will provide much more detail by business unit net operating earnings were  million or  per share in the first quarter of  and a marked improvement from the first quarter  to  million net operating return on equity was about  our pc business generated a  combined ratio in the first quarter a point higher than  first quarter results however the result was inflated by nearly  points due to a premium adjustment in our small business unit within the commercial segment which craig will describe in more detail later excluding this adjustment our combined ratio was  nearly  points lower than the first quarter  including a loss ratio of  the underlying combined ratio which excludes the impact of catastrophes in prior year development was  and improvement of nearly a point from the first quarter of  driven by the expense ratio which was  our pc net written premiums excluding the small business premium adjustment grew about  as retention remains strong and rates were slightly higher in all three segments reported net written premium growth was down  as the result of the premium adjustment highquality new business continues to be difficult to come by but it does exist acquiring it requires more focused prospecting and greater underwriter effort and reinforcing the relative benefits of our value propositions in order to judicially win more of the highquality new business that is written by our peers in particular where the customers and the niches we have targeted for years with tailored products and services and for which we have industryleading expertise our efforts are gaining traction as evidenced by our modest increase in new business in the first quarter for commercial specifically in our key middle market segments more generally in terms of industry dynamics the pc marketplace in the us remains competitive but stable with market pricing trends generally in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter of  and terms and conditions are essentially rational of course you can always find pockets of what appears to be inappropriately aggressive quotes fortunately we have the underwriting expertise to see clear of these accounts outside the us it is essentially the same story for cna lloyds business continues to be under greater pressure with more aggressive pricing and the team there as well as the teams at all our location know that we place no undue pressure to produce growth for growth sake our focus is to grow underwriting profits our life  group segment had net operating income of  million for the quarter continuing to be near breakeven since s unlocking event the longterm care favorable morbidity trends offset unfavorable persistency overall a longterm care book continues to perform as anticipated and were continuing to get approval with needed reductions from many state regulators we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve review in the first quarter this years review resulted in a  million increase to reserves for asbestos and environmental liabilities that has been series to national indemnity as a part of our  loss portfolio transfer the resulting  million aftertax charge contributed to the corporate segment net operating loss of  million in the quarter compared with loss of  million in the first quarter of  a significant yearoveryear improvement we are also pleased to announce our regular dividend of  per share and with that ill turn it over to craig craig mense thanks dino good morning everyone our first quarter  net operating income was  million and net income was  million much improved from last years first quarter results and the reflective of steady underwriting performance favorable loss reserve development across all three pc business segments reduced expense spend another small positive earnings contributions from life  group and a significant positive net investment income contribution our property and casual operations produced net operating income of  million nearly  above the prioryear quarter this earnings achievement was despite the dampening impact of the small business premium adjustment notably our improving underwriting discipline is evident in both pc operations underlying loss ratio at  which is a little over  point better than where we ended the fullyear of  and our  million of favorable loss reserve development which is consistent with last years first quarter the small business premium adjustment affected both our reported property and casualty and commercial business segment results i would ask that you refer to the earnings slide pages  and  where we have outlined the impact on this quarters reported results youll recall last quarter we had identified rating errors in our small business package product and recorded a charge to reflect our decision to voluntarily refund premiums to affected policyholders in our k we noted that we were continuing our review we have now concluded that effort and found that they were also rating errors in our small business workers compensation product consistent with our approach on the package product we will voluntarily refund amounts to affected policyholders the earnings slide highlight how the underlying business is performing and the specific impact of the earned premium charge on our reported results the most significant impact for this premium adjustment at the property and casualty operations level were to reduce our written and earned premium which inflated our combined ratio by  points and lowered our net written premium growth from a positive  to a negative  you will review our reported results that are under any expense dollars then reduced  million or  as compared to the prioryears quarter our adjusted expense ratio of  is approximately one point lower than both the prior years quarter and our  fullyear results i would attribute a little over  of the improvement to actions taken in  and our improving expense culture with the remainder attributable to some favorable expense timing this is true at both the propertycasualty and commercial business segment level our specialty segment had another strong quarter with the calendar year combined ratio of  including a  loss ratio which reflected five points of favorable net prior year development the favorable loss reserve development of  million was driven by a number of our professional liability products predominantly across accident years  through  specialtys underlying combined ratio for the quarter was just below  in line with both the prioryears first quarter and fullyear results with relative consistency in both the underlying loss and expense ratios specialtys netwritten premiums were down  premium rate was up one point in the quarter and retention was a very strong  as shown on slide  our commercial segments adjusted calendar year combined ratio was  commercial adjusted underlying combined ratio was  and approximate one point improvement from prior years quarter and fullyear  results the adjusted underlying loss ratio of  was relatively consistent with the full year  results the adjusted expense ratio of  was more than  points better than the  fullyear results favorable loss reserve development of  million came primarily from commercial auto youll recall that in  and  we strengthened reserves for commercial auto however in recent periods were seeing some of those pressure abating and actual claim outcomes coming in lower than expected commercial net written premiums in the quarter excluding the premium adjustments were up  premium rate was up  point slightly better than recent quarters while retention continue to be strong at  new business in our middlemarket specialized industry segments was a positive contributor our international segment generated a  combined ratios for the quarter including three points of favorable reserve development this is a four point improvement yearoveryear three points of improvement on the loss ratio and one on the expense ratio the logged ph rate impact was not material the underlying combined ratio was  nearly three points better than the prior years first quarter results and  points better than the  fullyear results international segment also benefited from a light cap quarter netwritten premiums were up  rate in retention showed slight improvement to recent quarters our life  group results are consistent with the last few quarters and our expectation the favorable morbidity that dino mentioned is driven by lower frequency also referred to often as incident rates we did close the sale of our life settlement business last quarter but there was no real impact to reported financial results the sale does mark another modest but important effort to continue to reduce volatility and expense at cna net investment income was  million in the first quarter compared with  million in the prioryear quarter as you can see on page  of the earnings slide our limited partnership portfolio had a strong quarter producing  million of pretax income of  return compared with a  million pretax loss in the prior year quarter income from our fixed maturity portfolio was  million compared with  million in the prioryear quarter reflective of a higher invested asset base and steady yields our investment portfolios net unrealized gain was  billion at quarter end a slight increase since the end of the fourth quarter the composition of our investment portfolio is relatively unchanged average credit quality of our fixed maturity portfolio remained at a fixed income assets that support our traditional pc liabilities had an effective duration of just over  years at quarter end inline with portfolio targets the effective duration of the fixed income assets which support our longduration life  group liabilities was  years at quarter end which continues to reflect both the low interest rate environment and our tactical decisions at at march   shareholders equity was  billion and book value per share was  a decrease of  since december  reflecting the  of dividends paid in march shares equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income was  billion book value per share exaoci was  a  increase from yearend  adjusting for the  dividends paid more notably the yearoveryear increase was  adjusting for the  of paid dividends our financial strength and strong liquidity profile are outlined on pages  and  of the earnings slides cash and shortterm investments at the holding company were approximately  million at quarter end we continue to target cash as the holding company equal to approximately one year of our annual net corporate obligations in the first quarter operating cash flow was just under  million we continue to maintain a very conservative capital structure all our capital adequacy and credit metrics are well above our internal targets and current ratings with that ill turn it back to dino dino robusto thanks craig before we move to the questionandanswer portion of the call let me leave you with some summary point each of our pc segments produced an underlying combined ratio equal to or better than the first quarter of  results when you exclude commercial premium adjustment nearly one point improvement in total moreover our pc underlying loss ratio was  more than a  point improvement from the fullyear of  each of our pc segments produced favorable prioryear loss development totaling near four points consistent with the prioryear period underwriting expense dollars were down  rate across our pc segment was almost a point higher in the prior quarter while retention continued strong in mid s a longterm care business continues to be stable and executing efficiently our employee as well as our agents and brokers have responded very favorably to our reinvigorated underwriting focus with that we will be glad to take your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well have our first question from josh shanker deutsche bank josh shanker i guess my first question goes to craig i wonder if you can walk us through the accounting for any losses in the quarter and how that impacts us down the road i brought that the losses show up on the pl but theyre actually going to  i need your refresh on that i guess craig mense all right we’ll recall that the growth seated losses are the first starting points so weve increased those  million so given the fact that we’re already in a gain position relative to the contract you would add that  to what is already almost  million gain position we can give you a specific numbers in the call back josh to make sure we’re given this to you accurately but what then happens is that you have to essentially refresh your calculation of how you take into account the deferred gain and what youre allowed to do is recognize the gain in proportion to the paid losses against your estimated full liabilities so right now were at about  of paid loss to where we are estimate reserves which is  billion so  billion or so against the  billion so what then happens so we think there is a deferred gain on the balance sheet and as losses are paid over the course of this year and future years we’ll recognize the rest of that deferred gain josh shanker and the amortization that gain is included in the net income number but not the operating income number craig mense no it’s in the operating income number and it is in the corporate josh shanker it’s in the operating as well craig mense yes josh shanker and so what was offsetting gain in this quarter craig mense well the offsetting  we put up the  million or so about  of that would be offset and then you also have the amortization of the rest of it so essentially this quarters pretax income is a  million pretax hit to operating income and  million aftertax josh shanker okay im still going to work on that a little bit but ill come back to you and then i guess for dino thinking about a  combined ratio is it general idea for the pc industry where we are given industry interest as you try and improve things are you also running up against this unusual time where insurance is possibly written below  how should we think about improvements we made at cna and the backdrop of i guess rising interest rates pushing the envelope about what is possible dino robusto not sure i got exactly josh which are asking there josh shanker so it is impossible over the longterm to be much better than  combined dino robusto sure and i think as i mentioned on the last call right i think about it right now our own goals and objective on sort of this absolute basis right i sort of track the  to  you know sort of peer companies that we compete with our target business with a little mathematical exercise take a look at the top sort of four or five look over the last couple of years what there combined ratio is coming at right now if you look at that cohort in the top performing we have to close the gap about four to five points which i think is going to come from a combination of both the loss ratio and the expense ratio and what we need to do here continue to improve it is drives many of the things that i talked about on my earlier remarks and we put in operational goals across the management team to make sure that we’re achieving this target it’s going to take a little bit of time for us but we are moving forward with real urgency and so we clearly do see the ability to do that in the long term without a doubt josh shanker and we assume to be closing that gap and thinking about those top four or five performers is the gap going to be closed by you improving solely or are their numbers going to deteriorate in a higher interest environment dino robusto yes i understand the question it tends why right as i talk about setting the goal right you can look at it in the absolute or the relative and i think what you need to do is look at it in the right so we constantly take a look at this number it’s again just a mathematical exercise you want to say the best performing companies are able to achieve this that’s where you want to be and so thats what we want to do and that we’re going to close that relative gap and we’re going to keep it on a relative basis which means that it could come from both ends of that spectrum from the right or from the left the objective being look you decide what the best performing are doing you want to get there you keep an eye on it you set the right goals and you tell the team it can be done and this is what we’re focused on but i hope that answers it for you josh shanker wish you luck with it operator we’ll go next to bob glasspiegel with janney bob glasspiegel good morning cna so the adjusted expense ratio of  is that a sort of fair run rate and can you improve from that without any help from premium growth dino robusto yes so good morning it’s dino yes so as craig indicated right excluding the premium adjustment it was a function of some of the actions that we had put in place in  the expense gone to a little bit of the timing so right now running in the sort of low s and we think its likely going to be in that range in  so you should think about it in terms of about a half to one point better than what we saw in  so we’re making progress bob glasspiegel where is the longterm goal of where you want to be you mentioned that thats a key focus to help you narrow the gap versus the industry dino robusto yes indeed and just going back to the prior answer as we closed what i consider to be an important relative gap anticipated say combination of the loss ratio and expense ratio if you look at the gap now against a sort of cohort average over a couple of years it’s probably a couple of points on loss ratio and it’s about two to three points on expense ratio now whether it’s going to play up precisely to the tenth of a percent not certain but that’s what we’re looking at and that’s where we’re focused on bob glasspiegel thank you and just following up on joshs question how much im trying to limp through the cagr can’t quite make this out how much of the berkshire cover have you utilized either were paid or incurred basis craig mense on a seated basis  growth seated basis we’ve used  against the four on a paid its a little over  billion bob glasspiegel and this year you incurred you said  million craig mense i said we increased our growth seated by  million bob glasspiegel right craig mense and what i said was the incurred impact was  pretax and  after for the impact to that increase bob glasspiegel im just trying to say though you got  billion left to go on a gross basis and youve used  million just trying to see the survival rate sort of  and whats the right numbers to think about craig mense well i’m not sure i think that remember that it’s  billion cover so if there is a little over  billion paid we’re going to look at it against the limit right there is  still left against the limit bob glasspiegel on a paid basis craig mense on a paid basis right on incurred basis as we said we have seated  billion so it’s a  billion still left against the limit bob glasspiegel and  is the right numerators that use against those numbers or… craig mense no not exactly we could be happy to call you back bob as we go through exactly because we had put together some exhibits in prior calls that will probably be helpful if we pull them out and send it to you and then we can just walk through the whole thing but do remember i think most importantly that this incurred increase is not  there is no economic impact so accounting charge and it does get amortized back into income the deferred gain in income over the life of the contract bob glasspiegel i get you there i’m just trying  it seems like a relatively small way sort of the rest of my question unless you’re telling me in the  soft another words craig mense no i would tell you exactly thats what i would help you to take away and this is… bob glasspiegel same way goes mainly related to what craig mense it was just related to slightly elevated payments under no losses so there is nothing no new sources of losses being identified or no new cohort of claims or anything else like that its just a small adjustment that we made this quarter bob glasspiegel are you the first company doing any reviews this year so you know what your findings is of interest to me so appreciated the color and i would like the tutorial again i know youve done it before thanks a lot operator we’ll go next to jeff schmidt william blair jeff schmidt good morning everyone could you touch on loss cost trends in the commercial segment in the little bit more detail maybe touch on the legal environment and medical cost inflation what you’re seeing there dino robusto hi good morning just an overarching commentary first right in terms of lost cost trends we right now actually are not seeing anything yet that there really changing actually weve been seeing a slight improvement rather than duration in commercial specifically to your question in q we saw slightly lower frequency in comps somewhat lower severity in commercial auto in the specialty side just a little bit of detail there little bit of higher frequency trend in healthcare which was a function of aging services which craig had spoken about in prior calls fy management liability the actual our strength was consistent with  now we have seen you know security class actions trending a little bit higher in  but we havent seen any of that manifest itself in our book so again from our vantage point actually not really changing maybe net net slight improvement i don’t know craig was there anything you wanted to add to it craig mense no i think thats exactly the point really not much the two spot that where we have heightened expectation that we build into pricing and reserving are for medical cost inflation and auto loss reserve trend but we havent at the moment  the business is growing in line with that and we certainly don’t see anything else of significant in terms of loss trend wise across the book beyond what dino just mentioned in that small amount of a medical professional jeff schmidt okay and then the commercial auto book i mean obviously there is some issues there with increased frequency and severity book but was illegal at driver of that severity peace more than anything dino robusto no that was minute to take you back to  we saw lost cost trend increasing back in  is what started so we increased reserves pretty significantly in auto in   and  and this is really what youre seeing now is that we had taken underwriting in addition to increasing reserves substantially but also took underwriting actions at that time we got out of the dns auto book that we had we reduced our small business auto writing really essentially got out of our model line small business auto so the combination of the reserve increases and our underwriting actions of  just resulted in  what youve seen today that the severities that we anticipated back there are just playing out at slightly lower claim settlement so thats really the action that youre seeing here at the moment jeff schmidt okay thats helpful thank you operator we’ll go next to ron bobman capital returns ron bobman hi good morning i had some commercial auto questions but you just tackle them other just remaining question is on the adverse development cover craig as it relates to page and the rate of page on the cover im wondering as compared to the expectations as far as the timing of payments when you entered into the agreement has it been quicker slower or generally at the speed of payment that you expected at the contracts inception and that’s it for you thanks craig mense well thanks ron it’s been generally at the speed we expected remember when we bought it we said that we hope to essentially eliminate our asbestos and environmental and pollution exposure and we kind of define that as thinking that there was a  plus year payout term were now into year seven of that payout and so i would tell you that contract is working out exactly as we conceived and constructed it at the moment ron bobman thanks best of luck operator we’ll go next to jay cohen bank of americamerrill lynch jay cohen thanks a couple of questions first is when you talk about the timing issues on the expenses i assume that youre just talking about the kind of the underwriting expenses not acquisition costs dino robusto thats correct jay cohen okay so we need to look at that underwriting expense number in the first quarter as being maybe a little bit better than we would normally have expected craig mense thats exactly right and that’s detailed on  i’d point to page  of the supplement you could see so look at the other underwriting expense line there jay jay cohen got it and then secondly on the runoff business are you seeing any increased interest from potential buyers or reinsurers of that business craig mense what runoff are you referring to jay jay cohen the launch of care business craig mense i would say nothing material we’re certainly active and engaged in that process and in that marketplace and there is always activity and i would even say ever inactivity and we’re highly engaged in it but it hasn’t been a significant shift in appetite at the moment jay cohen got it thanks a lot operator we’ll go next to gary ransom dowling  partners gary ransom yes good morning i wanted to followup on the loss cost question and clearly youre not seeing a whole lot right now so its fairly benign for you but as weve talked with others of your peers there does seem to be some little upticks in some of the gl lines maybe a little bit more propensity to sue and i just wondered if you had seen anything in any of your subsegments that might confirm that or deny that craig mense no gary i would say that that we dont we’ve listened and read the narrative of the other calls and we have not seen a meaningful uptick in litigation activity affecting any of our business lines except what dino mentioned in the medical profession and nursing business but we mentioned that in prior call so we certainly would acknowledge that and our client both would acknowledge that there are greater number of law firms engaged in public do litigation but that hasnt created anything meaningful and well in the way of loss cost or loss cost inflation so no i’m sorry we cant we do not we do not see any of that noise gary ransom okay if i look at your  the rate that you disclose and then look that youre seeing loss ratio improvement it suggest that the loss trends you’re experiencing actually are very benign maybe even down in some cases because youre seeing this improvement with rate that’s maybe just  or so is that correct dino robusto well gary it’s dino we have indicated that they have been relatively benign but it’s not dynamic if you recall i mentioned it on the last mentioned on the last call right there is a number of leverage that i think we can really pull on to improve the underwriting performance and in particular gary when youre not operating i use a phrase internally call the efficient sort of underwriting frontier that’s when you have consistently well performing portfolio of accounts on a riskadjusted basis executed within a competitive expense infrastructure now were not there yet so we have an opportunity to drive improvement even if the earned rate is below loss cost trend which notwithstanding that being denied  benign right the earned off is below so i think there is an opportunity for us to continue to work on this dynamic notwithstanding the rate and loss cost trend dynamic gary ransom all right thank you and one other question on another topic on your limited partnership income being strong is that the same strategy youve had all along there i just wondered if you made any changes or what the average expectation is for that book of investment craig mense well i mean thats a  so i would say that we have not made any recent changes to that portfolio but the structure has been in place for pretty long period of time we have over the last several years shifted from like  hedge funds so it’s little less bias towards the long equity and it’s now about  private equity and real estate so still a little slightly shifted towards private equity from what it used to be but not else wise and this is a superior performance we wouldnt expect to be able to duplicate this every quarter but over the last five years its averaged about  return over the last  years it’s averaged about  return so i believe that kind of helps you gary ransom thank you very much operator we’ll go next to meyer shields kbw meyer shields thanks good morning some small detail questions if i can one the fixed maturity portfolio in pc the average rating moved from a to a minus anything significant or is that just like where we finally cross over the threshold craig mense nothing significant and i think that really that’s driven by sale of some of the agency securities which we use to fund the dividend so in april its back to a but it also tells you kind of where we are relative to the line and whats available in the market meyer shields okay thanks and probably given this too much attention but the timing issue affecting the operating expenses or the underwriting expenses is that a second quarter correction or should we expect that over the year craig mense no i think  all we trying to give you is that the indication that the improvement you saw isnt all going to be there so remember what dino just said little over half of the improvement was actions weve taken a little less than half as things relative to timing but we still expect there to be  to run somewhere in the low  so at the moment meyer shields okay and then last sort of big picture question for dino tom in the past had talked about sort of skepticism towards commercial auto and this worked up pretty well over the last few years how are you thinking about the line not in the immediate but over the longterm is that something that you feel like you can build the necessary underwriting expertise to really build up your share dino robusto at this particular juncture right it served us well the strategy that tom and the management team over the years had adopted which is essentially right you decide what target segments you want to go in you put a value profit together you got a product services and you go you decide what is it that they particularly wants us its risk control it’s a little bit better on the product service a little bit better on the underwriting and the need to fill it out and be able to provide also the auto not really as important so in light of some of the dynamics the economics you know so well about i don’t anticipate that it’s anything that we would change from a strategy standpoint serving us well going after the segments that were doing and there have  as tom has said there is many quarters where youre happy that you have small premium in auto so we’ll stick with the same approach for now meyer shields okay thanks so much operator well go next to cliff galant philadelphia financial cliff galant thank you i want to go back to the opening comments when you were talking a little bit about the alignment different teams in the organization and i was wondering if you could explain a little bit more about what you meant by that may be an example of sort of where cna is today and where you’d want it to be dino robusto yes it’s a great question and it sounds like it is in one sort of tangible strategic initiative but it is core to what i consider to be if you really want to have a very strong underwriting culture and what you have to do is take all the expertise look actuarial has a very specific expertise the claim organization having managed that kind of an organization over the years the insight that adjusters have on the dynamics that’s happening on account is tremendous loss control the risk control people they are out there even before we write these risk examining the exposures getting a good sense for what customers really execute upon and why what’s the motivation our enterprise risk management all of the modeling et cetera so the expertise is there what you have to do is institutionalize that feedback loop and so  and that’s really been a focus for us and it’s looking at it not only from the various lines of business but all kind of postmortems postmortem on large loss and to say okay lets take a look at that lets see what weve learned from this when youre going after certain complex opportunities bringing those teams to bear we’re all here in a same building the question of going up a few floors or sideways along the floor and thats really something then the other thing that were doing because it’s an important one because clearly analytics is really making a difference where it was a little bit more difficult in todays big data and unstructured data information you want to try to automate that process and so what you learn from your claims automatically gets filled in to the predictive algorithms and what we see from a risk control because you can take all that information now and put it into the systems and so it is an automation but beyond the automation its a mindset to say we’re going to seek out every neuron we got and bring it to bear on the underwriting process unidentified analyst its exciting thank you for the good quarter operator that concludes our questionandanswer session
