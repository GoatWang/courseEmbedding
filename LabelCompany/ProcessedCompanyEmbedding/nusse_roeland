and scholarly interests our laboratory is interested in the growth development and integrity of animal tissues we study multiple different organs trying to identify common principles and we extend these investigations to cancer and injury repair in most organs different cell types are generated by stem cells  cells that also make copies of themselves and thereby maintain the tissue an optimal balance between the number of stem and differentiated cells is essential for the proper function of the organs locallyacting signals are important to maintain this balance in a spatiallyorganized manner and these signals are key to understanding the regulation of growth a common theme linking our work together are wnt signals work from many laboratories including our own has shown that wnt proteins are essential for the control over stem cells how this is achieved is far from clear and is the subject of studies in the lab both in vivo and in cell culture in vivo a particular question we address is how physiological changes such as those occurring during hormonal stimuli injury or programmed tissue degeneration have an impact on the selfrenewal signals and on stem cell biologyin our most recent work we have designed cell fate tracking experiments to study stem cells in vivo we identified wntresponsive stem cells by their expression of axin a common wnt target gene and generated a mouse strain with the creert recombination signal inserted into the axin locus axincre by clonal labeling we showed that single stem cells differentiate into different cell types of the tissues of interest unexpectedly in the liver we found that hepatocytes that reside in the pericentral domain of the liver demonstrate stem cell behavior although these cells are functional hepatocytes they are diploid and thus differ from the mostly polyploid mature hepatocyte population they are active in homeostatic cell replacement adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide the essential source of wnt signals for the hepatocyte stem cells and thereby constitute the liver stem cell niche  courses cell and developmental biologyhumbio a win the biology of stem cellshumbio  spr independent studies

wnt proteins operate as primordial symmetrybreaking signals by virtue of their shortrange nature and their capacity to activate both lineagespecifying and cellpolarizing intracellular signaling

remained an open question by lineage tracing using the wntresponsive gene axin in mice we identify a population of proliferating and selfrenewing cells adjacent to the central vein in the liver lobule these pericentral cells express the early liver progenitor marker tbx are diploid and thereby differ from mature hepatocytes which are mostly polyploid the descendants of pericentral cells differentiate into tbxnegative polyploid hepatocytes and can replace all hepatocytes along the liver lobule during homeostatic renewal adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide wnt signals that maintain the pericentral cells thereby constituting the niche thus we identify a cell population in the liver that subserves homeostatic hepatocyte renewal characterize its anatomical niche and

tissue maintained by stem cells however the identity of the stem cells that maintain the interfollicular epidermis and the source of the signals that control their activity remain unclear using mouse lineage tracing and quantitative clonal analyses we showed that the wnt target gene axin marks interfollicular epidermal stem cells these axinexpressing cells constitute the majority of the basal epidermal layer compete neutrally and require wntβcatenin signaling to proliferate the same cells contribute robustly to wound healing with no requirement for a quiescent stem cell subpopulation by means of doublelabeling rna in situ hybridization in mice we showed that the axinexpressing cells themselves produce wnt signals as well as longrange secreted wnt inhibitors suggesting an autocrine

science habib s j chen b tsai f anastassiadis k meyer t betzig e nusse r     abstract developmental signals such as wnts are often presented to cells in an oriented manner to examine the consequences of local wnt signaling we immobilized wnt proteins on beads and introduced them to embryonic stem cells in culture at the singlecell level the wntbead induced asymmetric distribution of wntβcatenin signaling components oriented the plane of mitotic division and directed asymmetric inheritance of centrosomes before cytokinesis was completed the wntproximal daughter cell expressed high levels of nuclear βcatenin and pluripotency genes whereas the distal daughter cell acquired hallmarks of differentiation we suggest that a spatially restricted wnt signal induces an oriented cell division that generates distinct cell fates at predictable positions relative to the wnt source view details for doi science view details for web of science id  view details for pubmedid  wnt proteins are selfrenewal factors for mammary stem cells and promote their longterm expansion in culture cell stem cell zeng y a nusse r     abstract adult stem cells have the ability to selfrenew and to generate specialized cells selfrenewal is dependent on extrinsic niche factors but few of those signals have been identified in addition stem cells tend to differentiate in the absence of the proper signals and are therefore difficult to maintain in cell culture the mammary gland provides an excellent system to study selfrenewal signals because the organ develops postnatally arises from stem cells and is readily generated from transplanted cells we show here that adult mammary glands contain a wntresponsive cell population that is enriched for stem cells in addition stem cells mutant for the negativefeedback regulator axin and therefore sensitized to wnt signals have a competitive advantage in mammary gland reconstitution assays in cell culture experiments exposure to purified wnt protein clonally expands mammary stem cells for many generations and maintains their ability to generate functional glands in transplantation assays we conclude that wnt proteins serve as ratelimiting

betacatenintcf signaling depending on receptor context plos biology mikels a j nusse r     abstract the wnts comprise a large class of secreted proteins that control essential developmental processes such as embryonic patterning cell growth migration and differentiation in the most wellunderstood canonical wnt signaling pathway wnt binding to frizzled receptors induces betacatenin protein stabilization and entry into the nucleus where it complexes with tcell factorlymphoid enhancer factor transcription factors to affect the transcription of target genes in addition to the canonical pathway evidence for several other wnt signaling pathways has accumulated in particular for wnta which has therefore been classified as a noncanonical wnt family member to study the alternative mechanisms by which wnt proteins signal we purified the wnta protein to homogeneity we find that purified wnta inhibits wnta proteininduced canonical wnt signaling in a dosedependent manner not by influencing betacatenin levels but by downregulating betacatenininduced reporter gene expression the wnta signal is mediated by the orphan tyrosine kinase ror is pertussis toxin insensitive and does not influence cellular calcium levels we show that in addition to its inhibitory function wnta can also activate betacatenin signaling in the presence of the appropriate frizzled receptor frizzled  thus this study shows for the first time that a single wnt ligand can initiate discrete signaling pathways through the activation of two distinct receptors based on these and additional observations we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates wnt signaling output in this model signaling by different wnt family members is not intrinsically regulated by the wnt proteins themselves but by

willert k brown j d danenberg e duncan a w weissman i l reya t yates j r nusse r     abstract wnt signalling is involved in numerous events in animal development including the proliferation of stem cells and the specification of the neural crest wnt proteins are potentially important reagents in expanding specific cell types but in contrast to other developmental signalling molecules such as hedgehog proteins and the bone morphogenetic proteins wnt proteins have never been isolated in an active form although wnt proteins are secreted from cells secretion is usually inefficient and previous attempts to characterize wnt proteins have been hampered by their high degree of insolubility here we have isolated active wnt molecules including the product of the mouse wnta gene by mass spectrometry we found the proteins to be palmitoylated on a conserved cysteine enzymatic removal of the palmitate or sitedirected and natural mutations of the modified cysteine result in loss of activity and indicate that the lipid is important for signalling the purified wnta protein induces selfrenewal of haematopoietic stem cells signifying its potential use in tissue engineering view

leads to heart failure in contrast the neonatal mammalian heart reacts to injury by the development of transient fibrotic tissue that is eventually replaced by regenerated cardiomyocytes how fibrosis occurs in the neonatal mammalian heart remains unknown to start elucidating the molecular underpinnings of neonatal cardiac fibrosis we investigated wnt signaling in the neonatal heart after cryoinjuryusing expression of the wnt target gene axin as an indicator of wntβcatenin signaling activation we discovered that epicardial cells in the ventricles are responsive to wnt in the uninjured neonatal heart lineagetracing studies of these wntresponsive epicardial cells showed that they undergo epithelialtomesenchymal transition and infiltrate into the subepicardial space and exhibit fibroblast phenotypes after injury in addition we showed thatsimilar to adult ischemic injuryneonatal cryoinjury results in activation of wnt signaling in cardiac fibroblasts near injured areas furthermore through in situ hybridization of all  wnt ligands in injured neonatal hearts we observed upregulation of wnt ligands wntb wnta and wnta that had not been implicated in the adult cardiac

is unclear axin is a direct transcriptional target of βcatenin recent studies have shown that axinexpressing cells have stemprogenitor cell properties in a variety of mouse tissues here we genetically labeled axinexpressing cells at various time points and tracked their cellular behavior at different developmental and mature stages we found that prostatic axinexpressing cells mainly express luminal epithelial cell markers and are able to expand luminal cell lineages during prostatic development and maturation they can also survive androgen withdrawal and regenerate prostatic luminal epithelial cells following androgen replacement deletion of βcatenin or expression of stabilized βcatenin in these axinexpressing cells results in abnormal development or oncogenic transformation respectively our study uncovers a critical role of wntβcateninresponsive cells in prostatic development and regeneration and that dysregulation of wntβcatenin signaling in these cells contributes to prostatic

number of multiple bone and cartilage structures during development bmp mutations also delay healing of rib fractures in adult mutants suggesting that the same signals used to pattern embryonic bone and cartilage are also reused during skeletal regeneration and repair despite intense interest in bmps as agents for stimulating bone formation in clinical applications little is known about the regulatory elements that control developmental or injuryinduced bmp expression to compare the dna sequences that activate gene expression during embryonic bone formation and following acute injuries in adult animals we assayed regions surrounding the bmp gene for their ability to stimulate lacz reporter gene expression in transgenic mice multiple genomic fragments distributed across the bmp locus collectively coordinate expression in discrete anatomic domains during normal development including in embryonic ribs in contrast a distinct regulatory region activated expression following rib fracture in adult animals the same injury control region triggered gene expression in mesenchymal cells following tibia fracture in migrating keratinocytes following dorsal skin wounding and in

significant interest in understanding their contribution to tissue homeostasis at both the cellular and molecular level wntβcatenin signaling is crucial for development of the central nervous system and has been implicated in stem cell maintenance in multiple tissues based on this we hypothesized that the wnt pathway likely controls neural stem cell maintenance and differentiation along the entire developmental continuum to test this we performed lineage tracing experiments using the recently developed tamoxifeninducible cre at axin mouse strain to follow the developmental fate of wntβcateninresponsive cells in both the embryonic and postnatal mouse brain from as early as embryonic day  onwards axin cells can give rise to spatially and functionally restricted populations of adult neural stem cells in the subventricular zone similarly progeny from axin cells labeled from e contribute to both the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus labeling in the

wnt signaling in mouse mammary development and tumorigenesis has been heavily studied and characterized but its role in human breast cancer remains elusive although wnt inhibitors are in early clinical development it is unclear whether they will be of therapeutic benefit to breast cancer patients and subsequently to which ones to address this we generated a panel of wnt reporting human breast cancer cell lines and identified a previously unrecognized enrichment for the ability to respond to wnt in the basal b or claudinlow subtype which has a poor prognosis and no available targeted therapies by coinjecting wnta expressing human mammary fibroblasts with human breast cancer cell lines into mouse mammary fat pads we showed that elevated paracrine wnt signaling was correlated with accelerated tumor growth using this heterotypic system and a dual lentiviral reporter system that enables simultaneous realtime measurement of both wntresponsive cells and bulk tumor cells we analyzed the outcome of elevated wnt signaling in patientderived xenograft pdx models interestingly the pdx models exhibited responses not observed in the cell lines analyzed exogenous wnta promoted tumor growth in one human epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressing pdx line but inhibited growth in a second pdx line obtained from a patient with triplenegative breast cancer tumor suppression was

respectively on differentiation the wnthigh hescs predominantly form endodermal and cardiac cells whereas the wntlow hescs generate primarily neuroectodermal cells thus heterogeneity with respect to

developmental biology part of the answer may lie in the high inherent genetic complexity of these signaling cascades as observed for the wntpathway the mammalian genome encodes multiple wnt proteins and receptors each of which show dynamic and tightly controlled expression patterns in the embryo yet how these components interact in the context of the whole organism remains unknown here we report the generation of a novel inducible transgenic mouse model that allows spatiotemporal control over the expression of wnta a protein implicated in many developmental processes and multiple wntsignaling responses we show that ectopic wnta expression from e onwards results in a variety of developmental defects including loss of hair follicles and reduced bone formation in the skull moreover we find that wnta can have dual signaling activities during mouse embryonic development specifically wnta is capable of both inducing and repressing βcatenintcf signaling in vivo depending on the time and site of expression and the receptors expressed by receiving cells these experiments show for the first time that a single mammalian wnt protein can have multiple signaling activities in vivo thereby

and genes encoding wntsignaling factors are expressed in the pancreas however it is unclear whether wnt signaling regulates pancreatic islet proliferation and differentiation here we provide evidence that wnt signaling stimulates islet beta cell proliferation the addition of purified wnta protein to cultured beta cells or islets promoted expression of pitx a direct target of wnt signaling and

and cadherinmediated cellcell adhesion raising the possibility that wg signaling affects cell adhesion here we use a tissue culture system that allows conditional activation of the wingless signaling pathway and modulation of ecadherin expression levels we show that activation of the wingless signaling pathway leads to the accumulation of hypophosphorylated armadillo in the cytoplasm and in

increased spreading of the cells on the substratum after the initial loss of ecadherin from the cell surface ecadherin gene expression is increased by wingless we suggest that wingless signaling

the basis of hereditary hair loss diseases and the origin of folliclebased tumors we demonstrate that the protooncogene wnt which encodes a secreted paracrine signaling molecule is expressed in developing and mature hair follicles and that its overexpression in transgenic mouse skin causes a shorthair phenotype due to altered differentiation of hair shaft precursor cells and cyclical balding

other cell types of the testis are unaffected dwnt is expressed in somatic cells of the gonad throughout development implicating it as a signal that can influence pigment cell fate directly indeed the ectopic expression of dwnt in females results in the appearance of malespecific pigment cells in otherwise morphologically normal ovaries thus the presence of pigment cells is a sexually dimorphic

intercellular signaling during several stages of vertebrate development this family includes wnt and wnt both discovered as activated oncogenes in mouse mammary tumors here we describe the molecular cloning of an additional member of the wnt family called wnta and the spatial and temporal expression pattern of this gene as well as that of its close relative wnt the putative amino acid sequences of both proteins are almost  identical but in situ hybridization to mouse embryo sections showed highly restricted patterns of expression of wnt and wnta largely in separate areas in the developing nervous system in the spinal cord wnt was expressed at low levels in the alar laminae and in the ventral horns whereas wnta expression was confined to the roof plate in the developing brain wnt was expressed broadly across the dorsal portion of the neural tube with a rostral boundary of expression at the diencephalon in contrast wnta was expressed in a narrow region very close to the midline expression extended into the bifurcating telencephalon in a highly localized fashion both wnt and wnta were expressed in the ectoderm and wnta was also expressed in the periumbilical mesenchyme characteristic expression patterns of these two closely related genes suggest that wnt and wnta play distinct roles in cellcell signaling during morphogenesis of the developing neural tube view

we have asked whether oncogenesis by the mouse mammary tumor virus mmtv a slowly oncogenic retrovirus involves integration of viral dna within a certain region of the host genome we first identified a

to retrieve  kb of the uninterrupted locus termed mmtv int from a bacteriophage library of normal mouse dna hybridization with subcloned dna fragments of mmtv int detected abnormal restriction fragments in digests of dna from  of  ch mammary tumors the rearrangements all appeared to be due to the insertion of an mmtv provirus and the integration sites were located in at least five clusters over a total distance of  kb a polyadenylated  kb rna species transcribed from int was found in the few tumors tested but not in lactating mammary glands from ch mice of  tested viral oncogenes none

understanding the regulation of growth hepatocyte stem cells from wang et al  a common theme linking our work together are wnt signals  work from many laboratories including our own has shown that wnt proteins are essential for the control over stem cells how this is achieved is far from clear and is the subject of studies in the lab both in vivo and in cell culture  in vivo a particular question we address is how physiological changes such as those occurring during hormonal stimuli injury or programmed tissue degeneration have an impact on the selfrenewal signals and on stem cell biology  in recent work we have described a novel population of wntresponsive cells in the liver that act as hepatocyte stem cells these cells are present pericentrally in the liver lobule express the wnt target gene axin and can be followed over time to contribute to the entire hepatocyte population in the lobule  importantly these cells are diploid unlike the mostly polyploid mature hepatocytes and are not

follow as early as his high school years in amsterdam when a particularly engaging teacher introduced him to the still young field of molecular biology nusse knew that was the career for him research experience in labs at the university of amsterdam and the netherlands cancer institute when he was an undergraduate further whet his appetite his time in the university of amsterdam lab of piet borst made a particularly strong impression using what todays scientists might consider primitive tools the lab made groundbreaking discoveries such as the discovery of introns in genes this was all before recombinant dna but you could still smell the excitement in the field said nusse there nusse worked with a postdoctoral fellow who also went on to make his mark richard flavell flavell yale university school of medicine is also currently an hhmi investigator in the mids nusse returned to both the university of amsterdam and the netherlands cancer institute to conduct his doctoral studies at that time researchers were homing in on retroviruses as a cause of cancer and nusse focused his studies on a virus known to cause mammary tumors in mice nusse next joined harold varmuss lab at the university of california san francisco as a postdoctoral fellow bringing him into the forefront of cancer research in one of the mostheralded labs in the world varmus was among the leading proponents of retroviruses as a tumorcausing mechanism and together with colleague j michael bishop he had shown that a virus that causes tumors in chickens does so by altering the activity of a gene already present in normal chicken dna i was very inspired by what varmus was doing said nusse it was in varmuss lab in  that nusse discovered the wnt gene which was activated in breast cancer in the mouse it later turned out to be the first member of the wnt gene family which now has  members it was a lucky find he says as it has been determined by his lab that wnt plays important roles in embryonic development cell differentiation and tissue regeneration subsequent work in many labs has shown that wnt signaling is implicated in many forms of human cancer as well we cloned this gene and at the time we had no clue that it would turn out to be so important he said at the netherlands cancer institute where he returned as a staff scientist after his work in the varmus lab nusse and his colleagues discovered that fruit flies possess a gene with similar origins and functions to the gene they had found in mice by linking the fruit fly gene to the gene they had found in mice nusse showed that there was a genetic connection between normal development and cancer in  nusse returned to the bay area taking a position in the department of developmental biology at stanford university and becoming an hhmi investigator being able to study the gene in drosophila expanded the kinds of studies that nusse and his colleagues at stanford could undertake thanks to the genetic tools and extensive data available to fruit fly geneticists in  nusse working with another hhmi investigator jeremy nathans johns hopkins university school of medicine identified frizzleds as receptors for wingless and other wnt genes nusses lab has also found a role for a wnt gene in immunity in the fruit fly since his initial discovery nusse and his lab have continued to focus on wnt signaling signaling factors such as wnt help direct embryonic cells into their specialized roles and in adults wnt helps control the pace of stem cell division the bottom line is almost every cell in the embryo may become a target of wnt signaling said nusse by studying the cells that give rise to limbs in the mouse embryo nusse found that wnt encourages cells to keep dividing while actively preventing them from differentiating into more mature cell types less is known about wnts role in adult tissue it is thought that the gene may also act in this dual fashion especially in response to damage he said nusses lab has identified wnt proteins and wnt signaling in the brains of mice where novel neurons have formed suggesting a contribution to neurogenesis the proteins and signaling have also been found in the bone marrow accompanying the formation of new blood cells in a series of experiments in the adult mouse nusse and his colleagues used naphthalene to selectively destroy clara cells which are known to be important for detoxification of lung cells as the cells regenerated the researchers were able to observe and elucidate the wnt mechanism in clara cell regeneration two wnt genes were expressed after the injury and only when the tissue was impaired that suggests that injured clara cells—and possibly other types of cells though it is not currently known—can send signals that activate wnt transcription according to nusse nusse had longsuspected that wnt proteins could be a powerful tool for manipulating stem cells in vitro but the ability to harness that power eluded nusse for a quartercentury—until  when he discovered how to purify the proteins in an active form his lab is now using the purified proteins as growth factors to directly manipulate stem cells im very excited about the work were doing with neural stem cells said nusse some day we may see that the mechanisms were working on will help cure parkinsons disease show more articles  newshhmi scientists

nusse was awarded the  breakthrough prize in life sciences for his contributions to the understanding a signaling molecule called wnt stanford medicine news center  december th   by krista conger roeland nusse phd the virginia and daniel k ludwig professor in cancer research and a howard hughes medical institute investigator was honored this evening with a  breakthrough prize in life sciences nusse was awarded the  million prize for his contributions to the understanding of how a signaling molecule called wnt affects normal development cancer and the functions of adult stem cells in many tissues throughout the body “this is a complete surprise” said nusse who is professor and chair of developmental biology “my gratitude goes out to many people — my past and present postdoctoral scholars and graduate students and my former mentors have all contributed to the success of my research the research and collaborative environment at stanford and the longterm support from the howard hughes medical institute have also been fantastic i see this award as a great honor for the entire community” the breakthrough prizes initiated in  honor paradigmshifting research and discovery in the fields of life sciences fundamental physics and mathematics in total about  million was awarded this year  a blacktie redcarpet ceremony for the presentation of the prizes was held at the nasa ames research center in mountain view the event was hosted by actor morgan freeman the grammy awardwinning pop star alicia keys provided entertainment “roel’s pioneering work has provided deep insights into an essential molecular signaling pathway that controls normal embryonic development and adult tissue repair and that contributes to cancer when it is not properly regulated  his work has served as a model for many others in our field and accelerated further studies of these critical processes” said stanford president marc tessierlavigne phd “we are grateful that the breakthrough prize recognizes the work of scientific leaders who are inspiring others to pursue discovery that is truly transformative benefiting all of humanity” nusse’s interest in wnt began in the s as a postdoctoral scholar in the laboratory of harold varmus md who was then on the faculty of ucsan francisco in  nusse discovered the wnt gene which was abnormally activated in a mouse model of breast cancer he subsequently discovered that members of the wnt family of proteins also play critical roles in embryonic development cell differentiation and tissue regeneration “roel has devoted his career to identifying one of the major signaling molecules in embryonic development and clarifying its role in cancer development and in tissue regeneration” said lloyd minor md dean of the school of medicine “the importance of wnt signaling in these processes cannot be overestimated his work has been the foundation of much of modern developmental biology and we are very proud of his contributions” nusse’s more recent work has focused on understanding how wnt family members control the function of adult stem cells in response to injury or disease in  he identified the cellsurface receptor to which wnt proteins bind to control cells’ functions and in  he was the first to purify wnt proteins — an essential step to understanding how they work at a molecular level  “my work has shifted significantly over the years due to the influence of my stanford colleagues although it has always been focused on wnt” said nusse “when i arrived at stanford i was studying the involvement of the wnt proteins in mouse development and cancer i then switched to fruit flies and then to the study of adult stem cells stanford has supported me during this evolution of my research career” nusse’s lab is currently devoted to understanding how wnt signaling affects the function of adult stem cells in the liver to help the organ heal after injury as well as what role wnt signaling might play in the development of liver cancer “the breakthrough prizes are a sign of the times” said nusse “together with the recently announced chan zuckerberg initiative they show how the wealth of silicon valley is now making an impact not just in the field of computer science but also in biomedical fields this is very exciting”  nusse is a member of the ludwig center for cancer stem cell research and medicine at stanford of the stanford cancer institute and of the stanford institute for stem cell biology and regenerative medicine he was awarded the peter debye prize from the university of maastricht in  he is a member of the us national academy of sciences the european molecular biology organization and the royal dutch academy of sciences he is also a fellow of the american academy of arts and sciences seven  million breakthrough prizes — five in the life sciences one in fundamental physics and one in mathematics — were awarded to  recipients in addition a special breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to the more than  researchers who proved the existence of gravitational waves in february of    probing for dark matter in addition three  new horizons in physics prizes were awarded at the ceremony peter graham phd an assistant professor of physics at stanford shared one of them with asimina arvanitaki of the perimeter institute in ontario canada and surjeet rajendran of the university of californiaberkeley for “pioneering a wide range of new experimental probes of fundamental physics” graham earned a phd at stanford and completed postdoctoral studies at the stanford institute for theoretical physics before joining the stanford faculty in  in  he received an early career award from the department of energy graham has developed new experiments to detect particles known as dark matter which physicists have reason to believe exist but haven’t yet been able to detect physicists have theorized about what dark matter might be and based on that work have designed experiments to detect those theorized particles however those experiments would miss one possible variant of what dark matter might be known as an axion “it was a scary scenario that this might be what dark matter is and our current experiments wouldn’t detect it” graham said graham designed new experimental approaches that would detect axions if they turn out to be what make up dark matter “this prize is a huge honor” graham said “it’s great to get recognition from the community for this new direction it will really help this emerging field”  three  new horizons in mathematics prizes were also presented at the breakthrough prize ceremony  in addition two teenagers — one from peru and one from singapore — each won the  breakthrough junior challenge they will each receive  in educational prizes the breakthrough prizes are funded by grants from the brin wojcicki foundation established by google founder sergey brin and andme founder anne wojcicki mark zuckerbergs fund at the silicon valley community foundation alibaba founder jack ma’s foundation and dst global founder yuri milner’s foundation recipients are chosen by committees comprised of prior prizewinners amy adams director for
