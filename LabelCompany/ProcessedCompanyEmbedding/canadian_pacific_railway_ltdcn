momentum should investors give cp rail a look or should they continue to stick with cn rail which is considered north america’s most efficient railroad many investors have scratched cp rail off their radars following hunter e harrison’s departure cp rail simply isn’t the highgrowth company it used to be the lowhanging fruit in the form of costcutting opportunities has been picked most of the easier cuts have already been implemented and further operational efficiency initiatives are going to take a lot more effort from here simply put investors shouldn’t expect the huge returns they received during the years before the  slump but that doesn’t mean cp rail isn’t worthy of your investment dollars especially if the price is right in general the rails are places where you want to be right now they’re profitable businesses with huge moats and as commodity prices improve all rails will be poised to benefit slowed revenue a cause for concern one thing that’s alarming is the fact that the cp rail’s revenue growth has halted  keith creel ceo of cp rail said that the company’s focus “…is topline growth and that’s exactly what my mandate is for my team” the management team is expanding its sales staff with the hopes that the company can attract more business and improve its relationship with customers cp rail is undergoing a major transformation in the postharrison era the company will still be investing to ensure operations are running smoothly but the real upside is going to come from cp rail’s ability to retain existing customers and attract new ones bottom line going forward the company is expected to continue to invest in customersatisfaction initiatives but ultimately it’s going to be very hard to win customers from cn rail it has a larger network which connects all three major north american coasts there’s a huge cloud of uncertainty following cp rail right now but one thing is certain returns are going to be modest from here and investors expecting the same magnitude of returns during the harrison era should look elsewhere to avoid disappointment the stock of cp rail trades at a  pricetoearnings multiple which is lower than the company’s fiveyear historical average pricetoearnings of  although cheaper than cn rail’s  pricetoearnings multiple i think investors would be far better off by paying a slightly higher price for the higherquality cn rail which is well positioned to deliver many consistent dividend increases in the coming years stay smart stay hungry stay foolish  massive dividend stock to buy today  yield  the

weight of the freight cars their contents and any inactive locomotives an increase in gtms indicates additional workload gtms for the second quarter of  were  million an increase of  compared with  million in the same period of  this increase was primarily due to increased volumes of canadian grain frac sand canadian coal export potash and crude train miles increased by  for the second quarter of  compared to the same period of  this reflects the impact of higher volumes partly offset by continuous improvements in train weights the average train weight is defined as the average gross weight of cp trains both loaded and empty this excludes trains in shorthaul service work trains used to move cps track equipment and materials and the haulage of other railways trains on cps network average train weight increased by  for the second quarter of  compared to the same period of  this increase was due to continuous improvements in bulk train weights and higher bulk frac sand and crude volumes

measure average train length decreased by  for the second quarter of  compared to the same period of  this is a result of shipping proportionately more bulk and frac sand traffic compared to the same period in  the average terminal dwell is defined as the average time a freight car resides within terminal boundaries expressed in hours the timing starts with a train arriving in the terminal a

ottawa valley and georgian bay area lines built earlier fulfilling a promise extended to british columbia when it entered confederation in  it was canadas first transcontinental railway but no longer reaches the atlantic coast primarily a freight railway the cpr was for decades the only practical means of longdistance passenger transport in most regions of canada and was instrumental in the

combination of reasons by the conservative government of prime minister sir john a macdonald st canadian ministry he was helped by sir alexander tilloch galt who was the owner of the north western coal and navigation company his company went through several name changes during the process of the construction of the railway british columbia a fourmonth sea voyage away from the east coast had insisted upon a land transport link to the east as a condition for joining confederation initially requesting a wagon road the government however proposed to build a railway linking the pacific province to the eastern provinces within  years of  july  macdonald saw it as essential to the creation of a unified canadian nation that would stretch across the continent moreover manufacturing interests in quebec and ontario wanted access to raw materials and markets in western canadacitation needed sir john a macdonald the first obstacle to its construction was political the logical route went through the american midwest and the city of chicago illinois in addition to this was the difficulty of building a railroad through the canadian rockies an entirely canadian route would require crossing  km  mi of rugged terrain across the barren canadian shield and muskeg of northern ontario to ensure this routing the government offered huge incentives including vast grants of land in the westcitation needed in  sir john a macdonald and other highranking politicians bribed in the pacific scandal granted federal contracts to hugh allans canada pacific railway company which was unrelated to the current company rather than to david lewis macphersons interocean railway company which was thought to have connections to the american northern pacific railway company because of this scandal the conservative party was removed from office in  the new liberal prime minister alexander mackenzie ordered construction of segments of the railway as a public enterprise under the supervision of the department of public works led by sandford fleming surveying was carried out during the first years of a number of alternative routes in this virgin territory followed by construction of a telegraph along the lines that had been agreed upon the thunder bay section linking lake superior to winnipeg was commenced in  by  around  kilometres  mi was nearly complete mainly across the troublesome canadian shield terrain with trains running on only  kilometres  mi of track cpr locomotive and employees with macdonalds return to power on  october  a more aggressive construction policy was adopted macdonald confirmed that port moody would be the terminus of the transcontinental railway and announced that the railway would follow the fraser and thompson rivers between port moody and kamloops in  the federal government floated bonds in london and called for tenders to construct the  km  mi section of the railway from yale british columbia to savonas ferry on kamloops lake the contract was awarded to andrew onderdonk whose men started work on  may  after the completion of that section onderdonk received contracts to build between yale and port moody and between savonas ferry and eagle passcitation needed on  october  a new syndicate unrelated to hugh allans signed a contract with the macdonald government and fleming was dismissed they agreed to build the railway in exchange for  million approximately  million in modern canadian dollars in credit from the canadian government and a grant of  million acres  km of land the government transferred to the new company those sections of the railway it had constructed under government ownership on which it had already spent at least  million but its estimates of the cost of the rocky mountain section alone was over  million the government also defrayed surveying costs and exempted the railway from property taxes for  years the montrealbased syndicate officially comprised five men george stephen james j hill duncan mcintyre richard b angus and john stewart kennedy donald a smith and norman kittson were unofficial silent partners with a significant financial interest on  february  legislation confirming the contract received royal assent and the canadian pacific railway company was formally incorporated the next day critics claimed that the government gave too large a subsidy for the proposed project but this was to incorporate uncertainties of risk and irreversibility of insurance the large subsidy also needed to compensate the cpr for not constructing the line in the future but rather right away even though demand would not cover operational costs building the railway –edit canadian pacific railway crew laying tracks at lower fraser valley  building the railway took over four years the canadian pacific railway began its westward expansion from bonfield ontario previously called callander station where the first spike was driven into a sunken railway tie bonfield was inducted into canadian railway hall of fame in  as the cpr first spike location that was the point where the canada central railway extension ended the ccr was owned by duncan mcintyre who amalgamated it with the cpr and became one of the handful of officers of the newly formed cpr the ccr started in brockville and extended to pembroke it then followed a westward route along the ottawa river passing through places like cobden deuxrivières and eventually to mattawa at the confluence of the mattawa and ottawa rivers it then proceeded crosscountry towards its final destination of bonfield duncan mcintyre and his contractor james worthington piloted the cpr expansion worthington continued on as the construction superintendent for the cpr past bonfield he remained with the cpr for about a year after which he left the company mcintyre was uncle to john ferguson who staked out future north bay and who became the towns wealthiest inhabitant and mayor for four successive terms unidentified engineers of the canadian pacific railway survey  it was presumed that the railway would travel through the rich fertile belt of the north saskatchewan river valley and cross the rocky mountains via the yellowhead pass a route suggested by sir sandford fleming based on a decade of work however the cpr quickly discarded this plan in favour of a more southerly route across the arid pallisers triangle in saskatchewan and via kicking horse pass and down the field hill to the rocky mountain trench this route was more direct and closer to the canada–us border making it easier for the cpr to keep american railways from encroaching on the canadian market however this route also had several disadvantages one was that the cpr would need to find a route through the selkirk mountains in british columbia while at the time it was not known whether a route even existed the job of finding a pass was assigned to a surveyor named major albert bowman rogers the cpr promised him a cheque for  and that the pass would be named in his honour rogers became obsessed with finding the pass that would immortalize his name he discovered the pass in april  and true to its word the cpr named it rogers pass and gave him the cheque however he at first refused to cash it preferring to frame it saying he did not do it for the money he later agreed to cash it with the promise of an engraved watchcitation needed another obstacle was that the proposed route crossed land in alberta that was controlled by the blackfoot first nation this difficulty was overcome when a missionary priest albert lacombe persuaded the blackfoot chief crowfoot that construction of the railway was inevitable in return for his assent crowfoot was famously rewarded with a lifetime pass to ride the cpr a more lasting consequence of the choice of route was that unlike the one proposed by fleming the land surrounding the railway often proved too arid for successful agriculture the cpr may have placed too much reliance on a report from naturalist john macoun who had crossed the prairies at a time of very high rainfall and had reported that the area was fertile the greatest disadvantage of the route was in kicking horse pass at the albertabritish columbia border on the continental divide in the first  km  mi west of the  metres  feet high summit the kicking horse river drops  metres  feet the steep drop would force the cashstrapped cpr to build a  km  mi long stretch of track with a very steep ½ percent gradient once it reached the pass in  this was over four times the maximum gradient recommended for railways of this era and even modern railways rarely exceed a twopercent gradient however this route was far more direct than one through the yellowhead pass and saved hours for both passengers and freight this section of track was the cprs big hill safety switches were installed at several points the speed limit for descending trains was set at  km per hour  mph and special locomotives were ordered despite these measures several serious runaways still occurred including the first locomotive which belonged to the contractors to descend the line cpr officials insisted that this was a temporary expediency but this state of affairs would last for  years until the completion of the spiral tunnels in the early th centurycitation needed sir william cornelius van horne in  construction progressed at a pace too slow for the railways officials who in  hired the renowned railway executive william cornelius van horne to oversee construction with the inducement of a generous salary and the intriguing challenge of handling such a difficult railway project van horne stated that he would have  km  mi of main line built in  floods delayed the start of the construction season but over  km  mi of main line as well as sidings and branch lines were built that year the thunder bay branch west from fort william was completed in june  by the department of railways and canals and turned over to the company in may  permitting allcanadian lake and railway traffic from eastern canada to winnipeg for the first time in canadas history by the end of  the railway had reached the rocky mountains just eight kilometres five miles east of kicking horse pass the construction seasons of  and  would be spent in the mountains of british columbia and on the north shore of lake superior cpr trestle bridge many thousands of navvies worked on the railway many were european immigrants in british columbia government contractors hired workers from china known as coolies a navvy received between  and  per day but had to pay for his own food clothing transport to the job site mail and medical care after ½ months of hard labour they could net as little as  chinese labourers in british columbia made only between  cents and  a day paid in rice mats and not including expenses leaving barely anything to send home they did the most dangerous construction jobs such as working with explosives to clear tunnels through rock the families of the chinese who were killed received no compensation or even notification of loss of life many of the men who survived did not have enough money to return to their families in china although chinese labour contractors had promised that as part of their responsibilities many spent years in isolated and often poor conditions yet the chinese were hard working and played a key role in building the western stretch of the railway even some boys as young as twelve years old served as teaboys in  the canadian government issued a formal apology to the chinese population in canada for their treatment both during and following the construction of the cpr by  railway construction was progressing rapidly but the cpr was in danger of running out of funds in response on  january  the government passed the railway relief bill providing a further  million in loans to the cpr the bill received royal assent on  march  donald smith later known as lord strathcona drives the last spike of the canadian pacific railway at craigellachie  november  completion of the transcontinental railway was a condition of bcs entry into confederation in march  the northwest rebellion broke out in the district of saskatchewan van horne in ottawa at the time suggested to the government that the cpr could transport troops to quappelle saskatchewan assiniboia in  days some sections of track were incomplete or had not been used before but the trip to winnipeg was made in nine days and the rebellion quickly suppressed perhaps because the government was grateful for this service they subsequently reorganized the cprs debt and provided a further  million loan this money was desperately needed by the cpr however this government loan later became controversial even with van hornes support with moving troops to quappelle the government still delayed in giving its support to cpr this was due to sir john a macdonald putting pressure on george stephen for additional benefits stephen himself later did admit to spending  million between  and  to ensure government support this money went to buying a £ necklace for lady macdonald and numerous other bonifications to government members telegram to prime minister john a macdonald announcing the completion of the canadian pacific railway november   on  november  the last spike was driven at craigellachie british columbia making good on the original promise four days earlier the last spike of the lake superior section was driven in just west of jackfish ontario while the railway was completed four years after the original  deadline it was completed more than five years ahead of the new date of  that macdonald gave in  the successful construction of such a massive project although troubled by delays and scandal was considered an impressive feat of engineering and political will for a country with such a small population limited capital and difficult terrain it was by far the longest railway ever constructed at the time it had taken  men and  horses to construct the lake section alone meanwhile in eastern canada the cpr had created a network of lines reaching from quebec city to st thomas ontario by  mainly by buying the quebec montreal ottawa  occidental railway from the quebec government and had launched a fleet of great lakes ships to link its terminals the cpr had effected purchases and longterm leases of several railways through an associated railway company the ontario and quebec railway oq the oq built a line between perth ontario and toronto completed on  may  to connect these acquisitions the cpr obtained a year lease on the oq on  january  in  it acquired a minority interest in the toronto hamilton and buffalo railway giving it a link to new york and the northeast united states –edit the last spike in the cpr was driven on  november  by one of its directors donald smith but so many costcutting shortcuts were taken in constructing the railway that regular transcontinental service could not start for another seven months while work was done to improve the railways condition part of this was because of snow in the mountains and lack of snowsheds to keep the line open however had these shortcuts not been taken it is conceivable that the cpr might have had to default financially leaving the railway unfinishedcitation needed the first transcontinental passenger train departed from montreals dalhousie station located at berri street and notre dame street at  pm on  june  and arrived at port moody at noon on  july  this train consisted of two baggage cars a mail car one secondclass coach two immigrant sleepers two firstclass coaches two sleeping cars and a diner several dining cars were used throughout the journey as they were removed from the train during the night with another one added the next morningcitation needed first transcontinental train arrives in port arthur on  june  by that time however the cpr had decided to move its western terminus from port moody to granville which was renamed vancouver later that year the first official train destined for vancouver arrived on  may  although the line had already been in use for three months the cpr quickly became profitable and all loans from the federal government were repaid years ahead of time in  a branch line was opened between sudbury and sault ste marie where the cpr connected with the american railway system and its own steamships that same year work was started on a line from london ontario to the canada–us border at windsor ontario that line opened on  june  the cpr also leased the new brunswick railway in  for  years and built the international railway of maine connecting montreal with saint john new brunswick in  the connection with saint john on the atlantic coast made the cpr the first truly transcontinental railway company in canada and permitted transatlantic cargo and passenger services to continue yearround when sea ice in the gulf of st lawrence closed the port of montreal during the winter months by  competition with the great northern railway for traffic in southern british columbia forced the cpr to construct a second line across the province south of the original line van horne now president of the cpr asked for government aid and the government agreed to provide around  million to construct a railway from lethbridge alberta through crowsnest pass to the south shore of kootenay lake in exchange for the cpr agreeing to reduce freight rates in perpetuity for key commodities shipped in western canadacitation needed the controversial crowsnest pass agreement effectively locked the eastbound rate on grain products and westbound rates on certain settlers effects at the  level although temporarily suspended during the first world war it was not until  that the crow rate was permanently replaced by the western grain transportation act which allowed for the gradual increase of grain shipping prices the crowsnest pass line opened on  june  and followed a complicated route through the maze of valleys and passes in southern british columbia rejoining the original mainline at hope after crossing the cascade mountains via coquihalla pass the southern mainline generally known as the kettle valley railway in british columbia was built in response to the booming mining and smelting economy in southern british columbia and the tendency of the local geography to encourage and enable easier access from neighbouring us states than from vancouver or the rest of canada which was viewed to be as much of a threat to national security as it was to the provinces control of its own resources the local passenger service was rerouted to this new southerly line which connected numerous emergent small cities across the region independent railways and subsidiaries that were eventually merged into the cpr in connection with this route were the shuswap and okanagan railway the kaslo and slocan railway the columbia and kootenay railway the columbia and western railway and various others the cpr and the settlement of western canadaedit one of the cprs land offerings  practically speaking the cpr had built a railway that operated mostly in the wilderness the usefulness of the prairies was questionable in the minds of many the thinking prevailed that the prairies had great potential under the initial contract with the canadian government to build the railway the cpr was granted  million acres  km proving already to be a very resourceful organization canadian pacific began an intense campaign to bring immigrants to canada canadian pacific agents operated in many overseas locations immigrants were often sold a package that included passage on a cp ship travel on a cp train and land sold by the cp railway land was priced at  an acre and up but required cultivation to transport immigrants canadian pacific developed a fleet of over a thousand colonist

during the first decade of the th century the cpr continued to build more lines in  the cpr opened a line connecting toronto with sudbury previously westbound traffic originating in southern ontario took a circuitous route through eastern ontario several operational improvements were also made to the railway in western canada in  the cpr completed two significant engineering accomplishments the most significant was the replacement of the big hill which had become a major bottleneck in the cprs main line with the spiral tunnels reducing the grade to  percent from  percent the spiral tunnels opened in august in april  the cpr started work to replace the old calgaryedmonton rail bridge across the red deer river with a new standard steel bridge that was completed by march  lethbridge

the spanish river bridge at nairn ontario near sudbury killing at least  the cpr acquired several smaller railways via longterm leases in  on  january  the cpr acquired the dominion atlantic railway a railway that ran in western nova scotia this acquisition gave the cpr a connection to halifax a significant port on the atlantic ocean the dominion atlantic was isolated from the rest of the cpr network and used the cnr to facilitate interchange the dar also operated ferry services across the bay of fundy for passengers and cargo but not rail cars from the port of digby nova scotia to the cpr at saint john new brunswick dar steamships also provided connections for passengers and cargo between yarmouth boston and new york on  july  the cpr acquired the esquimalt and nanaimo railway a railway on vancouver island that connected to the cpr using a railcar ferry the cpr acquired the quebec central railway on  december  during the late th century the railway undertook an ambitious programme of hotel construction building glacier house in glacier national park mount stephen house at field british columbia the château frontenac in quebec city and the banff springs hotel by then

climbing on boxcars as part of the ontoottawa trek  the great depression which lasted from  until  hit many companies heavily while the cpr was affected it was not affected to the extent of its rival cnr because it unlike the cnr was debtfree the cpr scaled back on some of its passenger and freight services and stopped issuing dividends to its shareholders after  hard times led to the creation of new political parties such as the social credit movement and the cooperative commonwealth federation as well as popular protest in the form of the ontoottawa trek one highlight of the late s both for the railway and for canada was the visit of king george vi and queen elizabeth during their  royal tour of canada the first time that the reigning monarch had visited the country the cpr and the cnr shared the honours of pulling the royal train across the country with the cpr undertaking the westbound journey from quebec city to vancouver later that year the second world war began as it had done

chicagos metra system sleeping dining and parlour car departmentedit sleeping cars were operated by a separate department of the railway that included the dining and parlour cars and aptly named as the sleeping dining and parlour car department the cpr decided from the very beginning that it would operate its own sleeping cars unlike railways in the united states that depended upon independent companies that specialized in providing cars and porters including building the cars themselves pullman was long a famous name in this regard its pullman porters were legendary other early companies included the wagner palace car company biggersized berths and more comfortable surroundings were built by order of the cprs general manager william van horne who was a large man himself providing and operating their own cars allowed better control of the service provided as well as keeping all of the revenue received although profit was never a direct result of providing food to passengers rather it was the realization that those who could afford to travel great distances expected such facilities and their favourable opinion would bode well to attracting others to canada and the cprs trains expressedit w c van horne decided from the very beginning that the cpr would retain as much revenue from its various operations as it could this translated into keeping express telegraph sleeping car and other lines of business for themselves creating separate departments or companies as necessary this was necessary as the fledgling railway would need all the income it could get and in addition he saw some of these ancillary operations such as express and telegraph as being quite profitable others such as sleeping and dining cars were kept in order to provide better control over the quality of service being provided to passengers hotels were likewise crucial to the cprs growth by attracting travellerscitation needed dominion express company was formed independently in  before the cpr itself although train service did not begin until the summer of  at which time it operated over some  kilometres  mi of track from rat portage kenora ontario west to winnipeg manitoba it was soon absorbed into the cpr and expanded everywhere the cpr went it was renamed canadian express company on  september  and the headquarters moved from winnipeg to toronto it was operated as a separate company with the railway charging them to haul express cars on trains express was handled in separate cars some with employees on board on the headend of passenger trains to provide a fast scheduled service for which higher rates could be charged than for lcl less than carload lot small shipments of freight which were subject to delay aside from all sorts of small shipments for all kinds of businesses such products as cream butter poultry and eggs were handled along with fresh flowers fish and other sea foods some handled in separate refrigerated cars horses and livestock along with birds and small animals including prize cattle for exhibition were carried often in special horse cars that had facilities for grooms to ride with their animalscitation needed automobiles for individuals were also handled by express in closed boxcars gold and silver bullion as well as cash were carried in large amounts between the mint and banks and express messengers were armed for security small business money shipments and valuables such as jewellery were routinely handled in small packets money orders and travellers cheques were an important part of the express companys business and were used worldwide in the years before credit cards canadian express cartage department was formed in march  to handle pickup and delivery of most express shipments including lessthancarload freight their trucks were painted killarney dark green while regular express company vehicles were painted bright red express routes using highway trucks beginning in november  in southern ontario and alberta coordinated railway and highway service expanded service to better serve smaller locations especially on branchlines trucking operations would go on to expand across canada making it an important transport provider for small shipments deregulation in the s however changed everything and trucking services were endedwhen after many attempts to change with the timescitation needed special trainsedit silk trainsedit between the s and  the cpr transported raw silk from vancouver where they had been shipped from the orient to silk mills in new york and new jersey a silk train could carry several million dollars worth of silk so they had their own armed guards to avoid train robberies and so minimize insurance costs they travelled quickly and stopped only to change locomotives and crews which was often done in under five minutes the silk trains had superior rights over all other trains even passenger trains including the royal train of  would be put in sidings to make the silk trains trip faster at the end of world war ii the invention of nylon made silk less valuable so the silk trains died out funeral trainsedit funeral train of prime minister sir john a macdonald funeral

the country these trains transported royalty through canadas scenery forests small towns and enabled people to see and greet them their trains were elegantly decorated some had amenities such as a post office and barber shop the cprs most notable royal train was in  in  the cpr and the cnr had the honour of giving king george vi and queen elizabeth a rail tour of canada from quebec city to vancouver this was the first visit to canada by a reigning monarch the steam locomotives used to pull the train included cpr  a hudson  built by montreal locomotive works in  cnr  a ua northern  and cnr  a ub mountain  type they were specially painted royal blue with the exception of cnr  which was not painted with silver trim as was the entire train the locomotives ran  km  mi across canada through  changes of crew without engine failure the king somewhat of a railbuff rode in the cab when possible after the tour king george gave the cpr permission to use the term royal hudson for the cpr locomotives and to display royal crowns on their running boards this applied only to the semistreamlined locomotives – not the standard hudsons – better farming trainedit cpr provided the rollingstock for the better farming train which toured rural saskatchewan between  and  to promote the latest information on agricultural research it was staffed by the university of saskatchewan and operating expenses were covered by the department of agriculture school carsedit between  and the early s the cpr ran a school car to reach people who lived in northern ontario far from schools a teacher would travel in a specially designed car to remote areas and would stay to teach in one area for two to three days then leave for another area each car had a blackboard and a few sets of chairs and desks they also contained miniature libraries and accommodation for the teacher silver streakedit major shooting for the  film silver streak a fictional comedy tale of a murderinfested train trip from los angeles to chicago was done on the cpr mainly in the alberta area with station footage at torontos union station the train set was so lightly disguised as the fictional amroad that the locomotives and cars still carried their original names and numbers along with the easily identifiable cp rail redstriped paint scheme most of the cars are still in revenue service on via rail

luxury passenger cars built between  and  and is powered by firstgeneration diesel locomotives steam trainedit canadian pacific  empress at sturtevant wisconsin  september  in  the cpr repatriated one of its former passenger steam locomotives that had been on static display in the united states following its sale in january  long after the close of the steam era cpr hudson  was redesignated empress  following a month restoration that cost in excess of  million it was subsequently returned to service to promote public relations it has operated across much of the cpr system including lines in the us and been used for various charitable purposes  of the money raised goes to the nationwide charity breakfast for learning — the cpr bears all of the expenses associated with the operation of the

trainedit in  canadian pacific partnered with the  olympic and paralympic winter games to present a spirit train tour that featured olympicthemed events at various stops colin james was a headline entertainer several stops were met by protesters who argued that the games were slated to take place on stolen indigenous land nonrailway servicesedit historically canadian pacific operated several nonrailway businesses in  these businesses were split off into the separate company canadian pacific limited and in  that company was further split into five companies cp no longer provides any of these services telegraphedit the original charter of the cpr granted in  provided for the right to create an electric telegraph and telephone service including charging for it the telephone had barely been invented but telegraph was well established as a means of communicating quickly across great distances being allowed to sell this service meant the railway could offset the costs of constructing and maintaining a pole line along its tracks across vast distances for its own purposes which were largely for dispatching trains it began doing so in  as the separate telegraph department it would go on to provide a link between the cables under the atlantic and pacific oceans when they were completed prior to the cpr line messages to the west could be sent only via the united states paid for by the word the telegram was an expensive way to send messages but they were vital to businesses an individual receiving a personal telegram was seen as being someone important except for those that transmitted sorrow in the form of death notices messengers on bicycles delivered telegrams and picked up a reply in cities in smaller locations the local railway station agent would handle this on a commission basis to speed things at the local end messages would first be telephoned in  it became the communications department in recognition of the expanding services provided which included telephones lines news wire ticker quotations for the stock market and eventually teleprinters all were faster than mail and very important to business and the public alike for many decades before mobile phones and computers came along it was the coming of these newer technologies especially cellular telephones that eventually resulted in the demise of these services even after formation in  of cncp telecommunications in an effort to effect efficiencies through consolidation rather than competition deregulation in the s brought about mergers and the sale of remaining services and facilities radioedit on  january  the cpr applied for licences to operate radio stations in  cities from coast to coast for the purpose of organising its own radio network in order to compete with the cnr radio service the cnr had built a radio network with the aim of promoting itself as well as entertaining its passengers during their travels the onset of the great depression hurt the cprs financial plan for a rival project and in april they withdrew their applications for stations in all but toronto montreal and winnipeg cpr did not end up pursuing these applications but instead operated a phantom station in toronto known as cpry with initials standing for canadian pacific royal york which operated out of studios at cps royal york hotel and leased time on cfrb and ckgw a network of affiliates carried the cpr radio networks broadcasts in the first half of the s but the takeover of cnrs radio service by the new canadian radio broadcasting commission removed cprs need to have a network for competitive reasons and cprs radio service was discontinued in  steamshipsedit main article canadian pacific steamships steamships played an important part in the history of cp from the very earliest days during construction of the line in british columbia even before the private cpr took over from the government contractor ships were used to bring supplies to the construction sites similarly to reach the isolated area of superior in northern ontario ships were used to bring in supplies to the construction work while this work was going on there was already regular passenger service to the west trains operated from toronto owen sound where cpr steamships connected to fort william where trains once again operated to reach winnipeg before the cpr was completed the only way to reach the west was through the united states via st paul and winnipeg this great lakes steam ship service continued as an alternative route for many years and was always operated by the railway canadian pacific passenger service on the lakes ended in  in  cpr began purchasing sailing ships as part of a railway supply service on the great lakes over time cpr became a railroad company with widely organized water transportation auxiliaries including the great lakes service the transpacific service the pacific coastal service the british columbia lake and river service the transatlantic service and the bay of fundy ferry service in the th century the company evolved into an intercontinental railway which operated two transoceanic services which connected canada with europe and with asia the range of cpr services were aspects of an integrated plan advertisement for canadian pacific steamships to the far east  once the railway was completed to british columbia the cpr chartered and soon bought their own passenger steamships as a link to the orient these sleek steamships were of the latest design and christened with empress names e g rms empress of britain empress of canada empress of australia and so forth travel to and from the orient and cargo especially imported tea and silk were an important source of revenue aided by royal mail contracts this was an important part of the allred route linking the various parts of the british empire the other ocean part was the atlantic service to and from britain which began with acquisition of two existing lines beaver line owned by elder dempster and allan lines these two segments became canadian pacific ocean services later canadian pacific steamships and operated separately from the various lake services operated in canada which were considered to be a direct part of the railways operations these transocean routes made it possible to travel from britain to hong kong using only the cprs ships trains and hotels cps empress ships became worldfamous for their luxury and speedcitation needed they had a practical role too in transporting immigrants from much of europe to canada especially to populate the vast prairies they also played an important role in both world wars with many of them being lost to enemy action including the empress of britain there were also a number of rail ferries operated over the years as well including between windsor ontario and detroit from  until  this began with two paddlewheelers capable of carrying  cars passenger cars were carried as well as freight this service ended in  when the cpr made an agreement with the michigan central to use their detroit river tunnel opened in  pennsylvaniaontario transportation company was formed jointly with the prr in  to operate a ferry across lake erie between ashtabula ohio and port burwell ontario to carry freight cars mostly of coal much of it to be burned in cpr steam locomotives only one ferry boat was ever operated ashtabula a large vessel which eventually sank in a harbour collision in ashtabula on  september  thus ending the service canadian pacific car and passenger transfer company was formed by other interest in  linking the cpr in prescott ontario and the nyc in ogdensburg new york service on this route had actually begun very early in  along with service from brockville a bridge built in  ended passenger service however freight continued until ogdensburgs dock was destroyed by fire  september  thus ending all service cpcptc was never owned by the cpr bay of fundy ferry service was operated for passengers and freight for many years linking digby nova scotia and saint john new brunswick eventually after  years with the changing times the scheduled passenger services would all be ended as well as ocean cruises cargo would continue on both oceans with a change over to containers cp was an intermodal pioneer especially on land with road and railway mixing to provide the best service cp

bc lake and river serviceedit main article canadian pacific railway in british columbia the canadian pacific railway lake and river service british columbia lake and river service developed slowly and in spurts of growth cp began a long history of service in the kootenays region of southern british columbia beginning with the purchase in  of the columbia and kootenay steam navigation company which operated a fleet of steamers and barges on the arrow lakes and was merged into the cpr as the cpr lake and river service which also served the arrow lakes and columbia river kootenay lake and kootenai river lake okanagan and skaha lake slocan lake trout lake and shuswap lake and the thompson riverkamloops lake all of these lake operations had one thing in common the need for shallow draft therefore sternwheelers were the choice of ship tugs and barges handled railway equipment including one operation that saw the entire train including the locomotive and caboose go along these services gradually declined and ended in  except for a freight barge on slocan lake this was the one where the entire train went along since the barge was a link to an isolated section of track the iris g tug boat and a barge were operated under contract to cp rail until the last train ran late in december  the sternwheel steamship moyie on kootenay lake was the last cpr passenger boat in bc lake service having

mussels” hi im sarah “toronto is an exciting and lively city i visit every summer and love to explore the different neighbourhoods for samples of food and people watching taking in the old brick buildings and beautiful murals in kensington market or the view of the entire city from the cn tower – its all a treat to experience and you never know what to expect while wandering the streets in a big city” hi im meaghan “growing up in oakville on i was just a short distance from toronto canadas largest city is a bustling metropolis with so many incredible attractions for just about anyone there are world class museums outdoor parks boutique shops and international cuisine whenever im visiting i love to take in some local theatre from awardwinning musicals to comedy torontos theatre scene is one of the best in the world” hi im angie “i love the west coast i moved here from ontario years ago but am still in awe of the mountains and ocean i commute to work from an island and am lucky enough to get to enjoy the natural beauty of the west coast on a daily basis sometimes were even greeted by whales or dolphins as we boat in were close to worldclass ski mountains beautiful city of vancouver and are just a short ferry ride away from vancouver island” hi im eva “montreal is my favourite city in canada it’s like a little slice of europe with narrow cobblestone streets oodles of history and for the shopaholics out there some of the best shopping on the continent if you visit be sure to try the poutine a local delicacy of french fries gravy and cheese curds” hi im stephanie “my favorite place in canada is lake louise i love gazing at the sparkling turquoise waters and soaring mountains above – the beauty is breathtaking with options like strolling along the lakeside and admiring the amazing glacier hiking to viewpoints or having afternoon tea at the chateau it’s certainly a place to return to i have twice my favorite activity by far was canoeing across the lake on a summer day” hi im alisa “spending time in whistler is always an exciting experience the majestic mountains and countless activities not only make it the perfect playground for outdoor enthusiasts but also one of the most glorious places to just sit and take in the raw beauty being there during winter is incredible i love ziplining – what could be more exhilarating and the people are always so genuine and fun” hi im melanie “the lakes and mountains of british columbia are what won my heart the first time i flew over the rockies to come to vancouver – it was love at first sight panorama ridge where i stand with garibaldi lake in the background is one of many breathtaking views around garibaldi national park it is a gorgeous place to hike to camp to breathe clean air and feel the calming energy of the giant peaks with their glaciers” hi im holly “vancouver is the love of my life the stunning greenery and towering mountains that surround my city make it breathtakingly beautiful walking through lynn canyon or hiking up to quarry rock in north vancouver and i am in my happy place i also love stopping by granville island after my adventures for the best food and drink to satisfy my growling belly and then kitsilano beach is my favourite for sunset viewing” hi im greg “i am in love with our nations capital ottawa the city has many of its best sights within walking distance of each other in the centre of it all are the inspiring gothic style parliament buildings just steps away from the vibrant byward market and in what other city can you ice skate to work the rideau canal is a marvel that i will always remember” yes help me plan my trip or call us directly tollfree at     where to go canadian rockies  west coast journeys across canada east  maritimes north
