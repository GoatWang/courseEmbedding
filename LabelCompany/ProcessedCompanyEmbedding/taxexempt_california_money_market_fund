developments in the state such as tax legislative or political changes will adversely affect the securities held by the fund because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by one state and its municipalities it is more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in this state than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many statesincome risk the chance that the fund’s income will decline because of falling interest rates because the fund’s income is based on shortterm interest rates—which can fluctuate significantly over short periods—income risk is expected to be highcredit risk the chance that the issuer of a security will fail to pay interest or principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline credit risk should be very low for the fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high qualitymanager risk the chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objectivenondiversification risk the chance that the fund’s performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of relatively few securities the fund is considered nondiversified which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of particular issuers as compared with other mutual fundstax risk the chance that all or a portion of the taxexempt income from municipal bonds held by the fund will be declared taxable possibly with

range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment
