and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high below average this fund scores below average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below

borrowings for investment purposes in senior loans it invests mainly in floating rate loans sometimes referred to as adjustable rate loans that hold a senior position in the capital structure of us and foreign corporations partnerships or other business entities that under normal circumstances allow them to have priority of claim ahead of other obligations of a borrower in the event of liquidation risk floatingrate loans generally are subject to restrictions on resale and they sometimes trade infrequently in the secondary market and as a result may be more difficult to value buy or sell a floatingrate loan might not be fully collateralized which may cause the floatingrate loan to decline significantly in value the fund may invest in lowerquality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer in general the bond market is volatile and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall and vice versa this effect is usually more pronounced for longerterm securities fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties unlike individual bonds most bond funds do not have a maturity date so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not
