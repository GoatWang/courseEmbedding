how how can nextshares potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind

income fund overview objective and strategy the funds investment objective is to provide a high level of total return with an emphasis on income the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in securities of publicly traded infrastructure companies why invest in brookfield global listed infrastructure income fund inc access to a rapidly growing asset class with compelling supplydemand characteristics the growing need for infrastructure spending and the significant cost of funding such projects has led to significant growth in global listed infrastructure as an asset class historically supply and demand characteristics have been compelling driven by the combination of supply that has been constrained by high barriers to entry and relatively stable demand from essential services the attractive investment potential of global listed infrastructure the fund invests in publicly traded infrastructure companies believed by brookfield to have stable longlived assets that are essential to the global economy historically attractive longterm total returns for the asset class have been tied to cash flows derived from longterm contracts concessions and regulated revenues which tend to be stable and correlated with inflation as such the fund has the potential for the payment of attractive dividends that may grow over time the manager also believes that a portfolio composed of well diversified global infrastructure securities has the potential for capital appreciation and strong riskadjusted investment returns access to a global investment platform and a management team with longstanding infrastructure expertise the fund provides an opportunity to access a portfolio management team with deep operational and direct investment experience as well as track record investing in global listed infrastructure securities the team also draws upon internal expertise and knowledge within brookfield and its affiliates which provides extensive

manager’s proprietary investment research ■because they trade on an exchange nextshares may offer cost and tax efficiencies that can enhance shareholder returns bottom line nextshares are the next evolution of fund investing™ overview how do the costs of nextshares compare fund costs explained nextshares mutual funds and etfs are subject to different fund costs that impact investor returns what are distribution and service b fees fund payments to support the distribution of fund shares and the provision of shareholder services under rule b of the investment company act of  a fund’s b fees are typically paid to the fund’s distributor and generally pass through to intermediaries that sell fund shares permitted b fees are limited to one percent of average fund net assets annually mutual funds are often subject to b fees that vary by share class nextshares and most etfs do not pay b fees a fund’s b fees are disclosed in its prospectus and included in its total expense ratio what are transfer agency expenses the fees paid by a fund to its transfer agent and other intermediaries to process shareholder transactions and maintain shareholder accounts transfer agency costs are normally the largest component of mutual fund expenses other than management fees and b fees nextshares and etfs typically have minimal transfer agency expenses transfer agency fees are characterized as other expenses in a funds prospectus and are included in its total expense ratio what are flowrelated trading costs the trading costs a fund incurs to purchase and sell investments in connection with shareholder inflows and outflows including commissions bidask spread ie difference between the best offer price to sell a security and the best bid price to buy the security and market impact ie the effect of a purchase or sale of a security on its trading price costs flowrelated trading costs are not disclosed in a funds prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio nextshares keep flowrelated trading costs low by issuing and redeeming shares primarily in kind using securities and other noncash payments and by charging transaction fees to authorized participants professional investors who transact directly with the fund most mutual funds do not issue or redeem shares in kind or charge transaction fees what is cash drag the impact on fund performance of holding cash cash drag hurts fund performance when the returns of the funds noncash investments exceed cash returns and helps fund performance when the opposite is true cash drag is not disclosed in a funds prospectus or reflected in its total expense ratio nextshares that transact with authorized participants primarily in kind may experience less cash drag than mutual funds which often need to hold cash to meet shareholder redemptions what is a fund’s total expense ratio ter a funds total annual expenses expressed as a percentage of the funds average net assets for the year as stated in its prospectus fund ters include management fees b fees custody charges transfer agency fees and other operating expenses of the fund ters do not include flowrelated trading costs or cash drag ters also do not reflect fund sales charges or other costs borne by buyers and sellers of shares compared to mutual funds that can be purchased and sold at net asset value nextshares and etfs may be more expensive to buy and

to the fund’s distributor and generally pass through to intermediaries that sell fund shares permitted b fees are limited to one percent of average fund net assets annually mutual funds are often subject to b fees that vary by share class nextshares and most etfs do not pay b fees a fund’s b fees are disclosed in its prospectus and included in its total expense ratio what are transfer agency expenses the fees paid by a fund to its transfer agent and other intermediaries to process shareholder transactions and maintain shareholder accounts transfer agency costs are normally the largest component of mutual fund expenses other than management fees and b fees nextshares and etfs typically have minimal transfer agency expenses transfer agency fees are characterized as other expenses in

normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in
