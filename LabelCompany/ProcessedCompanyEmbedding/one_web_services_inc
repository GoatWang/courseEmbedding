basis with a freetier option available for  months the technology allows subscribers to have at their disposal a fullfledged virtual cluster of computers available all the time through the internet aws version of virtual computers have most of the attributes of a real computer including hardware cpus  gpus for processing localram memory harddiskssd storage a choice of operating systems networking and preloaded application software such as web servers databases crm etc each aws system also virtualizes its console io keyboard display and mouse allowing aws subscribers to connect to their aws system using a modern browser the browser acts as a window into the virtual computer letting subscribers login configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer they can choose to deploy their aws systems to provide internetbased services for their own and their customers benefit the aws technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world and maintained by the amazon subsidiary fees are based on a combination of usage the hardwareossoftwarenetworking features chosen by the subscriber required availability redundancy security and service options based on what the subscriber needs and pays for they can reserve a single virtual aws computer a cluster of virtual computers a physical real computer dedicated for their exclusive use or even a cluster of dedicated physical computers as part of the subscription agreement amazon manages upgrades and provides industrystandard security to each subscribers system aws operates from many

operate across availability zones eg s dynamodb while others can be configured to replicate across zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures as of december  amazon web services operated

vision for amazons retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized completely automated and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on

choice of operating systems networking and preloaded application software such as web servers databases crm etc each aws system also virtualizes its console io keyboard display and mouse allowing aws subscribers to connect to their aws system using a modern browser the browser acts as a window into the virtual computer letting subscribers login configure and use their virtual systems just as they would a real physical computer they can choose to deploy their aws systems to provide internetbased services for their own and their customers benefit the aws technology is implemented at server farms throughout the world and maintained by the amazon subsidiary fees are based on a combination of usage the hardwareossoftwarenetworking features chosen by the subscriber required availability

designated region each region has multiple availability zones which consist of one or more discrete data centers each with redundant power networking and connectivity housed in separate facilities availability zones do not automatically provide additional scalability or redundancy within a region since they are intentionally isolated from each other to prevent outages from spreading between zones several services can operate across availability zones eg s dynamodb while others can be configured to replicate across zones to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures as of december  amazon web services operated an estimated  million servers across  availability zones the global network of aws edge locations consists of  points of presence worldwide including locations in the

summit  event in nyc the aws platform was launched in july  to expose technology and product data from amazon and its affiliates enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own in the beginning the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services then in late  the aws concept was publicly reformulated when chris pinkham and benjamin black presented a paper describing a vision for amazons retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized completely automated and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway near the end of their paper they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment in november  the first aws service launched for public usage simple queue service sqs thereafter pinkham and lead developer christoper brown developed the amazon ec service with a team in cape town south africa amazon web services was officially relaunched on march   combining the three initial service offerings of amazon s cloud storage sqs and ec the aws platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services as chris pinkham and benjamin black had proposed back in  as a service offered to other developers web sites clientside applications and companies andy jassy aws founder and vice president in  said at the time that amazon s one of the first and most scalable elements of aws helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data whether it will be safe and secure if it will be available when they need it the costs associated with server maintenance or whether they have enough storage available amazon s enables developers to focus on innovating with data rather than figuring out how to store it his quote marks a milestone in the internets history when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide allowing them to offer new scalable webenabled technologies in  jassy was promoted to ceo of the division reflecting the success of aws his annual compensation in  hit nearly  million to support industrywide training and skills standardization aws began offering a certification program for computer engineers on april   to highlight expertise in

suffered a major outage parts of the elastic block store ebs service became stuck and could not fulfill readwrite requests it took at least two days for service to be fully restored on june   several websites that rely on amazon web services were taken offline due to a severe storm in northern virginia where aws largest data center cluster is located on october   a major outage occurred affecting many sites such as reddit foursquare pinterest and others the cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent on december   aws suffered another outage causing websites such as netflix to be unavailable for customers in the northeastern united states aws cited their elastic load balancing elb service as the cause on february   aws experienced a massive outage of s services in its northern virginia data center a majority of websites which relied on aws s either hung or stalled and amazon reported within five hours that aws was fully online again no data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage the outage was caused by a human error made while debugging that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended which caused a domino effect of outages

summit  event in nyc the aws platform was launched in july  to expose technology and product data from amazon and its affiliates enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own in the beginning the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services then in late  the aws concept was publicly reformulated when chris pinkham and benjamin black presented a paper describing a vision for amazons retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized completely automated and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway near the end of their paper they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment in november  the first aws service launched for public usage simple queue service sqs thereafter pinkham and lead developer christoper brown developed the amazon ec service with a team in cape town south africa amazon web services was officially relaunched on march   combining the three initial service offerings of amazon s cloud storage sqs and ec the aws platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services as chris pinkham and benjamin black had proposed back in  as a service offered to other developers web sites clientside applications and companies andy jassy aws founder and vice president in  said at the time that amazon s one of the first and most scalable elements of aws helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data whether it will be safe and secure if it will be available when they need it the costs associated with server maintenance or whether they have enough storage available amazon s enables developers to focus on innovating with data rather than figuring out how to store it his quote marks a milestone in the internets history when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide allowing them to offer new scalable webenabled technologies in  jassy was promoted to ceo of the division reflecting the success of aws his annual compensation in  hit nearly  million to support industrywide training and skills standardization aws began offering a certification program for computer engineers on april   to highlight expertise in

websites that rely on amazon web services were taken offline due to a severe storm in northern virginia where aws largest data center cluster is located on october   a major outage occurred affecting many sites such as reddit foursquare pinterest and others the cause was a memory leak bug in an operational data collection agent on december   aws suffered another outage causing websites such as

in its northern virginia data center a majority of websites which relied on aws s either hung or stalled and amazon reported within five hours that aws was fully online again no data has been reported to have been lost due to the outage the outage was caused by a human error made while debugging that resulted in removing more server capacity than intended which caused a domino effect of outages

summit  event in nyc the aws platform was launched in july  to expose technology and product data from amazon and its affiliates enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own in the beginning the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services then in late  the aws concept was publicly reformulated when chris pinkham and benjamin black presented a paper describing a vision for amazons retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized completely automated and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway near the end of their paper they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment in november  the first aws service launched for public usage simple queue service sqs thereafter pinkham and lead developer christoper brown developed the amazon ec service with a team in cape town south africa amazon web services was officially relaunched on march   combining the three initial service offerings of amazon s cloud storage sqs and ec the aws platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services as chris pinkham and benjamin black had proposed back in  as a service offered to other developers web sites clientside applications and companies andy jassy aws founder and vice president in  said at the time that amazon s one of the first and most scalable elements of aws helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data whether it will be safe and secure if it will be available when they need it the costs associated with server maintenance or whether they have enough storage available amazon s enables developers to focus on innovating with data rather than figuring out how to store it his quote marks a milestone in the internets history when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide allowing them to offer new scalable webenabled technologies in  jassy was promoted to ceo of the division reflecting the success of aws his annual

summit  event in nyc the aws platform was launched in july  to expose technology and product data from amazon and its affiliates enabling developers to build innovative and entrepreneurial applications on their own in the beginning the platform consisted of only a few disparate tools and services then in late  the aws concept was publicly reformulated when chris pinkham and benjamin black presented a paper describing a vision for amazons retail computing infrastructure that was completely standardized completely automated and would rely extensively on web services for services such as storage and would draw on internal work already underway near the end of their paper they mentioned the possibility of selling access to virtual servers as a service proposing the company could generate revenue from the new infrastructure investment in november  the first aws service launched for public usage simple queue service sqs thereafter pinkham and lead developer christoper brown developed the amazon ec service with a team in cape town south africa amazon web services was officially relaunched on march   combining the three initial service offerings of amazon s cloud storage sqs and ec the aws platform finally provided an integrated suite of core online services as chris pinkham and benjamin black had proposed back in  as a service offered to other developers web sites clientside applications and companies andy jassy aws founder and vice president in  said at the time that amazon s one of the first and most scalable elements of aws helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data whether it will be safe and secure if it will be available when they need it the costs associated with server maintenance or whether they have enough storage available amazon s enables developers to focus on innovating with data rather than figuring out how to store it his quote marks a milestone in the internets history when massive managed resources became available to developers worldwide allowing them to offer new scalable webenabled technologies in  jassy was promoted to ceo of the division reflecting the success of aws his annual

me up online business onetoone marketing on the web by martha rogers phd write a comment credit the peppers and rogers group is online at marketing to in the old days of the internetthat would be  and almost every new web site attracted curious surfers but that was before the number of sites on the web exploded and today it can take weeks even months just to get a popular search engine such as yahoo to record your existence getting your site to pop up at the top of a search is almost impossible too many businesses small and large expect their web site to be a source of new customers but why does a random prospect deserve more attention than your loyal customers instead its far easier to use the internet to work with your current customers you already interact in some way with your clientele through product deliveries invoices telephone calls mailings training or product support adding a web site to your roster of communication methods lets you reinforce your onetoone service in a supercharged way consider the example of kids r kids a rapidly growing daycare center based in marietta ga the kids r kids center which cares for  children ages six weeks to twelve years old uses the web to let clients watch their children during the day owner elaine kamienny installed  video cameras from parentnets kindercam system throughout her center and gave parents access to a special area on the web to be able to see what their kids are doing at any given moment images are refreshed every five seconds with plans for a realtime system soon kamienny doesnt charge extra for this added service instead citing it as another example that we are a center of influence she estimates that about  of parents access daycare images over the web and she believes it helps them feel more connected to their kids kids r kids recognized the real power of the web which is to develop deeper relationships with the customers it already has in fact the web provides the most costefficient method ever invented for interacting with customers even when youre sleeping your web site can be gathering information about the needs of individual customers and helping to satisfy those needs every business can use the web to focus on their existing customers here are a few ways create a personal web page for each valuable customer and log their purchases automatically on your site include all purchases whether inperson over the phone or online then invite customers to visit their sites and record their impressions of the products an example wine spectator online which includes a personal wine list feature services like this help customers keep track of their preferences over time making it easier for a company to do a better job of suggesting other products a customer might enjoy establish a tell us what you think sneak preview section on your web site to show off new products ask your customers for feedback and use it to better understand their needs and preferences marshall industries a  billion electronics wholesaler has been doing this since  technology has advanced since then while costs have come downto make similar solutions feasible for smaller companies create a passwordprotected site that enables clients to see work in progress and log their comments online design studios and small ad agencies in particular can benefit from this because its more efficient to put the work in a central location than to email or snail mail it to several different people plus this kind of system lets everyone see how others have reacted and whose comments are missing an example rage systems a multimedia design company started three years ago uses lotus domino software to allow roundtheclock collaboration between the firms artists technicians programmers and clients features like these will allow you to avoid having your site become a mundane spot on the web face it using the web solely to post static pictures and copywhat some call brochurewareis like using television to broadcast a script of a tv show instead of the show itself whichever ways your company chooses to use the web be sure youre using it to talk with customers rather than at them don peppers and martha rogers are authors of the bestselling the one to one future building relationships one customer at a time an excerpt of their second book enterprise one to one appeared in the
