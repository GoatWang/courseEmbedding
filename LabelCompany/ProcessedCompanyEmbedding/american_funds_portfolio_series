consists of three managed portfolios — conservative moderate and enhanced — that can help retirees address their income and longevity needs made up of american funds these portfolios were created by the american funds portfolio oversight committee — a sevenmember team of senior investment managers — based on extensive research and their indepth knowledge of the underlying funds seek to support varying withdrawal rate ranges and risk tolerances while maintaining as much of a retiree’s initial investment as possible were designed to be a part of a broadly diversified retirement income portfolio  overview  portfolios features benefits portfoliooversight jump to  overview  portfolios features  benefits portfolio oversight overview a recent survey found that the chief concern among retirees is having the ability to maintain their lifestyles in retirement in addition investors in retirement want to be assured of asset growth as they take withdrawals from their investments the american funds retirement income portfolio series strives to be a withdrawal source for a retiree’s lifestyle — or discretionary — spending needs as a complement to other investments and sources of income in their portfolios preserve as much of the initial investment as possible even as retirees take regular withdrawals translating need and risk into withdrawal rate ranges the american funds portfolio oversight committee used extensive research and modeling to determine the suggested annual withdrawal rate ranges for each of the three portfolios risk of loss in this case is defined by the portfolio oversight committee as an increased exposure to equities which can lead to greater volatility in the portfolio and potentially impact both withdrawal rates and whether overall assets invested will decline over time each retirement income portfolio is designed to address varying income needs and risk tolerances and each has a suggested annual withdrawal rate range these suggested withdrawal rate ranges were determined by the portfolio oversight committee based on their experience and indepth knowledge of the underlying funds as well as the extensive research and computer simulations used to create each portfolio were based on income and capital gain expectations — taken from both historical data as well as market projections — for each of the portfolios are suggestions only and should be evaluated over time these ranges are a starting point the actual rate should be determined on an individual basis by the financial advisor and retiree and should be adjusted to maintain sustainability in various market conditions in addition differences in the portfolio returns inflation or deflation and interest rates over time may prompt the portfolio oversight committee to change the suggested withdrawal rate ranges may include part of the investor’s principal to the extent the income earned by the portfolio in dividends and bond income is less than the withdrawal amount the portfolios are designed to accommodate this and will seek to grow assets over time as well as provide withdrawals though there is no guarantee the portfolios will support a given withdrawal rate in all market environments should be determined by individual investors as one part of their total retirement income picture including social security or other sources of guaranteed or

successfully managing funds to pursue investor objectives — developed and monitor the american funds retirement income portfolio series retirement income portfolios are complex at times the need to take withdrawals can conflict with the desire for capital preservation the historical roles of stocks and bonds have shifted in recent years making the interplay between markets more difficult to navigate that’s why the committee performed exhaustive proprietary research analyzing both historical data and likely future scenarios deployed data that reflects both even and extreme market conditions relied on their deep experience in managing the underlying american funds these seven seasoned american funds portfolio managers offer experience the committee averages 7 years of industry

 7 brought to you by investment american funds ‘you asked for it’ claiming they are giving advisors what they asked for american funds recently rolled out its new ‘portfolio series’ of funds it remains to be seen if the new products will help staunch the severe outflow of assets at the once dominant fund company diana britton  may 9  american funds longconsidered the darling of the mutual fund world recently rolled out a series of funds of funds based on three investor objectives—preservation balance and appreciation—and they want to make sure investors get the word the fund company has historically avoided journalists and advertising but the company is making a big push to get in front of advisors with this most recent launch which advertises in advisorfacing publications for the first time the company says the funds were designed to meet frequently heard requests from advisors but time will tell whether the new offering really will attract advisors back to american funds and boost their asset flows “first and foremost they have to show that they learned their lessons from  and that’s essentially a performance issue” said janet yang mutual fund analyst at morningstar  american funds has bled  billion in assets in the last year in  the company saw outflows of 9 billion according to morningstar in a february  cover story we questioned whether the outflows were a longterm reversal for the company or whether they signaled a buying opportunity yang believes the company is rolling out the new funds of funds because they’ve been losing so much money and they’re trying to regain the trust of investors and advisors investors expected the funds to hold up better than they did in  even with the market meltdown you asked for it but denise cassin senior vice president and director of the individual investor business for american fund distributors said the funds were launched out of advisor demand advisors were asking for help combining and building portfolios of american funds in a simple way despite suggesting different mixes and allocations of its funds to advisors the firm never put those models into one fund structure with the exception of their targetdate funds “a lot of advisors use our funds but over periods of time they would come to us and say ‘can you give us your best thinking on how to put them together and then make it easy for us to execute on that’” cassin said the portfolio series includes eight funds of funds categorized under three investor objective buckets two of the funds are for investors with shortterm needs and want to keep their money stable four funds are aimed at investors with longer time horizons and who need a little more growth and the other two are for investors who need a higher potential of growth cassin believes these strategies will help investors stay on track particularly when markets get volatile and difficult “if the market is volatile there’s going to be an emotional tendency to panic and probably do something that’s not good in the long term but if i’ve separated things by objective it generally gives me a little more confidence to stay the course” what about doityourselfers but yang said she was initially surprised with american funds’ announcement given that their clients are mostly advisors “we assumed that advisors were putting together these portfolios themselves” cassin said that while it’s true the new suite of funds are another tool for advisors who want an easy solution to put portfolios together the company is aware not all will want to do that “i think there are still going to be advisors who want to put portfolios together use our funds package them up as they see fit” harold nahigian a regional director with financial network said the new funds are a good move for the company as they save advisors time having to come up with allocations of american funds on their own this could also help advisors with finra’s new suitability requirements which take effect in july nahigian said he’s had to revise his office’s account form from one page to four pages to include a series of questions about clients’ risk tolerance because these new funds are categorized by risk tolerance they may help advisors meet the suitability requirements by putting clients into one of these funds a different asset allocation approach the portfolios are put together by the same team that constructs the target date funds those funds use a different asset allocation strategy than the rest of the industry yang said while most fund managers feed their stock and bond expectations into an optimizer american funds looks at investor goals and allocates to those buckets they use their managers’ knowledge of the markets to decide how they classify the funds in addition many fund managers will come up with assumptions for how they think the retiree will spend down their savings american funds does not use such assumptions yang said the results have been mixed in 9 the firm had to make a big change to its target date portfolios because they miscalculated where the markets were going yang added in particular their allocation to equities was pretty high for people close to retirement or in retirement and they brought that allocation down one the one hand “their portfolio construction process is a little bit squishy for us” yang said on the other hand “their managers do tend to have a lot of experience and tenure with the firm” it’s hard to say whether the move will attract and bring back advisors but it might help make fund allocation and execution easier for them yang said the funds will carry the underlying management fees of the funds that make it up and the firm has chosen to waive an extra  basispointfee it could’ve put on top of that in addition being a fund of funds there’s only one ticket charge so advisors can execute on a trade and be in multiple funds at once without having to pay extra fees cassin said tags mutual funds
