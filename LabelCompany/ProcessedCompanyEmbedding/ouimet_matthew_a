united kingdom united states close the blog   pm et  updated sep   cedar fair ceo matt ouimet reveals the secret of running a successful amusement park by jim hill for matt ouimet the president and ceo of cedar fair entertainment co a typical day at the office really is a walk in the park to be honest i dont think id like this job if i was forced to be cooped up in an office when you work in the amusement park business you have to see where things are working and you have to see where theyre not ouimet admitted in a recent phone interview i couldnt be one of those guys whod try and run a place like knotts berry farm just by sitting in his office and working off a spreadsheet im sure there are others who can do that but im not one of them i probably would not be as good at this job if i couldnt regularly get out in the parks mind you given the  amusement parks that matt rides herd on are spread across the united states and canada staying on top of whats going on at each of these cedar fair properties involves an awful lot of travel take  for example  how ill be spending the next two weeks i leave knotts on sunday  actually monday morning  and then i start my road trip im going to toronto to see our new dark ride wonder mountains guardian this attraction actually has a lot in common with disney worlds new seven dwarfs mine train ride its a coaster track though wonder mountains guardian has the longest interactive screen in the world which features a gaming element where you then try to get the top score ouimet explained and by the time i get back to cedar point toward the end of this month l will have managed to have hit all of our parks  and most of that is good of course one of the biggest challenges that matt faces is recognizing that each of these amusement parks is different that they all have their own personalities thats one of the main reasons cedar fair has different names on all of our parks we dont try and put them under one big brand theyre all unique in their own special ways ouimet stated take  for example  knotts berry farm which is right in the middle of one of the most competitive theme park markets in the world within  miles of knotts you have legoland california you have seaworld san diego you have universal studios hollywood and you have the disneyland resort so in the southern california market its really important to figure out who you are and then be extremely disciplined about it i mean think about it knotts berry farm cant be about the movies and we cant be about fantasy we have to be who we are matt continued so when it comes to knotts we want to be that place where having fun is still fun or as raffi kaprelyan  the vice president and general manager at knotts berry farm  says where people can still have organically grown fun we want to be the theme park in this market thats uncomplicated affordable familiar but still has a few surprises so thats our goal with knotts berry farm to occupy that space in the highly competitive southern california marketplace to be comfortable with that space and not try and be one of those other guys one huge advantage we have in this market is that people still have a strong affinity for what the knotts family created ouimet said so i hope that  with the respectful upgrades  improvements weve made to ghost town the timber mountain log ride the calico mine train and camp snoopy over the past three years  we wind up being known as the community park not the corporate park and to some degree i think being a little smaller has probably worked to our advantage with knotts its worth noting here that all of the changes that matt  his team have made since he came on board at the cedar fair entertainment co in june of  have had a significant impact on knotts berry farms bottom line just last year this buena park institution had the most successful year from both an attendance standpoint as well as a profitability pointofview ever and given that knotts is the second most profitable park in the cedar fair system thats a really nice feather in ouimets cap and the good news is were not done with knotts weve got a five year plan in place for this theme park and im hoping that  with cedar fairs help  ill then have the privilege of turning that into a ten year plan matt enthused its not exactly a closely guarded secret that  when it comes to knotts  were trying to figure out what to do with the area where kingdom of the dinosaurs  knotts beary tales used to be located assuming that the wonder mountains guardian ride works out there will probably be some lessons that we learned up in canada that we can apply down here in buena park its worth noting here that knotts berry farm isnt the only cedar fair property to be singled out by ouimet for some much needed tlc next year is carowinds year weve announced were making a major investment in that park  million over the next few years and were really looking forward to it matt said but just as he did when ouimet took his first stroll around knotts berry farm and identified the areas in that theme park that could be plussed  improved matt and his team walked the length of carowinds looking for ways they could improve that amusement park while still preserving its obvious charms in the end i want people to think of the cedar fair parks like they do their best friends house if they live out of town ouimet explained you know when you go there that youre going to have fun youre going to be welcome youre going to relive some memories as well as create some new ones youre going to laugh and its always something youre going to look forward to but again you just dont see those areas that can be plussed or improved if youre hunched over a spreadsheet which is why  several times a year  matt hops on a plane travels to all  amusement parks and then puts on his walking shoes ive always prided myself on the ability to look at the amusement park experience through the guests eyes which is why i still like to be out in the parks i still like to walk around make sure the guests are still having a good time ouimet said i mean its honestly not that complicated people dont want things to be too expensive they want to be able to have fun with their friends and their family they want to eat a nice meal while theyre in the park they want to experience some new rides as well as revisit some old favorites and they want to laugh a little bit if you can consistently deliver that experience  and thats what we try to do at each of our cedar fair properties  people will come back again and again ouimet concluded follow jim hill on twitter wwwtwittercomjimhillmedia jim hill entertainment journalist and walt disney company expert more cedar fair universal studios hollywood raffi

matthew ouimet memo cedar point to build coaster in    years ago by andrew in news and updates news stories ride watch rides rollercoasters from the sandusky register… sandusky cedar fair stands ready to spend big money on a new roller coaster for  at cedar point that will change the park landscape codenamed “cp altwinged” the coaster will have the “longest drop run the fastest and be the longest ride” of its kind cedar fair ceo matt ouimet wrote in feb  memo to cedar fair’s board of directors the total projected cost of the project is  million a price that includes removing the park’s space spiral and disaster transport rides and restructuring the park entrance ouimet was unavailable for comment tuesday lee alexakos corporate vice president of marketing declined to confirm the information in the memo “we have not announced any plans for  but we did announce a  million investment” alexakos said “this will be one of the largest capital expenditures ever” alexakos said that with any ride or attraction cedar point undertakes the company is always looking to set records the swissbased bolliger  mabillard consulting engineers is set to design the new ride which was described in the memo as having a “front gate statement— a roller coaster that flies overhead rolls and flies back— highly visible above guests entering the park” the firm designed cedar point’s raptor a winged coaster is designed to suspend riders on wings to the sides of the rails so there is no track above or below the guest engineering schematics show a proposed coaster with gravity defying twists curves and rolls “rob decker cedar fair vp of planning and design and others have done a great job of creating a compelling economically attractive new coaster for cedar point” ouimet wrote “we believe this particular ride design with this particular manufacturer balances the desire for marketable innovation and risk associated with early adaptations of prototypes” bolliger  mabillard designed the first winged coaster for installation in italy at a park known as gardaland the six flags great american park outside of chicago also has one of the company’s winged coasters called xflight the new ride at cedar point could promise to be a work horse available to guests at almost any time they are in the park “rob talked to operators of the first one in italy and found no unanticipated negatives and very high ride reliability less than  percent operational downtime design plans show the new ride with a foot tall lift that will fly overhead of park guests entering the park it will have the longest track and longest ride time of any coaster of its style as it flies overhead rolls and then fly back the huge roller coaster will dominate the front gate and the track will travel over a large parking area at the park “we have several coasters that cover parking lots” ouimet wrote “not necessarily ideal but certainly acceptable given tight site constraints and the amount of land such attractions require” disaster transport and the space spiral both would have to come down if the site plan currently under consideration is chosen part of the  million investment will also include renovations and upgrades at the park entrance from the parking lot cedar point general manger john hildebrandt was not available for comment on tuesday tweet  cedar fair cedar point ceo cp guide cp disaster transport matthew ouimet may  news ride watch rides rollercoasters space spiral stories new cedar fair ceo has fresh outlook on fun   years ago by andrew in attractions behind the scenes dinosaurs alive news and updates news stories off season rides rollercoasters from the toledo blade… sandusky — walking along cedar point amusement park’s midway and arriving at a spot where a new lightlasersandfireworks show will entertain guests this june matt ouimet cedar fair lp’s ebullient new chief executive officer can no longer contain himself “isn’t that a great view” he says gazing across a plaza where a large video screen has been removed to reveal the towering millennium force roller coaster bathed in the sunlight of a cloudless blue sky “we really should be open today what a great day” said mr ouimet not bothering to conceal his pride in cedar point which this day is devoid of people other than a handful of workers painting repairing and primping the grand old amusement park for its may  opening the excitement in mr ouimet’s voice is audible the bounce in his step visible and the twinkle in the eye of the former disney co executive perceptible although he spent  years as a trusted disney lieutenant running its historic disneyland theme park and popular cruise line it is clear that in sandusky the yearold mr ouimet knows he finally is captain of his own ship cedar fair the nation’s thirdlargest amusement park chain with  parks including the flagship cedar point plus six water parks and five hotels mr ouimet who also spent short stints running starwood hotels  resorts worldwide and corinthian colleges was chosen last june to be president of cedar fair and heirapparent to longtime company executive dick kinzel when mr kinzel retired on jan  after  years with cedar fair mr ouimet gained the ceo title and the keys to the candy store so to speak the new ceo’s acumen as an amusement park executive is well documented — he developed and implemented a comprehensive strategic plan leading to a significantly improved and sustained performance for disneyland’s th anniversary in  and the cedar fair board clearly found in mr ouimet a kindred replacement for mr kinzel whose fondness for walking the midway and riding the roller coasters revealed him to be both a top executive and a big kid at heart mr ouimet acknowledged that if a staff meeting were to drag on too long he isn’t above calling a halt and taking the participants into the park to ride a coaster something he did one day last summer above all the new ceo said that he’s honored to be cedar fair’s new custodian and plans to take the company’s parks in directions they may not have gone before to enhance their value not just for customers but also investors “a person once told me that there’s a difference between revering history and respecting history respecting history reminds you to look at what’s really important and learn from it” mr ouimet said “revering it means you never change anything and if you don’t make change … we won’t be here in  or  years “and so i think that’s the delicate balance when you’ve got such a loyal audience you know you’re always going to have somebody disappointed that the ride they rode as a yearold is no longer here” mr ouimet said “but i hope they’re equally excited or more excited about what replaced it i think that’s one of the hardest parts of my job is to try to figure out where change is good and where legacy is good” though a confirmed disney disciple — he still slips up and calls employees “cast members” about half the time — mr ouimet said he has no plans to disneyfy cedar fair the millennium force gets some new paint a string of unseasonably warm days has helped maintenance workers get a jumpstart on sprucing up the park before it opens on may  the bladeamy e voigt instead he said he plans to use lessons he learned from the premier themepark firm wherever applicable at the sanduskybased chain “it’s funny but when i was considering this job i went back to the history here — there’s some wonderful books on it — and what you realize is there’s a lot of parallels” mr ouimet said “i think the other thing that’s common here is the value system of the people who visit us and the people who work here” he said “disney was really founded on midwestern values and i think that clearly in the cedar fair portfolio that’s part of the dna both for our guests and for our employees that’s maybe why i feel as comfortable as i do here” he said last week mr ouimet was having a hard time staying at his desk the warm weather and sprucing up of cedar point beckoning him into the park like a siren’s song “so the good news is the weather was i’m told unseasonably warm clearly we’ve been able to get ahead of our maintenance and cosmetics and annual maintenance scheduled” he said “so the millennium force is almost fully painted the blue streak is almost done the giant wheel is almost done” however special lighting for the park’s new nighttime show “luminosity ignite the night” is proving more complex than he imagined “that will be a little bit of crunch time but that show doesn’t launch until the beginning of june so i’ve got a little bit more time to work at night but obviously when i open the park in may i don’t want the consumer to see a lot of construction” mr ouimet said at disneyland mr ouimet and other disney execs always were aware of cedar fair and its southern california venue knott’s berry farm disney never viewed knott’s as a true competitor mr ouimet said but it was always jealous of the sandusky company’s ability to turn high profits “i studied cedar fair on and off for  years they were known — and i give dick kinzel the credit for this — as great operators … we studied them and marveled at the quality of the product they could deliver and still deliver the margins they delivered because that was candidly where my focus was” mr ouimet said “how could they do this and still deliver the returns they did to their investors” mr ouimet admits he “never fully cracked the code” now in control of knott’s mr ouimet admits it would be nice if disney executives looked his way and wonder how he does it “i hope my former colleagues feel a little pressure i know that they’re paying a little more attention” he said if disney officials are paying attention they might recognize a similar philosophy a “kind of emotional sentiment” that mr ouimet plans to emphasize at cedar fair “we are successful here if i can get you to come with your family and friends and laugh and smile i’ve created value for you and value for my shareholders” mr ouimet said “and whether it be cedar point knott’s kings island or kings dominion that’s really our mission” mr ouimet is convinced laughs and smiles go best with friends and family and while cedar fair parks have been good at providing thrills a friend and family connection may have been somewhat overlooked in response it will launch a new marketing campaign “thrills connect” to show people that they can go to a cedar fair park never get on a coaster but still have a great day with family “we want to remind people that time with family time with friends is precious this is the place to spend it” mr ouimet said over time mr ouimet said he plans to build more rides that families from a young child to a grandmother can enjoy together “i think that we’re known for thrill rides i think we will always be known for thrill rides but there clearly is an opportunity to expand the offering for children” mr ouimet said “so you’ll see us over time try to make sure we’re adding enough for the young families because if i can get you to come at that age …you start your relationship with us earlier you stay with us longer i’m absolutely convinced of it” several cedar fair’s parks have room to add family rides but cedar point built on a peninsula has always been landchallenged but mr ouimet said the problem isn’t huge there are underutilized areas and employee dormitories on the grounds could be relocated off the peninsula he said mr ouimet said the most underused attraction at cedar point is its beach — which was the focus of the park when it was founded in  “you can come here and not even know we have a beach so one of the things we’re going to encourage people to do is make more use of the beach because it’s nice” said mr ouimet adding that he plans to add cabanas tents chairs and other recreational services this summer to lure more visitors to the cedar point beach mr ouimet could have started his tenure as ceo slowly but he seemed determined to hit the ground running when his hiring was announced last june the company which had record revenues of  billion profits of  million and a record attendance of  million in  had already announced last year a new  million attraction dinosaurs alive for  at its flagship cedar point park the attraction which made its debut last year at kings island near cincinnati is being duplicated at three other parks but mr ouimet wanted customers to have more he ordered the creation of luminosity a mix of lights lasers fireworks music and dancing that reportedly will cost  million and he hopes entice people to stay longer in the park if the show performs as expected it will be duplicated next year at other parks he also asked for and got two new peanuts characters — woodstock and franklin — to delight children at the park’s camp snoopy area and he will have a snoopy show to fill the luminosity stage in the daytime the former disney executive also turned his focus on three other items he hopes will make a difference food marketing and ecommerce cedar point used to be known for its delicious french fries but the recipe was laborintensive so several years ago it abandoned its popular recipe in favor of quicker service “operations vice president phil bender who runs about half of our parks for us is now bringing back the original recipe at all the parks …it will take us longer but they should taste really really good” mr ouimet said “the food in the parks to some degree has been an afterthought so this year we’re going to have in our major burger places all fresh burgers never frozen” he said “so with those the french fries and we’ve got some other little surprises that we’re going to do for the food we’re trying to make that part of it a little better” marketing in mr ouimet’s view wasn’t a cedar fair strength so he created a chief marketing officer position and filled it with kelly semmelroth a former disney colleague “i needed someone like kelly who can take what i would call modern marketing techniques she is very much into crm — customer relationship marketing — which is ‘how much do i understand my consumers’ ‘how do i capture their information’ ‘how do i communicate with them in the digital era’ ” if the individual parks gathered that information it would have produced  databases mr ouimet said but ms semmelroth can centralize data to find economies of scale yet still allow each park the independence to do what is needed for their markets he added an area where mr ouimet already has made progress is ecommerce previously each park had its own web site and methods of ticket sales but late last year the new ceo standardized the web sites so they can offer discounts on tickets and other premium services “from a system technology standpoint the rides were as technologically advanced as anything you’ll see in the industry from a back of the house standpoint we were probably behind the curve” mr ouimet said of cedar fair’s previous technological efforts the growth of smart phones and other devices has necessitated new ways to reach customers he said “the way i see it today is before you grab your car keys to go on a road trip to cedar point you grab your keyboard to see what you’re going to do and what tickets you’re going to buy” he said “so clearly today when somebody sees our commercial on television i guarantee you the vast majority are going to the web site and i needed that web site to be able to be of value to the consumer” in return cedar fair can communicate with its guests in ways it couldn’t before the ceo added “i can now talk to every kid instantly and i think that’s how you balance out the technology side i guarantee you we’ll come up with things we haven’t even thought of yet using technology for people to enjoy the parks better to stay in touch with each other” tweet  shows april  attractions behind the scenes

all content of the call will be considered fully disclosed now i will turn the call over to matt ouimet matt ouimet thank you stacy and thank you for joining us this morning as youd expect our main focus during the first quarter is to prepare our seasonal parks for opening not very firm our year around park in southern california is our only park with meaningful first quarter operations and with summer fast approaching as of today we have eight properties in operation and our flagship park cedar point is set to open this weekend for its th operating season we will keep our prepared remarks brief this morning because as noted in our release our first quarter operations represent less than  of our expected full year net revenues as such we would caution that our results in the first quarter are not indicative of performance for the remainder of  additionally our first quarter results are not directly ccomparable with the prior year due to later timing of the easter and spring break holiday this year to normalize for this counter shift i will speak to attendance and revenue trends through the end of april which will provide you with a better understanding of our early season trends preliminary net revenues through the end of april achieved a new record high of  million up  when compared with the first four months of last year during this time guest spending is up  well attendance was comparable with last years record number of visits as i expect you anticipated knotts berry farms first quarter performance was below expectations due to the droughtcorrecting rains in california however the continued growth and the popularity of knotts boysenberry festival and return to more normal southern california weather resulted in record attendance revenues and per caps in april for knotts similarly several of our early opening seasonal parks gotten of solid starts helping to drive the strong april results kings dominion our park in richmond virginia had its best april in years while carowinds in charlotte north carolina had its strongest single weak for spring break in the parks history continuing to validate our confidence in this parks longterm potential meanwhile our newest wooden coaster at kings island opened to rave reviews with the parks seasonal pass holder event being the best attended attraction opening in the parks history this great thrill ride combined with intriguing story line and digital special effects is clearly hitting the mark and positions the park for what should be another great year we recognized that this time of year our investors are looking for data points that may prove predictive of our annual results i would remind you that more than twothirds of our attendance comes from advance purchase commitments including season pass sales group bookings resort reservations and purchases made on our ecommerce platform todate approximately  of anticipated season pass sales have been made while bookings for hotel rooms and group outings are little earlier in this cycle our top line message is that early season trends and advance purchase commitments continue to support a very positive outlook for  season pass revenue is up  with both unit prices and unit sales up nicely also every one of our all season products including food beverage and photo continue to grow in volume and penetration rates meanwhile team registrations at the new sports force parks at cedar point are well ahead of our first year expectations we expect to build on this early season momentum when two of our largest investments this year the renovation expansion of our separately gated water parks at cedar point and knotts berry farm open at the end of may cedar fairs disciplined attention to detail will be obvious to our guests as weve taken this opportunity to not only add new thrill slides but also wet playground specifically designed for young families new food facilities with shaded seating areas new bars hundreds of new chairs and umbrellas and expanded amenities such as private cabanas these changes will drive near term results and will serve us well for many years to come these early season reference points along with the other new attractions that i will discuss later allow us to remain confident that we will achieve our funforward  goal of  million of adjusted ebitda by the end of  a year earlier than planned now i will turn the call over to brian to discuss the first quarter results in detail brian brian witherow thanks matt as matt briefly touched on earlier first quarter represents less than  of our full year net revenues given the seasonal nature of our business the majority of our revenues realized during  to day timeframe beginning in our second quarter most of our revenue is concentrated in the peak vacation months of july and august and in recent years that has been supplemented with growing amount of revenue stemming from our popular activities surrounding the halloween season and more recently with our winterfest celebrations our first quarter results were slightly softer than our internal expectations due to the droughtcorrecting rains in california however with the success of our spring time events in april were now slightly ahead of where we expect it to be for this time of year net revenues for the three months ended march   were  million compared with  million in the first quarter a year ago the decrease was primarily driven by the timing shift of the eastern spring break holidays which occurred in the first quarter of  as well as a decline in the first quarter attendance due to the record rainfall in southern california to a lesser extent  also did not have the benefit of the super bowl events we hosted in january of  at our californias great america amusement park looking at preliminary results through the end of april which as matt indicated normalized due to the calendar shift associated with the later timing of easter and spring break early season net revenues were  million up  or  million when compared with the same fourmonth period last year we are pleased with the early season strength in our average inpark guest per capita spending which is up  while at the same time being able to maintain our record attendance levels we experienced during this time last year looking at longer lead indicators for a moment our advance purchase commitments including season pass sales group event bookings and the sale of all season products such as all season dining and all season beverages are trending up from the same time last year this positive momentum is reflected in our deferred revenues which are up approximately  through the first four months of  when compared with the same period last year operating cost and expenses for the first quarter totaled  million comparable with the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations i should note operating cost for the first quarter include normal off season operating maintenance and administrative expenses at our seasonal amusement and water parks and daily operations in knotts berry farm and castaway bay before i turn the call back over to matt i would like to give a nod ph to our corporate finance and corporate legal teams who along with our banking partners help solidify our capital structure for the next several years as many of you have seen in the beginning of april we announced the completion of  billion refinancing which included the issuance of  million in new tenure senior unsecured notes a new year  million term loan and a new year  million revolving credit facility we were very pleased with both the favorable rates and tenure we were able to secure which locks in historically low rates for a longer period of time our average cost of debt going forward is expected to remain inside of  with our nearest term maturity being a revolving credit facility in  for modelling purposes cash interest cost are expected to be between  million to  million for the foreseeable future overall were very pleased with our results of april and the early season trends in our advanced purchased commitments which puts us on pace to deliver our eighth straight record year last friday we celebrated  years of trading on the new york stock exchange since going public in april of  our focus has been and always will be on optimizing the use of free cash flow to maximize unit holder value in both the short and longterm this includes making strategic high roi capital investments at our parks in continuing to grow our distribution which currently represents an attractive tax advantage yield of approximately  this strategy has allowed us to operate through several recessions while still delivering a  compound annual total return to investors over this year period we believe were well positioned to continue that success for the foreseeable future now ill turn the call back over to matt matt ouimet thank you brian as youve heard from us today early trends and advance purchase commitments guest spending and attendance through this past weekend all support our positive outlook for the year and our confidence that we will achieve our  million adjusted ebitda goal in  we also expect new investments will contribute to top line growth over the longterm in  you will see more example of investments that will add to our bottom line in the current year and for the years to come notably this includes the recently opened amateur sports facility at cedar point based on tournament registration todate were forecasting the number of teams participating in this first year will easily exceed our first year expectations equally important the comments from the players coaches and parents confirm this is absolutely one of the finest amateur sports experiences in the country with teams already making plans to return in  much of the credit for the successful launch of the sports complex goes to our operating partner sports force they have delivered a worldclass facility and now had matched it uncompromised commitment to operating excellence when cedar point opens this weekend we will also be opening our recently renovated expanded and rebranded cedar point express hotel this investment will enhance the peel of the park as a regional resort destination for many years to come and the additional  rooms will take advantage of the demand from the new sports complex ive already mentioned a very successful opening kings island had with their new world class wooden roller coaster mystic timbers we are equally pleased with the guest response to patriot a new coaster experience at californias great america similar to rougarou at cedar point in  we took an older less popular stand up roller coaster and converted it to a floorless coaster this ride conversion is extremely cost effective adds capacity and is highly marketable were excited about the potential it represents at great america this year as i mentioned earlier at our two largest park cedar point and knott berry farm were making sure the adjacent water parks deliver the same quality guest experience as their counterparts do we know that water parks have broad family appeal we design the parks for all ages and we have found over the years whenever we invest in water parks we see a direct correlation to the growth of our premium season passes along with the expansion and renovation of resort accommodations at cedar point the water park allows us to further expand our geographic draw for those guests looking for multiday vacation given the large scale of these projects we were able to incorporate elements specifically design to encourage and accommodate expanded guest spending most notably our food and beverage facility are now centrally located are capable of high volumes and have expanded menus on another front at worlds of fun our park at kansas city missouri weve opened the latest of our modern catering facilities which service our growing group business we also took the opportunity to create a welcoming and efficient front gate experience with a nod to the parks history and unique brand in regards to our multiweek seasonal events weve received an impressive response to our indiscernible to the operating season at three more parks this year  kings island carowinds and worlds of fun with winterfest celebrations while difficult to isolate were confident the announcement of these events has served as a catalyst for our favorable season pass sales at these parks im proud of decisions weve made to drive our business in  and were confident this will be another record year for cedar fair well we are laser focused on  construction has already begun on multiple high impact tractions that will come online in  as we look to build on cedar fairs history well adding to our collection of world class coasters including a completely new type of coaster a dramatic transformation of two of our historical wooden coasters and a renewed relationship with a manufacturer who we have worked with recent history that will add another coaster and deepen our pool of ride manufacturers it is this type of innovation that will allow us to continue to grow beyond our near term goals in any given year the three primary drivers of our top line performance are appeal of new attractions the products we offer in the parks that encourage incremental spending and the effectiveness of our marketing and sales programs well weve have talked in depth today about the first two drivers i dont believe weve given enough credit to the impact of our multiyear marketing campaigns that have driven so much of our recent success we continue to move forward with our branding initiatives will be founded and embracing the heritage of our unique brands and strategically operationalizing ph those brands lead to a guest experience unmatched by other generic amusement parks weve now completed an in depth brand analysis six of our  amusement parks as weve discussed in the past this analysis directly informs our investment strategy works across all departments and functions and supports strong consumer loyalty for example our branding work at californias great america is referenced on a daily basis as we move forward with our longterm strategies as park now that the rezoning has been approved we see many opportunities positioned as park as the bay areas backyard and a place for family and friends look together and connect on a regular basis during all times the year finally as a result of our branding initiative and as our ecommerce platform continues to grow we are introducing new websites across all of our parks most are already up and running with all parks sites expected to be updated with the new format by the end of this month our new park websites that are greater visual design which we believe creates an impactful first impression and enhance guest engagement these new sites allow us to have targeted conversations depending on the individuals interest and family dynamics this in turn allows our guest to quickly sort to the offers most relevant to them i encourage all of you to visit some of these sites yourself including cedar point canadas wonderland and carowinds with that we now open the call for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions well take our first question from james hardiman with wedbush securities james hardiman the  revenue growth lets forget about the first quarter but focus on the first four months because its little bit more normalized of a number it still sounds like you think that number would have been better in the absence of some bad weather earlier in the quarter i guess put another way it kind of sounds like you expect that  to accelerate over the remainder of the year or im not looking it at the right way matt ouimet yes i think youre looking at it the right way james we had a really strong april and so given what we saw in the first three months in california which i appreciate the acknowledgment that its only indiscernible park at that point i think that we are very pleased with what happened once the weather normalized and obviously this indiscernible with the calendar shift as well james hardiman got it and then obviously you guys dont give guidance in most years but weve essentially got guidance with this  million matt ouimet yes weve kind of consolidated that at this point i understand james hardiman exactly so i guess i was wondering as i think about at least call it  growth in that adjusted ebitda number for this year it seems very doable but how should i think about the various components anything you can tell us attendance versus per cap versus margin expansion i know some years you have to call inaudible based on what you see as the season develops but sort of high level how do you think about those various levers this year matt ouimet james i think i would say to you that our expectation is probably very similar to where we ended up last year i think were working really hard to be able to grow attendance at the same time as you grow per cap and squeeze a little bit of margin out as well as you know the margin is important to us but we tend to reinvest substantially and the guest experience to continue to drive a premium per cap but id say if i elevated all the way up this year i think our expectations would be similar to what we saw last year james hardiman got it and then lastly from me its hard enough to figure out the revenue impact of the easter shift but maybe help us a little bit with the cost impact im assuming that most of the park you still have to have the operating expenses in place even if easter is getting pushed out i guess i ask more with respect to trying to figure out how to model q in the margins and maybe there is a benefit in q where is it was a headwind in q anyway to think about how will that flow through brian witherow james this is brian i think you hit on it a little bit there with calendar shift clearly theres some variable cost that are associated with the attendance that moved along with that calendar shift that said the majority of the parks are in there as we said on the call sort of in there preparing for the upcoming season so the dollars those dollars sort of reside where they reside there is not a lot of shift associated with that as i mentioned on the call we didnt host super bowl events this year like we did last year so there was a little bit hit for the revenue line related to that but at the same time some cost savings at great america now offsetting that however were some cost associated with taking down the winterfest events if you will at great america as we prepare for that parks opening late first quarter so all in all i would say operating cost little bit of savings related to the loss of attendance at knotts berry farm because of the weather and some of the calendar shift but mostly of our downtime costs are going to stay where they reside irrespective of the calendar james hardiman but is it safe to say that margins were hurt in q and will benefit somewhat in q from the easter shift brian witherow the dollars are so small i wouldnt say it really had any meaningful impact one way or the other around  as it related to margins james hardiman okay got it thanks guys operator operator instructions well take our next question from chris prykull with goldman sachs chris prykull just had a couple related to some of the longer term initiatives that youve outlined maybe starting with the sports complex up at cedar point and understanding its still early given the park itself isnt open but can you give us any details in terms of what youre seeing around turnout at the new sports complex average number of teams the number of players and then the guest that they actually bring along with them and then any expectations for sort of hotel and park attachment once cedar point opens matt ouimet chris this is matt good talking to you look ill give you some broad kind of feedback on that but its so early we really dont have any metrics that well be comfortable giving you the model but look were very encouraged by what weve seen the awareness and demand for the complex is ramping up a lot faster than we anticipated we got lot to learn as i referenced and so were not going to talk about attendance and hotel forecast what i can tell you is sports force released publicly recently that theyre forecasting more than  teams in the initial year and keep in the mind the majority of these teams come from outside ohio and we believe that the associated attendances from the teams as well as their entourage is largely incremental as if they werent at this complex theyd probably be playing ball at some other complex so were out of the gates good what i also add is that were inactive i would almost characterize them as late stage negotiations and other complexes like this they are public financing supported and so therefore they take a longer time to put together and they had a little uncertainty associated with it but weve got couple others that were looking at hard and we just launched feasibility studies that two of our other parks relative to this so i think you can read through that there are early season indications is that this is going to be successful metric for us well have a lot more for us as we get into the peak playing periods of july and august chris prykull great thats really helpful thanks and then on the next one i just had on group catering i know you have expanded different certain parks can you just remind us what group represents as a percentage of either annual attendance or revenue and then can you give us any read on the impact from the expansions to group bookings for  brian witherow yes sure chris this is brian as it relates as we said on the call when you put together season pass group bookings that are date or time window specific and then the advance purchases on the web through our ecommerce portal were looking at more than twothirds of our attendance as prebooked or advance purchase commitment associated group fits in season pass is the biggest chunk of that weve probably stated it last year that ended somewhere around mid  so  or so group slots in lower than that but its probably on average across the system going to be in the midteens maybe if some of the parks as highest  of our attendance were pleased as matt said on the call season pass were about  through the full year sales cycle on hotel reservations and group bookings were little bit earlier in their cycles but the early trends on group bookings todate are ahead of last year which was a strong year for us so were encouraged by where we are at this point matt ouimet chris the other thing is the investment in the catering facilities and these hiring of executive chefs have allowed us to drive up the per cap that we get from that business and thats one of the reasons you see we  be able to continue growth per cap chris prykull thanks thats really helpful if i can just squeeze one more in can you give us an update on the potential opportunity and sort of what the planned investment might be at santa clara and then how quickly you plan to move on the opportunity i know its still early though matt ouimet no i appreciate the acknowledgement that its early doesnt feel early in our offices and richard would acknowledge that were meeting almost daily on great america so actively and aggressively working on our plan what i can tell you is i would expect to be able to have more specifics for this audience when we produce our new longterm plan either later this year or early next year so at this point we still  were dug in hard on it we need to develop the plan we need to develop the phased plan and all of the things that go with it so very complicated site which in the end makes it very valuable and so i think you can expect more out of us when you see the new longterm plan either later this fall or early next year chris prykull thanks so much good luck into the summer operator and well take our next question from steve wieczynski with stifel steve wieczynski so wanted to go back to the rain impact that you talked about it knotts in the first quarter and im not sure if you had this number or you have an estimate do you know what the actual impact was on attendance at knotts and then i guess the second part to that is im not sure if you said this or not but have you seen announced a nice bounce back in attendance at knotts in april once weather essentially normalized matt ouimet yes so we wont give you a number for rain because that would be i think that would be a little bit more like speculations at this point and by the way im not talking about weather this year unless i have to what i will tell you is i did have in my prepared comments knotts had a record april a record april on attendance a record april on revenue a record april on per caps and so there was no doubt my mind anyway that once the dust cleared that park is still performing extremely well its unusual for us to give you as much data as we did about april but you can go back and see the acceleration in april if you look at the numbers from the first quarter versus the fourth month numbers we gave you steve wieczynski okay got you and then the second part i think you talked about the inpark caps were up about  through april if i heard you right and i was wondering if you could break that down a little bit more in terms of what folks are actually spending on i guess the better way to ask that is is there been any surprise in terms of of what folks are spending on this year relative to last year brian witherow this is brian were not going to give specific detail around the per cap what i will tell you is that were pleased with the trending that were seeing across the channels not only at the admission line but also through the inpark spend fb merch etc one of the things that is driving some of the admission per cap increases the pricing increases that weve taken at the front gate that we continue to believe weve got tailwinds as well as the deepening penetration rates on some of the all season programs and quite honestly a migration to up in product selection by the guests matt mentioned the introduction of or the renovation and expansion of our water parks at two of our largest parks cedar point and knotts berry farm that is a big driver for people migrating up from what we call regular passes through either platinum or gold so you get access to those water parks so everything is working on that front and were pleased with the per cap numbers in each one of the channels but its very early its a small sample size steve wieczynski okay great thanks guys appreciated operator and our next question will come from tim conder with wells fargo securities tim conder couple here brian just more of a housekeeping item any quantification you can give us on the super bowl benefit to q  just from a comparable perspective brian witherow hi tim as we said last year while it was exciting to host those things and have the folks see the park and be part of the super bowl  it was not a meaningful or material number we said at the time it was in the low singledigits in terms of its contribution at the revenue and ebitda line tim conder okay fair enough and matt again i appreciated it from the earlier question that its still early as far as post of the rezoning in santa clara but and appreciate also the uniqueness of that park with lot of i think significant infrastructure related planning where should we see i mean should we see something late this year early next year as far as literal construction and changes starting at santa clara and again youll give more details when you gave the longterm outlook matt ouimet no yes youll actually see activity later this year in fact there is some i know for a fact theres some construction stakes already in the ground out there so youll see that start to ramp up later this year tim tim conder okay and then on other initiatives here hotels you all talked before charlotte toronto being potentially some top targets here working with the potential flagged partners just an update as to where that stands at this point in potential timing as when we could hear some announcements on those matt ouimet yes so brian is helping to lead this but ill tell you were in the red zone were at the final stage of the development committees that approve these deals for the brands and so i would hope by the next time we got together we would have the announcements for you theres something it can always be a delay but were in the red zone as cleveland football players like to say i guess or football fans like to say so next time we get together we should have an announcement on that tim tim conder okay sounds good and then i know hopefully the cleveland fortunes will turn around in the not too distant future the football team matt ouimet there is always next year tim tim conder augmented reality some inpark opportunities there that you talked about before just an update augmented reality versus vr and you evaluate both it tend to  it sounds like to be leaning a little more towards augmented based on some prior comments matt ouimet yes so augmented will be in place again at cedar point this year its expanded we found a way to gamify it to a greater level and so ive got  i think were going to have even more guests enjoying it this year and it got very high ratings last year and weve also introduced i believe its kings dominion right so at kings dominion we also have introduced it and well experiment it over the course of the year and refinance ph im a big fan of augmented reality because it has literally unlimited capacity for utilization and has the ability to make the park experience more fun ill tell you the most impressive thing ive seen with digital technology this year is what we did with mystic timbers the idea that you can take a high capacity ride thats highly marketable that has broad appeal and added bell and whistle at the end of that ride that was extremely marketable we got our video post the first time we posted the video on opening day or i guess it was media day on facebook it got  million hits and a lot of that was because of the intriguing story line and the bell and whistle associated with the technology at the end so you continuously see us playing what we call techtainment but right now im excited about high capacity rides that just give a little bit bell and a whistle tim conder okay great best of luck for the season here gentlemen operator and our next question will come from tyler batory with janney capital markets tyler batory so matt i want to go back to a comment you mentioned earlier i think you said season pass revenue was up  did i catch that correctly and then can you talk about how season pass sales have compared to your expectations and whats driving that strength matt ouimet i did say  combination of units and prices it is i can tell you pacing it had where we planned for the one thing that also i think you have to take into consideration is and i know somebody comments this morning in one of their reports water parks we tend to see it another spike in season pass sales after the water parks open so those people who are waiting for kind of catalyst of the message around water parks are another opportunity for us from a season pass standpoint but you did pick up on the metric correctly tyler batory okay great and then maybe just a followup i do have a few questions for you on the water park expansions at knotts and cedar points how does return ph outlook or made the potential growth expectations for those expansions compared to a new coaster and then maybe can you remind us per capital margin difference between a water park and a theme park maybe last just talk about how those expansion can potentially drive attendance just as we look into  here matt ouimet so ill ask brian to build on what i say but generally we found and weve done this several times at this point richard has been the advocate for this that water parks i said in my comments had broad appeals the nice thing about a water park is that any age of family can experience the water park and enjoy the water park number one number two is people tend to see themselves using the water park almost more than they use the hard ride parks so it drives season pass disproportionately and in order to get access to the knotts water park and the cedar point water park you have to buy the gold pass which we are actually seeing a nice shift in people to more premium passes so thats kind of the catalyst for it and knott candidly it was a little bit about adding capacity because the peak summer months there have been so successful for us but brian you want to talk about what traditionally was true about per caps in water parks and what weve done to try to address that brian witherow yes sure tyler i mean you hit on a big part of the motivation behind the upgrades weve been making to our water parks including these two big expansions at cedar point and knotts berry farm traditionally water parks have lower per cap spend than an amusement park and its really a combination of a couple of things one i mean you dont its not easy that youre running around with your wallet for buying while youre at the water park so maybe more importantly is length of stay tends to be a little bit shorter and so i think what you find often is that and we were guilty of this that a number of our water parks you sort of anticipate that youre going to have a low per cap spend and then the facilities including fb merch etc you sort of build accordingly and its selffulfilling prophecy weve gone in as a big part of these expansions has gone back into the water park and tried to put back in place more soft areas for folks to sit more shade more umbrellas more cabanas more revenue centers big part of the expansion at both cedar point and not its about adding more fb and revenue generating centers to drive better per cap so when you combine that with as matt alluded to clearly there is going to be an uptick in daily tickets but a big part of the season pass play is getting guess to migrate as i said earlier from regular passes to gold or platinum those premium passes to get access to the water parks and so you put that together with the parks like cedar point where there is so many hotel rooms over  hotel rooms youre looking at also added length of stay as a whole second day visit and so thats where the returns really get generated at on these projects matt ouimet tyler i just built a little bit we for a while now wanted to expand the geographic reach particularly at cedar point and the renovation of our hotels along with the dramatic expansion of the water park give kelley our cmo the right kind of assets to build into marketing messages so if you live a little further away from cedar point youre going to start to see some marketing messages that we think are going to be productive for us tyler batory okay thats great thats all from me thank you operator and next well hear from barton crockett with fbr barton crockett i wanted to choose a bad time dive into the water parks theme a little bit more in particular its kind of percolated into a bigger issue i guess for the group partly with what you guys are doing partly six flags is been talking about indiscernible some water parks adjacent to their theme parks in some of the major metros where they operate and have done one thing in the northern bay area couple hours north where you north of california indiscernible park and i was curious you guys are doing something its really kind of working on a water park attached to theme parks and now experience cedar point what do you think about the opportunity to add water parks that are separate from your theme parks maybe within an hour or so and maybe have more than one water park in a metro area do you see an opportunity there what do you think about that matt ouimet not an area of focus for us barton crockett okay and its not an area of  so i was curious about why six flags professed some interest and just dont think its an attractive return or matt ouimet barton why dont you ask them because i think we got a little different play books weve been very successful where weve been successful is acquiring parks that are family owned where we were able to go in and use our units as the mlp units work very productively so any ma in our front would be if any of these parks and there is only a handful left that would meet our brand standard if they became available obviously we would be attracted to that side of it barton crockett okay all right and then switching gears a little bit you guys have called out a little bit about april which is great but since were kind of parsing indiscernible and i wanted to understand the eastern attack a little bit better and we were estimating that could have been  attendees and i was wondering if you could comment on whether that seems like a reasonable estimate and then if you do the math and what you guys said your april was up  but if we normalize for easter what was kind of the core trend there do you think brian witherow yes barton this is brian were not going to give specifics around attendance numbers related to easter or the q shift what makes a little bit more challenging to get a pure read through the fact that the one part with meaningful first quarter operations knotts berry farm was so negatively impacted by the record rainfall in southern california to start the year that said i would characterize the way this season has developed as we said in our prepared remarks by the time we get to end of april and things are normalized in terms of calendar shift we were little bit ahead of where we thought we would be we feel really good about that still have a little bit of work ahead of us when it comes to things like season pass sales were only  through but we feel really good about where we sit at the end of april and so whatever calendar shift existed whether it be easter or the spring break holidays thats all behind us and were in a good place heading into the core season barton crockett okay and then just a little bit on more on the bookkeeping side but can you give us an attendance figure for the first quarter and can you also kind of parse that looks like your effective guest spending per capita was about  through april whether and the attendance was flattish whether the per cap spending was the trend was similar for admissions revenue in food and beverage or whether there was some difference there matt ouimet because its small sample size barton were not going to give the attendance or break down the per cap it just the only park thats really active of note up to april is knotts and so we just we traditionally havent done that brian witherow and as it relates to the per cap barton as we said earlier pleased with what were seeing across all of the core spend areas admissions per cap doing well out the chute but as is fb spend and merch spend you know as two other example so feel really good about where we are at but again as matt said small sample size lot of work ahead of us barton crockett okay thats all clear and congrats on the great start to the year operator operator instructions well take our next question from michael swartz with suntrust michael swartz just wanted to touch on winterfest and you have three new programs launching this year so can you help us just understand the typical ramp of those festivals and maybe just the associated intensive i guess marketing spend at least in the first year and maybe how that evolved as you look down the road two to three years out matt ouimet probably less detailed than youd like but let me tell you how were thinking about it because quite honestly we only have the experience of one winterfest so far right so first i would say that were going to take these events to scale which means were spending a fair amount of capital and operating cost to make sure that the first year experience is what you might typically find in your threeyear or four and that worked extremely well for us at great america so thats number one number two is we do assume that the first year the margins are somewhat suppressed because of the marketing awareness launch that will have to happen associated with it but so then if you build off that will you think wed moderate that overtime and would grow our attendance overtime and so our expectations for the first year are good i would say our expectations for the third year are very substantial michael swartz okay thats helpful and just with the sport center it sounds like attendance and registration trends are better than what would you have anticipated and i think previously you had indicated that you didnt expect a lot of benefit this year from a financial standpoint so whether you can update your thoughts around just how this could impact attendance profitability in  matt ouimet this is a hard one for us michael because we try to be the guys that produce the results and then talk about it and so im little nervous here because im excited about it i got to be honest with you the communities rallied behind at the organizations sports force has really over delivered for us i cant give you any numbers yet the only i said that was publicly out there was at least  teams and you can kindly do some math around that and then were off to see how well we do at capturing these people and how many times they visit and what their per caps are and where they stay in the hotels etc so i dont mean to frustrate you but i think well have a lot more to talk about by the time we get to our second or third quarter call michael swartz okay thats fair thats all from me thank you operator and our next question will come from tim conder with wells fargo securities tim conder just a quick followup here brian i dont know if you were just saying that you still got a lot ahead of you but just had a little more work to do on season passes so did you see any deferral out of q and even maybe just because of the overall timing shift and weather or is that fully normalized as far as the season pass bookings and then the fb passes and so forth brian witherow yes sure tim its a good question i think when you look at deferred revenues at the end of q youll see exactly what you just alluded to from a timing perspective the shift of the easter and spring breaks not only pushed attendance into the second quarter it also pushed some of our marketing our crm efforts out of q into q there is no point in hitting the consumer when theyre not ready to be buyers in a large part some of the spring sales around season pass and the related season pass products like all season dining and all season beverage are specifically tied to that first visit so there is no doubt the q numbers are going to reflect a little bit of that timing shift and then were back to and thats why we spoke specifically about where we were in terms of deferred revenues being up  at the end of april through that first four months because we believe weve normalized matt did allude to and i think its something to just reemphasize that with the big capital at cedar point and knotts berry farm geared around water park expansions there is definitely marketing efforts crm efforts that will be specifically tied to pushing past sales that have yet to hit because were not going to hit consumers in april for a product that doesnt open until memorial day at the end of may so you can expect we will expect to see another little bit surge of sales around those passes at those two particular parks as we get closer to the product coming online matt ouimet and tim you didnt asked us but building on that although there are several factors in play some of the largest growth in season pass on a percentage basis are the three parks where were now introducing winterfest tim conder okay and related to all that to just to clarification so  of your season pass tickets are sold and those are up roughly  you said the fb part you said was attracting up yearoveryear should we think of that as attracting in line with the ticket season pass related matt ouimet i would tell you that its greater than that and ill leave at that tim conder and you would anticipate acceleration also when the water parks open there matt ouimet yes and i think whats really encouraging is that our all season products continue as more and more people get exposed to them as we change the programs a little bit were seeing most importantly an increase in penetration so season passes are going up thats a volume issue if penetration is going up you get a multiple factors that relates to the all season product tim conder okay gentlemen thank you for the additional color very helpful operator it appears there are no further questions at this time now i would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks matt ouimet so first of all thanks as always for your interest in ongoing support of cedar fair in closing its always important for me to acknowledge our leadership team
