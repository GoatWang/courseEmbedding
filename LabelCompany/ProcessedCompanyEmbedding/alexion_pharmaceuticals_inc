since  alexion has been a supporter of healthcare research and quality studies at duke university for aspirin and clopidogrel trade name plavix alexion received us food and drug administration fda approval for soliris in  it was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria a rare blood disorder in  there was an outbreak of hemolyticuremic syndrome caused by enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehec in germany soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome an illness similar to the one caused by the ehec infection as a result alexions german subsidiary provided an unspecified number of soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it in april  alexion was added to the nasdaq a group composed

as its new ceo acquisitionsedit in  alexion purchased proliferon inc a san diego california based developmentstage biopharmaceutical firm for us million in alexion stock alexion ceo leonard bell cited proliferons ability to produce an unlimited amount of antibodies as the reason for the acquisition at the time proliferons annual revenue was about  million and its assets were valued at  million the company has since been renamed alexion antibody technologies inc in december  alexion acquired montrealbased enobia pharma corp for  million upfront and up to another  million later contingent on company sales and regulatory goals the  million includes  million in bank debt enobia is the developer of asfotase alpha a drug used to treat the genetic disorder hypophosphatasia in may  alexion announced plans to purchase the lexington firm synageva biopharma a maker of rare disease treatments run by exgenzyme executive sanj patel who negotiated an  billion stockandcash deal in the deal each share of synageva which is traded on nasdaq will be exchanged for  in cash and  shares of alexion stock the price represented more than a  premium over synagevas market cap at the time it also represents a valuation of about ten times projected peak sales double what is typical for the biotech industry analysis by the wall street journal suggested the large premium was due to the perceived value of rare disease treatments which usually are very expensive when compared to treatments for more common diseases alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position the rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims due to small population sizes of patients and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition alexion said it expects to save  million in costs by the end of  by combining with synageva it does not expect revenue and earnings per share to increase until  the deal would give alexion a total of eight drugs in clinical trials and  others in preclinical trials synagevas main drug kanuma could receive approval in the

combat rare diseases since the targeted user base is small for such drugs clinical drugs tend to be quicker and cheaper than those for mass market drugs additionally big pharmaceutical companies have tended to ignore these markets creating a niche with minimal competition for alexion insurance companies have generally been willing to pay high prices for such drugs since few of their customers need the drugs a high price does not significantly impact the insurance companies outlays the success of specialty drugs for rare diseases comes at a time when the traditional drug business of selling medicines to the masses is in declinespecialty drugs have gotten more expensive than anyone imagined solirisedit main article eculizumab alexions first drug soliris used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome ahus and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh it has been approved for use in canada the european union japan and the united states however availability in canada is limited in canada access to the drug is mostly through private clinics groups such as the canadian association of pnh patients are lobbying to change that the drug costs roughly  a year and is considered the worlds most expensive drug the price of the drug is so high that very few individuals can pay the price as a result alexion hires public relations firms to help families institute campaigns to pressure their governments to pay for the drug alexion is putting pressure on to governments to receive their payments from the public purse the prices charged have a very high margin above the cost price in addition much of the research for the development of soliris originates from publicly funded universities there is an ethical question as to the pricing of the drug and the ethics of the drug manufacturer alexion is well on the way to developing a second very high price and high margined drug in september  the fda officially approved the use of soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolyticuremic syndrome in both adults and children more than half of people with ahus end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organsorgan failure usually involving the kidneys caused by uncontrolled complement activation the fdas decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of pediatric nephrology at atlantas childrens hospital calling it the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease by  soliris was considered to be the most expensive drug in the world it costs £ per year for treatment in the uk and  a year in canada and us a year in the united states  in the case of the rarest diseases that afflict fewer than  people biotech companies who own the only approved drugs to treat those diseases can charge pretty much whatever they want before testing soliris for pnh alexion tested the drug for rheumatoid arthritis which afflicts  million americans the trials failed but if it had worked for arthritis alexion would likely have had to charge a much lower price for this use as it would have to compete against drugs that cost a mere  alexion started selling soliris in  making  million in  with its stock price rising to  in  in april and may  a controversy arose in belgium when the media revealed that the government had refused to pay for a sevenyearold boys treatment because soliris was too expensive the boys medicine cost  euros every two weeks on may   de standaard reported that a press relations pr agency working for alexion had helped the boys parents communicate their story to the press it was also reported that the parents had believed their benefactor was a dutch organization for patients and that the pr agency acted with permission from alexion several politicians stated that the company was attempting to blackmail the government charges which alexion denied by may   an agreement had been reached to reimburse the medicine pharma the belgian pharmaceutical industrys association opened an internal investigation into the affair for possible breach of the associations ethical standards by alexion however on june  alexion received a court gag order against pharma preventing it from communicating its investigation at the same time pharma opened a court case against alexion pharma belgium the gag order was revoked by the end of september  but the case was still pending in march  strensiqedit in october  alexions second drug strensiq asfotase alfa was approved by the us fda it is used to treat hypophosphatasia a rare metabolic disorder kanumaedit kanuma which alexion acquired in its acquisition of synageva was approved in  to treat lysosomal acid lipase deficiency a fatal genetic disorder that cause fatty material to build up in blood vessel walls the liver and other tissues alexion estimates that the drug could eventually have annual sales of more than  billion financialsedit in   alexions sales originated in the us down from  the previous year  came from europe down from  japan accounted for just over  revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for soliris up  and a decreased average price related to rebates in europe acquisition related costs fell significantly from  million to just  million rd spending reached a record high of  million in  up  from the previous year when soliris was first approved peak annual sales were estimated at  million however by september  quarterly sales of soliris topped  million sales during the first quarter of  were just over us million and are still on the rise before the synageva purchase announcement alexion was valued at  billion the stock is up roughly  in the last five years and is currently trading at  times estimated earnings due to the niche

condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care
