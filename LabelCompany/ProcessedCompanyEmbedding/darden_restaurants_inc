inc  lake ellenor drivepo box orlando florida usa company perspectives we take pride in providing a terrific dining experience to every guest every time in every one of our restaurants that is how we will be the best company in the casual dining industry now and for generations history of darden restaurants inc operating more than  units throughout the united states and canada darden restaurants inc began its existence in  as the worlds largest fullservice restaurant organization occupying the casual dining niche between fine dining and quickservice restaurants specifically the company was spun off from general mills to its stockholders as an independent company overseeing the restaurant chains red lobster the olive garden and until late  china coast founded in  and acquired by general mills inc in  red lobster grew to become the nations largest seafood and casual dining restaurant chain launched in  the olive garden became the largest chain of casual but fullservice italian restaurants china coast was an unsuccessful ethnic restaurant chain that operated during the s darden restaurants two newest concepts bahama breeze and smokey bones bbq sports bar were introduced in the late s and together had  restaurants in operation by  controlling nearly  percent of the  billion casual dining market darden restaurants served approximately  meals per year through its restaurant outlets the first red lobsters in the late s william b darden reared in waycross georgia opened at the age of  a depressionera waycross lunch counter that he called the green frog promising service with a hop he went on to own some local motel and hotel properties and all or part of about  howard johnson restaurants inspired by the great popularity of seafood in two of his eight restaurantsone in orlando and the other in jacksonvilledarden opened his first red lobster restaurant in lakeland florida in  its manager was joe r lee a native georgian who later became chief executive officer of darden restaurants darden wanted to market a chain of moderately priced familystyle fullservice seafood restaurants he chose to open in lakeland because it was as far from the ocean as possible in florida and he wanted to test his concept outside of coastal areas the first red lobster proved a booming success so much so that darden and his partners had to work full shifts to meet the objective of getting food to the table within ten minutes of the order by  there were three red lobsters in operation all in central florida and two more under construction the three units which despite their name specialized in the fried fish and hush puppies favored by southerners averaged  each in annual sales and earnings were solid but the company lacked the cash to grow for general mills a diversified food products giant acquiring red lobster inns of america made sense because general mills fish sales accounted for about  million of revenue or oneninth of its total sales darden was hired to oversee the chain and open a restaurant headquarters in orlando he later became a general mills vicepresident and senior consultant retired in  and died in  general mills upgraded red lobster into a midpriced seafood dinner house that was a model of corporate efficiency lee who rose to become president of red lobster in  carried a slide rule with him everywhere in the early s to calculate prices and portion weights and to quantify whatever else could be quantified he also carried a thermometer in order to assure that entrees had been cooked to the proper temperature before being served in  red lobster established an inhouse department for purchasing seafood on a worldwide scale the company also established long before the rest of the industry a computerized pointofpurchase system to track how much of any given item was selling where rapid growth in the s red lobster grew in each year of operation and it grew rapidly by the end of fiscal  there were  restaurants with total sales of  million and by the end of fiscal  there were  with sales of  million when lee was named president of red lobster in  there were  restaurants with  employees in  the general mills subsidiary opened a microbiology laboratory in orlando to ensure the quality of its products red lobster ended that fiscal year with  units in  states and total sales of  million because of higher costs attributed in large part to increased fuel bills for truck transportation and fishing boats caused by the arab oil embargo of  red lobster again felt the need to upgrade in the mids it carpeted the floors restyled the interiors and added a few fresh dishes to its predominantly frozen menu and it sharply jacked up prices to pay for the improvements the strategy worked by the end of  red lobster with  units and almost  million in annual sales had reached ninth place among fastfood companies and accounted for more than half of total sales by seafood fastfood companies although a sitdown chain frequently with lounges it was considered fast food by some analysts because most entree items were delivered frozen alternatively however by  red lobster was rated as the nations largest dinnerhouse restaurant chain this being the name for a restaurant offering table service and a full lunch and dinner menu with an average annual return on invested assets of  percent before taxes it was one of the most profitable chains in its field and its growth had come entirely without franchising wider choices in the s red lobster provided general mills with  million in operating earnings during fiscal  by early  there were  establishments in  states the first of dozens of franchised red lobsters in japan opened in tokyo in  and the first canadian unit opened in  securities analysts attributed the chains success in large part to red lobsters position as the only nationwide seafood dinner chain and its extraordinary qualitycontrol measures according to one of its executives while seafood could be  days old and still legally sold as fresh red lobsters seafood although frozen was fresh frozen at five regional warehouses each with a qualitycontrol laboratory during  however red lobster decided to pursue a new direction the chains research according to lee indicated that its customers resented waiting in line yet did not like being hustled out and wanted a more casual dining experience with an atmosphere conducive to drinks appetizers and finger food to share instead of massive entrees accordingly a prototype unit opened in kissimmee florida in  was a grazers delight with a seafood bar serving up oysters shrimp clams calamari and other appetizers with drinks and a glassenclosed grill where fresh seafood was broiled over mesquitewood flames red lobster restaurants had deliberately been built without windows so that diners would not take up time seeking a table looking out but the new unit had picturesque views waiters were instructed to relax instead of speeding diners through the dinner cycle in  general mills authorized a  million remodeling program for red lobster the largest capitalspending item in the parent companys history all  units were to be overhauled with the menu  percent longer to include such items as seafood salads and pastas and six or eight fresh fish entrees available twice as many as in the past dinner prices were lowered to draw more customers with the expectation that patrons would make up for the difference by increased spending on appetizers and alcoholic beverages red lobster continued to reinvent itself and reward its parent company in subsequent years passing  billion in north american sales during  by then it was general mills second largest revenue producer trailing only the cereals division and accounting for about onefifth of the parent companys business a food industry analyst told the new york times they have a concept that works extremely well but they also constantly refresh their franchise  if cajun food is hot theyll put five cajun entrees on the menu whatevers hot theyll do it by this time red lobster was offering more than  seafood items every day to supply its units it was buying about  million pounds of seafood every year combing the worlds oceans for the latest novelty these included popcorn shrimp caught off the shores of brazil slipper lobster from thailand and pacific orange roughy a whitefish from new zealand to supplement north american standbys from florida stone crab and maine flounder to alaska salmon by  red lobster was purchasing seafood from  countries the array of options allowed the chain to draw in new customers by featuring bargain specials close contact between the chains buyers and thousands of entrepreneurial fishing operations and delivery by overnight air express services enabled much of the catch to reach units daily while still fresh the price of red lobster dinner entrees ranged from about  to  in  lunch entrees ranged from about  to  red lobster also offered a lowerpriced childrens menu questionnaires and focus groups also convinced red lobster of the importance of good service to securing followup trade it held a fourday training course for servers before each restaurant opened and then required the staff to attend followup monthly classes after  waiters and waitresses were encouraged to display individuality in serving customers rather than relying on mechanical recitations of what the restaurant had to offer the uniform of shirts and slacks was replaced by a maroon apron under which servers wore clothing of their own choice they also were motivated by red lobsters reputation for good benefits flexible hours chances for advancement and the hope of earning more than  in tips on good nights the olive garden  fearing saturation in the seafood market however general mills had decided years earlier to expand its restaurant group which included york steak house as well as red lobster in  following five years of painstaking research and about  million for development funds the company opened the first olive garden restaurant in orlando by the end of  there were eight such units and by mid there were  making it general mills fastestgrowing business and probably the fastestgrowing major chain in the united states a  forbes article found the dinner portions averaging only  enormous but called the salad soggy with dressing the chicken bland and the fettucine alfredo like something out of a tv dinner the public however flocked to these outlets average sales per olive garden were  million that year compared with  million for red lobster and both were high for the industry the olive garden ended fiscal  with  million in sales and  outlets it reached the billionayear sales mark in  the menu in  included not only italian specialties such as veal piccata baked lasagna and chicken marsala but a variety of veal beef and seafood dishes dinner entree prices ranged from about  to  and lunch entree prices ranged from about  to  a limitedmenu olive garden cafe concept in food court settings at regional shopping malls was being tested there were seven such units in late  illfated china coast  the success of the olive garden encouraged general mills to expand its ethnic food format after three years of development and test marketing the restaurant group launched china coast in  as the first national chinese food chain this eatery opened with an eightpage menu in newsweeks words about as long as the list of emperors in the ming dynasty the interiors were festooned with bamboo paper lanterns and chinesecharacter wall scrolls and the servers wore chinesestyle jackets eventually the china coast chain grew to  but it failed to thrive and was ordered closed in  during fiscal  china coasts sales came to only  million and wall street analysts estimated that it lost  million that year thirty china coast restaurants were converted into red lobsters or olive gardens forming darden restaurants in  general mills decided in  to spin off its restaurant operations into a new company so that it could concentrate more on its consumer food products lee the

had been accounting for only onequarter of general mills operating profits while absorbing half of the companys capital spending for expansion and renovation nevertheless its market capitalization of  billion made it second in size only to mcdonalds among the nations publicly traded restaurant companies darden restaurants indicated in early  that the china coast experience would not keep it from trying other ethnic formats in march of that year it began test marketing bahama breeze caribbean grille with a menu drawn from spanish french african dutch indian and american influences entrees priced between  and  were to include bahamian conch chowder slowroasted ribs caribbean paella jerk chicken and rumglazed yellowtail dolphin washed down with caribbeanisland beer and other drinks lee predicted that whether bahama breeze went into operation or not darden restaurants would add at least two chains to its repertoire by  darden restaurants executives expressed confidence that they were on the right track toward longterm robust growth casual dining according to the company was the fastestgrowing segment of the fullservice restaurant market with sales increasing at more than twice the

rap sheet darden restaurants by philip mattera darden dominates the fullservice restaurant sector with more than  locations that serve more than  million meals per year its olive garden and red lobster restaurants can be found throughout the united states though the company has announced plans to sell the latter chain the company also operates smaller chains such as longhorn steakhouse and capital grille outside the us dardens presence has been limited to a few dozen companyowned locations in canada and similar numbers of franchise outlets in asia and the middle east it is also beginning to expand into various parts of latin america darden which has some  hourly employees has been embroiled in numerous controversies over its labor practices and is a leading foe of workplace reforms such as paid sick days in october  hedge fund barington capital group launched an effort to force the company to split in two two months later facing poor financial results darden gave in to the pressure and announced that it would spin off or sell its red lobster chain while also halting expansion of the olive garden chain and refraining from new acquisitions barington and another hedge fund starboard value are pressing for more aggressive restructuring darden nonetheless announced plans in may  to sell only red lobster more changes are expected in the wake of a successful october  move by starboard to  replace dardens entire board of directors the green frog the company traces its roots back to  when william darden opened a lunch counter in waycross georgia called the green frog bill darden went on to open other eateries but it was not until the late s when he started to build a string of moderately priced seafood restaurants in florida that those efforts began to have a significant impact his red lobster chain was a roaring success and attracted the attention of food giant general mills which bought the company in  bill darden remained in charge after the acquisition but it was his successor joe lee who spearheaded the growth of the chain using assemblyline methods like those employed at the companys fast food counterpart mcdonalds looking to expand its restaurant segment general mills launched an italianstyle chain called olive garden in  despite negative reviews of its menu olive garden was a hit within a decade it had some  outlets and more than  million in annual revenues in  general mills decided to spin off its restaurant operations so it could focus on consumer food products joe lee named the new company darden restaurants in honor of the red lobster founder darden subsequently introduced new chains such as bahama breeze caribbean grille and in  it acquired rare hospitality inc operator of the longhorn steakhouse chain and the upscale capital grilles darden brags that in the s its founder took the bold step of welcoming diners of any race in his restaurants located in the south but the company has adopted somewhat less enlightened practices in more recent years especially with regard to its employees these practices have prompted protests at the company’s annual meetings in recent years wage and hour disputes for more than a decade darden has been accused of using various means to shortchange its workers on their paychecks a practice known as wage theft in  the company agreed to pay  million to more than  current and former servers at red lobster and olive garden outlets in california to settle a lawsuit claiming that the restaurants violated state labor regulations by preventing workers from taking required breaks and by requiring them to purchase and maintain their uniforms three years later darden disclosed that it had paid  million to settle two classaction lawsuits alleging that it had violated california law in requiring servers and bartenders to make up for cash shortages at the end of their shifts also in  darden reported that it had paid  to settle another california suit claiming several types of wage and hour violations including a failure to provide itemized wage statements and timely pay when an employee was terminated in  following a us labor department investigation that found workers were not being paid for all their hours darden agreed to pay  in back wages to  current and former servers at an olive garden in mesquite texas  the company was also fined  that same year the company consented to pay  in back pay and was fined  in connection with a similar federal investigation at a red lobster in lubbock texas in the wake of the two texas cases suits were brought against darden in several other states for example in early  restaurant opportunities centers united roc united filed a class action case on behalf of darden workers at the companys capital grille restaurants for technical reasons the action was later divided into separate actions in five jurisdictions all are still pending an even larger legal challenge to the company came in september  when a class action suit was filed in federal court in miami on behalf of all current and former employees back to  at five of dardens chains the  named plaintiffs in the case stated that the company did not pay them for the period between the beginning of their shifts and the time customers began to arrive thereby forcing them to do prep work off the clock darden was also accused of failing to pay timeandahalf for those working more than  hours per week and for improperly applying the lower subminimum wage for tipped workers when they were engaged in nonserving tasks the complaint in the case  which described the company as having a steadfast single minded focus on minimizing its labor costs by arranging to have as many tasks as possible performed by as few employees as possible  also alleged that two of the named plaintiffs had suffered retaliation from management because of their participation in the case as of october   approximately  current and former darden servers had joined the suit which is pending darden is one of the large companies that pay workers with debit cards a practice that has generated controversy because of the onerous fees often imposed by the card issuers darden is among the employers that have been contacted by the new york state attorney generals office which is conducting an investigation of the practice    employee benefits in anticipation of the affordable care acts penalties on large employers that do not provide health coverage for fulltime workers darden switched more of its workers to parttime status in  but it later abandoned that plan in the face of criticism   discriminatory practices and racial and sexual harassment the roc united wage theft actions against capital grille also allege that the chain has engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination including the denial of betterpaid server and bartender jobs to nonwhite workers in  the us equal employment opportunity commission announced that dardens bahama breeze chain would pay  million to settle allegations that managers at its restaurant in beachwood ohio had subjected  black workers to repeated overt racial harassment in addition to the monetary relief the chain signed a threeyear consent decree requiring it to improve its antidiscrimination practices throughout the country in september  the eeoc filed suit against red lobster alleging that female workers at its restaurant in salisbury maryland have been subjected to pervasive sexual harassment according to the agency the harassment was committed by a manager whose superior was said to have failed to take prompt action on the matter despite complaints from at least one of the affected workers   tipping issues in february  darden announced that it would require servers to share their tips with bartenders and busboys the move was seen as a way for the company to reduce its labor costs by subjecting more workers to the subminimum wage for tipped workers in the wake of an internal revenue service ruling that automatic tips such as those that some of dardens restaurants apply to larger groups would be treated as wages and thus subject to payroll taxes the company is reportedly considering ending the practice in december  darden announced that it would do away with the percent automatic gratuities it was adding to parties of eight or more     lobbying activities darden has also sought to lower its labor costs by becoming more active in the public policy arena until  darden spent less than  a year on federal lobbying beginning in  that amount jumped to well over  million annually in  the company hired veteran corporate operative robert mcadam to be its senior vice president of government and community affairs he previously worked for walmart and the tobacco institute mcadam joined the board of the american legislative exchange council alec the organization that writes corporatefriendly legislation frequently adopted by conservative state legislators darden was later one of dozens of companies to leave the group  the company remains a prominent participant in the national restaurant association nra where mcadam is a member of the board of directors the nra has promoted policies that enhance dardens bottom line it has opposed living wage initiatives worked to keep the minimum wage for tipped workers at  an hour where it has remained since  and resisted efforts by labor groups to enact mandatory paid sick days often by promoting state laws that preempt local ordinances on the issue darden is reported to have helped write the preemption bill in florida darden ceo clarence otis personally lobbied against a california bill designed to penalize large companies whose workers have to depend on medicaid for their healthcare coverage the company nonetheless highlights the fact that it has been included in fortunes list of the best companies to work for the legitimacy of that listwhich is produced by an organization the great place to work institute which sells consulting services to the companies it rankshas come under question hygiene issues although darden emphasizes its commitment to food safety the company has faced a series of incidents involving food poisoning  for example in  an outbreak of salmonella that affected about  persons including one who died was tied to a red lobster in chattanooga tennessee in  more than  people who had eaten at an olive garden an indianapolis suburb were reported to have experienced gastrointestinal illness several employees tested positive for norovirus the company later settled a class action lawsuit linked to the incident for  in  officials in cumberland county north carolina advised persons who had eaten at an olive garden in fayetteville during an eightday period to get a hepatitis a shot because a worker at the restaurant had tested positive for the disease darden settled a lawsuit linked to the incident by establishing a  fund out of which those who had been immunized would each receive  in the summer of  the us food and drug administration linked prepackaged salads from mexico served at olive garden and red lobster restaurants in iowa and nebraska to an outbreak of the stomach virus cyclospora that affected several hundred people consumer protection in  darden settled federal trade commission allegations that it deceived consumers in the sale of gift cards by failing to disclose adequately the dormancy fees that would be subtracted from the value of the cards after a period of nonuse in addition to improving its disclosure practices darden agreed to refund fees that had been charged the ftc did not announce the total cost of the refunds but darden had reported that the agency was proposing a figure of  million in  dardens olive garden chain settled a class action alleging that it had violated federal law by printing the last six digits of customer credit card numbers on receipts rather than the legal limit of five digits the settlement consisted of  appetizer vouchers sent to about  affected customers   tax avoidance and subsidies in  following what it claimed was a nationwide search for a new headquarters location darden decided to stay in orange county florida after negotiating at least  million in state and local economic development subsidies for new offices the total included a  million qualified target industry tax refund and a  million economic development transportation fund award because darden’s corporate income tax liability was not large enough to take full advantage of the state credits it had been offered in  the company began lobbying the florida legislature for the right to apply the credit to its sales tax liabilities instead the change was said to be worth about  million a year the legislature adopted the change but specified that it would begin only after  years darden has sought to further reduce its property tax payments by challenging the appraised value of the furniture and equipment in its

estate portfolio a move starboard said would greatly boost shareholder value matters came to head when management announced a plan to spin off the underperforming red lobster early in  starboard led a large group of investors in asking management to delay the move and see if better options such as its plans to revitalize the chain were available when management instead decided to sell the chain to private equity firm golden gate capital in may starboard and other investors sharply criticized the  billion fire sale price as a serious undervaluing of red lobster and its assets such as the underlying real estate it also claimed management had refused shareholders requests for a special meeting to discuss the deal chief executive officer clarence otis jr announced he would be resigning

chains wasteful practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once to prevent food waste due to staleness instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chains corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did management responded two days later that it was already implementing many of the suggested changes and said the free breadsticks merely represented italian generosity nevertheless in october shareholders replaced the entire board with starboards slate in what an observer called an

chains wasteful practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once to prevent food waste due to staleness instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chains
