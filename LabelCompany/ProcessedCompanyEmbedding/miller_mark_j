media reviews goetz sofa design mark goetz molded veneer upholstery metal legs made by herman miller® i try to give things a reserved quiet expression so theyre appropriate in a variety of environments but i also try to make interesting forms that people really like something fresh and new mark goetz molded plywood carries an immediate association with classic herman miller designs and mark goetz skillfully and creatively incorporates this material in his sofa design while traditional construction consists of a wooden frame with padding and upholstery applied over it the goetz sofa turns tradition inside out since its plywood shell is clearly visible as both an aesthetic element and a structural frame the sofas practicality extends to one of its most important featurescomfort goetz conducted his own research and consulted with other experts to arrive at a seat depth that gives ergonomic support as well as room to lie down by using common materials and processes in innovative ways designer mark goetz achieves a clean crisp aesthetic the goetz complements contemporary informal lifestyles while echoing herman millers classic heritage the goetz sofa features a dramatic profile with molded veneer which wraps completely around the sides and back with polished cast aluminum legs the frame finishes include walnut white ash natural cherry or ebony veneers the upholstery is available in your choice of a wide range of fabrics and leathers  w   d   h  seat  h   free threshold delivery in the continental us usually ships in  weeks reviews   there are no
