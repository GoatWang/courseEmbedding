fiction writer thus you will find no weapons or nasty robots in her book she has not pursued a career that at first glance would lead to science fiction she has been a hospice chaplain for eight years and in  published true stories she heard while on the job in encountering the edge what people told me before they died penl publishing after that she decided to use gentle science fiction including a decidedly friendly robot companion to show how a retro couple in the future would confront spiritual issues such as privacy regrets and getting more out of life by being curious her fans who could “enjoy” a book about hospice assuredly will find this one far more entertaining yet thoughtprovoking just the same read more if you buy a new print edition of this book or purchased one in the past

someone who enjoyed karen kaplan’s “encountering the edge” her memoir of seven years as a hospice chaplain i looked forward to “curiosity seekers” and was not disappointed she takes clever ideas and puts unconventional characters in amusing situations curiosity seekers is a collection of five stories set in our future featuring the quirky ackermans full disclosure i’m thanked in the acknowledgements for retweeting karen kaplan more than anyone else i appreciate her thanks and after reading curiosity seekers i remain a fan“escapade“ introduces homer and muriel ackerman in the year  both with their own ways of “hunkering down into the past” homer and muriel are a middleaged contrarian happily longmarried couple who trade gentle quips during their zany adventures homer restores books in an age where printed books have become scarce replaced by “quantumbooks” muriel creates greeting cards intended for one person which she insists are to be hand delivered through one of homer’s clients they discover the existence of a group of “opting outers” people who shun email ecommerce and other modern technologies the ackermans plan an exploratory visit to these seemingly likeminded folks and hijinks ensue i enjoyed kaplan’s take on the observer’s paradox the act of observing causes changes to that which you observe the ackermans effect unexpected change in the opting outers despite their efforts to fit in i also noticed the observer’s paradox in the second and fifth stories“a dementia returnee” explores the case of a friend of the ackermans virginia boyden who is among the first to be successfully treated for dementia in the year  both this story and the next share some themes with the much lauded novel “flowers for algernon” though with a much lighter tone the story comments on how we treat people with cognitive impairment and imagines the experience of someone recovering from the condition kaplan’s insight as a hospice chaplain enriches the story and her compassion and skill at listening also shine through“flowers for ackerman”  the protagonist in this story uses technology to try to forget something heshe wants to avoid processing the story explores and comments on what our relationship with technology could become and reminds us of how that relationship has and will change i enjoyed kaplan’s humorous take on the matter and it’s my favorite story“gomer gone wayward” includes a flashback to a time when gomer was asked to restore a book with troubling content and introduces the ackermans’ niece beatriz who was “similar to gomer and to muriel always in pursuit of curiosities”“fighting to listen” continues beatriz’s story in  and relates her family’s adventure on the first mobile city that breaks out of orbit beatriz notes that “we might be more like the opting outs than we care to think they were a small community with little outside contact sound familiar” kaplan’s masterful use of recurring themes strengthen the book and enriched my enjoyment of it“curiosity seekers” encourages you to look beyond what you know and experience an optimistic future with imaginative characters i finished the book sharing a bit of kaplan’s contagious optimism i’m happy that i spent time exploring with the ackermansread morecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starsa playful nipbyjulianne l wileyon march  format paperbackverified purchaseone thing i noticed is that these stories are not so much scifi as social satire and yet such gentle and amiable satire that it

that i was not a great fan of science fiction but these interrelated stories from karen kaplan changed my mind with a vengeance although full of imagination they are firmly set in reality albeit in a future agea married couple gomer and muriel volunteer for a long expedition into the future and find much to fascinate them and us along the way of especial interest to me was the initial battle between those who welcomed new technology and those who opposed the new ways i wont reveal which group seemed to gain ground in the battle but it was very much the side i felt i was on hurrayalso gripping for us today was the story of gomers and muriels friend virginia who recovered from dementia with side effects that were eventually overcome i am sure many of us will find this hopeful and hearteninga strange other race was eventually discovered this race had strange ways of communication too and the humans felt they learnt much about a different culture and gained a deeper understanding of themselves these creatures even ate and drank in a different way from us  not mixing water with food the former was sucked up into their bodies through their feeti felt it was refreshing to find ourselves in the company of a couple of human beings gomer and muriel who were warmhearted and humorous their son who accompanied them on their travels was also intelligent and civilisedtherapy played its part here and i repeat my favourite quote from this fascinating and unusual book it is better to be the last to listen than to have the last wordread morecomment  people

the story are gomer and muriel ackerman a quirky middleaged couple whose professions of book repair real physical books and creating onerecipientonly handmade greeting cards set them a bit at odds with the futuristic society they live in in gomer and muriel’s world alzheimer’s disease is a thing of the past generational space travel is possible and everyone uses something called “quantum mail”
