john deere  parts catalog deere  co jurisnotescom inc   deere  co v mtd products inc southern district of new york aug     memorandum and order   introduction defendant mtd products inc mtd or defendant moves for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to rule c of the federal rules of civil procedure on two of the five claims brought by deere  company deere or plaintiff in this trademark action the two claims which defendant seeks to dismiss allege violations of the federal trademark dilution act ftda  usc § c and the new york antidilution statute ny gen bus l §  fn for the reasons set forth below defendants motion is granted as to both claims   facts plaintiff a corporation with its principal place of business in illinois has been manufacturing and selling products in the agricultural equipment industry since the s compl   all the agricultural vehicles plaintiff has produced since the s have green bodies and yellow wheels including deeres lawn and garden tractors walking and riding mowers tillers and snow blowers id    according to plaintiff since  deeres total sales of agricultural commercial and consumer equipment in north america have exceeded fifty billion dollars id  during the same period deere claims it has spent more than five hundred million dollars in advertising and promoting such products id    deere is the owner of three federally registered trademarks pertaining to agricultural equipment dressed in a green and yellow color combination id   plaintiff alleges that as a result of its extensive advertising and sales the green and yellow color combination has become distinctive as an indication of the source of deeres products id  further deere claims that the green and yellow color combination is famous and has achieved secondary meaning in the minds of consumers id   mtd a corporation with its principal place of business in ohio is one of deeres competitors in the business of manufacturing agricultural equipment id   mtds line of agricultural equipment known as yardman includes lawn and garden tractors walking and riding mowers and snow blowers id  yardman products are also dressed in the colors green and yellow id  according to plaintiff mtd chose the colors green and yellow in order to capitalize on the goodwill established by deeres green and yellow trademarks and trade dress id    plaintiff further alleges that since its green and yellow trade dress is distinctive and has acquired secondary meaning in the minds of consumers customers are able to identify deere as the source of any agricultural or lawn and garden equipment displaying these colors id  as a result this action was brought alleging inter alia that mtds use of the colors green and yellow on its yardman line of equipment dilutes deeres green and yellow trademarks and trade dress in violation of federal and state law id    discussion  legal standard the standard for granting a rule c motion for judgment on the pleadings is identical to that of a b motion for failure to state a claim patel v contemporary classics of beverly hills  fd   d cir irish lesbian and gay org v giuliani  fd   d cir the court must read the complaint generously accepting the truth of and drawing all reasonable inferences from wellpleaded factual allegations mills v polar molecular corp  fd   d cir a court should dismiss a complaint only if it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief  valmonte v bane  fd   d cir quoting conley v gibson  us       dilution under the ftda in relevant part the ftda provides that the owner of a famous mark shall be entitled subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable to an injunction against another persons commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection  usc § c   in order for a mark to receive protection under the ftda the mark must be both famous and distinctive  usc § c tcpip holding co inc v haar comm inc  fd   d cir while acquired distinctiveness fn may render a mark protectable under other federal trademark provisions a mark must be inherently distinctive in order to be protected under the ftda tcpip holding  fd at  new york stock exchange inc v new york new york hotel llc  fd   d cir holding that a mark that lacks inherent distinctiveness cannot qualify for the protection of the ftda a mark can be considered inherently distinctive if  its intrinsic nature serves to identify a particular source  of a product walmart  us at  quoting two pesos inc v taco cabana inc  us      the supreme court has held that use of color alone cannot be inherently distinctive qualitex co v jacobson prods co  us    this rule was subsequently affirmed in walmart  us at  with respect to at least one category of markcolorswe have held that no mark can ever be inherently distinctive the supreme court concluded that color can only be protected as a trademark upon attaining secondary meaning qualitex  us at  however as set forth above secondary meaning or acquired distinctiveness is inapplicable to the determination of distinctiveness for the purposes of the ftda tcpip holding  fd at  therefore since deeres green and yellow color combination cannot be inherently distinctive as a matter of law deeres federal dilution claim must be dismissed fn   deere relies heavily upon the two pesos case in which the supreme court held that trade dress can be inherently distinctive two pesos  us at  however in two pesos which was decided before both qualitex and walmart the trade dress at issue involved more than just color id at  n  the trade dress in two pesos involved in addition to the color of the restaurant the shape and appearance of the restaurants exterior the restaurants sign the kitchen floor plan the decor the menu the equipment used to serve food the servers uniforms and other features contributing to the total image of the restaurant id in contrast the case at bar involves color alone and the supreme court has clearly concluded that color is not inherently distinctive walmart  us at  qualitex  us at  fn accordingly deeres federal dilution claim fails as a matter of law    state law dilution claim in addition to claiming trademark dilution under the lanham act plaintiff alleges that mtds use of the green and yellow colors on its yardman equipment causes dilution of the distinctive quality of deeres green and yellow trademarks and deeres green and yellow trade dress in violation of new york gen bus law §  compl  fn defendant moves to dismiss this claim on the ground that illinois law is the proper law to be applied under new yorks choice of law rules and that the illinois anti dilution statute does not permit recovery against competitors defs mem of law at    thus the court must decide whether new york or illinois law applies to plaintiffs state law claim both parties agree that a federal court adjudicating a supplemental state law claim applies the choice of forum rules of the forum state north atl instruments inc v haber  fd   d cir citing rogers v grimaldi  fd   d cir under new yorks choice of law rules in tort cases fn courts apply an interest analysis to determine which state has the greatest interest in the litigation curley v amr corp  fd   d cir krock v lipsay  fd   d cir to determine which state has the greatest interest a court must inquire  what are the significant contacts and in which jurisdiction are they located and  whether the purpose of the law is to regulate conduct or allocate loss krock  fd at  quoting padula v lilarn properties corp  nysd   nyappdiv under this formula the significant contacts are the parties domiciles and the locus of the tort id at    the second prong of the inquiry is usually addressed first in the interest analysis because if the law at issue seeks to regulate conduct then the location of the alleged conduct is determinative whereas if the law at issue concerns loss allocation the parties domiciles are the most significant contacts krock  fd at  conductregulation rules have the prophylactic effect of governing conduct to prevent injuries from occurring fn padula  nysd at  in this case the antidilution laws at issue seek to regulate conduct therefore the choice of the proper state law turns on the location of the alleged tort   plaintiff and defendant disagree as to the location of the alleged dilution plaintiff argues that because a significant portion of mtds products are sold in new york new york law should apply pls mem in oppn at  defendant on the other hand argues that mtds products are sold nationwide and that new york is only one of many locations defs reply mem of law at  while the court agrees with plaintiff that the location of dilution is where the products are sold it cannot conclude that new york law must be followed because plaintiff does not allege that new york is the only state where mtd products are sold the locus of the alleged dilution appears to be in more than one state in this case   because the locus of the conduct is in more than one state and the domiciles of the parties differ the court will look at where the injury occurred eg united magazine co v murdoch magazines distribution inc  fsuppd   sdny plaintiffs injury occurs where its principal place of business is located because a plaintiff suffers the most severe business injury in that state id applying ohio law where the allegedly tortious conduct occurred in new york new jersey illinois and possibly other states and plaintiff suffered business injury in ohio this analysis is consistent with the suggestion that where the location of the alleged tort is not apparent the tort is deemed to occur where the party resides and sustained an economic loss resulting from the tort bon jour group ltd v elanpolo inc no  civ   wl  at  sdny july   citing krock  fd at  in this case deeres principal place of business is in illinois and deere will suffer economic loss from the alleged dilution in illinois compl  thus illinois law should apply to deeres state law claim   applying illinois law to plaintiffs state law claim the claim must be dismissed because it is wellsettled  that commercial competitors cannot recover under illinoiss antidilution statute abbott labs v nutramax prods inc  fsupp   ndill citing ez loader boat trailers inc v cox trailers inc  fd   th cir deere alleges that mtd is a direct competitor compl  thus mtds motion is granted as to the state law dilution claim   conclusion for the foregoing reasons the court grants mtds motion to dismiss deeres federal and state dilution claims   so ordered   fn the first three counts of the complaint which are not being challenged in this motion allege trademark infringement under  usc §  unfair competition under  usc § a and unfair competition pursuant to new york state law   fn acquired distinctiveness occurs when a mark has developed secondary meaningthat is when in the minds of the public the primary significance of a mark is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself  walmart stores inc v samara bros inc  us    quoting inwood labs inc v ives labs inc  us   n     fn because color cannot be inherently distinctive the court need not reach the issue of whether deeres green and yellow color combination is famous   fn plaintiff additionally argues that the supreme courts holding in qualitex is limited to cases involving one color pls mem in oppn at  the court rejects this argument in light of the language in both qualitex and walmart which clearly refer to color more generally walmart  us at  design like color is not inherently distinctive qualitex  us at  discussing the use of color to serve as trademark   fn new york gen bus law §  states that likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of infringement of a mark registered or not registered  ny gen bus law §  mckinney    fn trademark dilution claims sound in tort cello holdings llc v lawrencedahl cos  fsuppd   sdny   fn in contrast loss allocation rules  are those which prohibit assign or limit liability after the tort occurs  id at  john deere  wikipedia john deere from wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search this article is about the company for

deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo iowa namely the r r and r series the company produced its first combine harvester the john deere no  in  a year later this innovation was followed up by the introduction of john deere no  a smaller machine that was more popular with customers by  the no  and no  were replaced by newer lighterweight harvesters in the s john deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a  slope gradient on an episode of the travel channel series made in america that profiled deere  company host john ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from american farmers during the great depression during world war ii the greatgrandson of john deere charles deere wiman was president of the company but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the us army a replacement was hired and before returning to work at the company in late  wiman directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the war production board in addition to farm machinery john deere manufactured military

company’s first modern fourcylinder and sixcylinder tractors during a day packed with hightech presentations live demonstrations and a parking lot full of brandnew green and yellow machines the line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making and the event itself took months to plan deere chose dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the  guests and the equipment they were all there to see the dallas memorial auditorium the texas state fairgrounds coliseum the cotton bowl and the cotton bowl parking lot were each the

dealers and introduced the new tractors hewitt told the guests they were about to see a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor since entering the tractor business in  john deere had focused on twocylinder machines the new generation of power introduced at deere day in dallas was very different from anything deere had built before the new line of four and sixcylinder tractors the models    and  were more far more powerful than deeres twocylinder models and also easier and more comfortable to

john deere and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the united states although the  which was available with deeres optional power shift enjoyed greater popularity the  moved john deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology in addition to the advanced engine technology the  series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older twocylinder models they replaced including significantly higher horsepowertoweight ratio advanced hydraulics more convenient and comfortable operator stations and many other improvements of the  series john deere tractors introduced in  the  was by far the most popular with more than  units sold

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo iowa namely the r r and r series the company produced its first combine harvester the john deere no  in  a year

hillsides with up to a  slope gradient on an episode of the travel channel series made in america that profiled deere  company host john ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from american farmers during the great depression during world war ii the greatgrandson of john deere charles deere wiman was president of the company but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the us army a replacement was hired and before returning to work at the company in late  wiman directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the war production board in addition to

respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor since entering the tractor business in  john deere had focused on twocylinder machines the new generation of power introduced at deere day in dallas was very different from anything deere had built before the new line of four and sixcylinder tractors the models    and  were more far more powerful than deeres

deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor

york city for defendant mtd products inc findings of fact conclusions of law and order mckenna district judge plaintiff deere  company deere initiated this action by filing the complaint along with an order to show cause seeking a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order on april   plaintiff alleges that the actions of defendant mtd products inc mtd in broadcasting or causing to be broadcast the television commercial at issue violate section  of the lanham act  usc § a and the new york antidilution law nygenbus law art  § d mckinney  and constitute unfair competition and unjust enrichment under the common law of new york plaintiff contends that the jurisdiction of the court arises because the litigation raises a question under federal law specifically the lanham act  usc §  et seq because there is diversity of citizenship of the parties and the amount in controversy is greater than  and on the basis of supplemental jurisdiction see  usc §  and  usc §§   a b and a after a hearing held on april   the court denied plaintiffs application for a temporary restraining order on april  and   a hearing was held on the order to show cause for a preliminary injunction for the reasons set forth below plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction is granted i a plaintiff deere is a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in illinois for more than  years deere has been in the agricultural equipment industry and is nationally and internationally famous for both its agricultural equipment and its lawn and grounds care products deere has used a leaping male deer design as a trademark for identifying its products and services for over one hundred years since  the current version of the leaping male deer logo the deere logo has been used in some form on or in connection with substantially all of its products and services as well as in advertisements and promotional material for those goods and services deere is the owner of numerous trademark registrations both in the united states and throughout the world for different versions of the deere logo the versions vary in numerous respects including the use or absence of a border or frame and the use or absence of the name john deere what the trademarks have in common is the substantially identical static twodimensional silhouette of a leaping male deer in profile facing to the viewers left see nolan aff mar   nolan aff i exs ab nolan aff apr   nolan aff ii exs ew deeres net sales of equipment bearing the deere logo for the fiscal year ending october   exceeded  billion of which more than  billion were in the united states in each of the fiscal years  and  deere spent more than  million advertising its agricultural industrial and lawn and grounds care products and services using the deere logo in the united states deere has budgeted a similar amount for the same purpose for fiscal year  in addition deere has spent a substantial amount of money in advertising and promoting its products using the deere logo outside the united states the deere logo has been an important part of deeres marketing efforts for more than  years plaintiff maintains that the deere logo is one of the most recognizable logos in the world wood aff ¶  through its widespread use the deere logo has according to plaintiff achieved a secondary meaning in the marketplace and has become a business asset of immense value to deere and represents substantial goodwill to deere compl ¶¶   accord pls reply br further suppmotpreliminj at  deeres leaping deer logo is enormously distinctive and enjoys extraordinary secondary meaning by virtue of its use in connection with various goods and services for more than  years plaintiff considered and rejected the idea of animating the deere logo harries aff ¶  and has never given anyone else permission to animate it b defendant mtd is an ohio corporation with its principal place of business in ohio mtd manufactures inter alia lawn tractors and mowers the instant action revolves around a commercial advertising mtd lawn tractors — specifically the yardman lawn tractor line — produced for mtd by wb doner  company doner which at the time this action was commenced had served as mtds advertising agency for three years at the april   hearing defendant presented a revised version of the original commercial with two significant changes  the addition of visual text superimposed below the version of the deere logo used in the commercial that reads this is a trademark of john deere and not affiliated with yardman see facsimile copy of storyboard storyboard defs ex o and  a change in the voiceover so that what was heard in the original version — the yardman doesnt run for nearly as much money — was changed to the yardman doesnt cost nearly as much money see videotape of updated and original versions of commercial videotape pls ex  see also tro hrg tr  the courts denial of plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order entered at the april   hearing was made with the understanding that from that point forward only the revised version of the commercial would be broadcast see tro hrg at  it is this revised version of the commercial the commercial that is at issue in this action the commercial had its genesis in a november   memorandum from david demuth vice president and management supervisor of doner in charge of the mtd account to john parlato creative director at doner demuth asked parlato to oversee development of a commercial comparing the yardman line of lawn tractors to a more expensive but otherwise comparable brand of tractor demuth specifically suggested that the comparison be made to deere lawn tractors see mem from david demuth to john parlato nov   demuth affex a at some point in the evolution from a general suggestion to a more defined commercial concept the idea of animating the deere logo was born on several occasions demuth and another doner employee one l wickenden solicited the opinion of bryan yolles executive vice president general counsel and chief administrative officer of doner as to the legality of such a commercial see eg mem from l wickenden to bryan yolles oct   pls ex  expressing concern about possibly disparaging the competition at the bottom of the letter which asked yolles to review the proposed storyboard and script for the commercial is the following handwritten note approved bryan jay yolles  oct  mem from david demuth to bryan yolles undated pls ex  asking for review of storyboard and referencing previous conversations on the issue of whether to use the actual deere logo or an altered version of it and indicating that demuth would follow up with yolles by telephone mem from bryan yolles to david demuth jan   pls ex  approving the use of the actual john deere logo as long as the commercial indicates that the logo is a registered trademark of the john deere company sic yolles ultimately approved the commercial based on the storyboard the script and his discussions with demuth because yolles believed it was permissible to animate a competitors logo see yolles test transcript of april  and   preliminary injunction hearing pi hrg tr at  despite yolles admonition to use the actual john deere logo mem from bryan yolles to david demuth jan   pls ex  doner concededly altered the static logo actually found on deere tractors for use in the commercial in addition to the inserting the registered trademark symbol in the bottom righthand corner outside the logo a change — if it can be called that — which yolles himself suggested doner removed john deere from the version of the deere logo used by deere on the front of its lawn tractors a change yolles concedes that he approved see pi hrg tr  see also mem from david demuth to john parlatojudy wittenberg dec   pls ex  describing need to alter version of the deere logo found on its lawn tractors because that version has the words john deere beneath the symbol and changed the shape of the boundary making it more sharply rectangular than the actual deere logo see nolan aff ii at  plaintiff also contends that the leaping deer design in the commercial appears to be a somewhat distorted version of deeres leaping deer design trademark even before the deer design is animated in the commercial id the court agrees that the deer in the commercial appears to be somewhat differently proportioned particularly with respect to its width than the deer in the deere logo compare storyboard defs ex o with nolan aff ii ex i in addition of course the animation of the static deere logo — a detailed description of which follows — alters the static logo at least to the extent that considering the commercial from a framebyframe perspective the commercial places the deer in myriad poses different from the pose it strikes in the deere logo of greater significance and concern to plaintiff is the fact that the deer is made to move — to look behind it to run to jump to change direction — something the static deere logo obviously and by definition does not do a description of the completed version of the commercial including the revisions incorporated just prior to the april   hearing follows the commercial begins with a full fronton shot of a john deere lawn tractor on the front of the tractor is the commercial logo the next shot is a full screen closeup of the commercial logo in the lower righthand corner of the commercial logo outside the border is the symbol indicating a registered trademark a capital r with a circle around it below the commercial logo is the text this is a trademark of john deere and not affiliated with yardman see storyboard defs ex o videotape pls ex  the voiceover that accompanies the first three cuts of the commercial states a very expensive maker of lawn tractors likes to say nothing runs like em see storyboard defs ex o videotape pls ex  this is an obvious reference to the deere slogan nothing runs like a deere which is a registered trademark of deere see nolan aff i ex c after a number of live action shots of the yardman tractor cutting a lawn accompanied by a voiceover description of some of the tractors features another closeup of the commercial logo appears — this time without the registered trademark symbol in the lower righthand corner the deer inside the commercial logo springs to life through animation turning its head toward the viewer in order to look behind it to the viewers right — presumably to see the yardman tractor bearing down on it the deer turns and faces forward again to the viewers left lowers its head and jumps forward again to the viewers left through the left vertical border of the commercial logo which breaks into pieces and tumbles toward the ground the deer lands in a live action shot of the lawn and continues throughout the commercial to be superimposed onto live action footage the deer begins to run with the tractor in pursuit a closeup shot of the tractor is accompanied by the voiceover so it runs like a youknowwho only it doesnt cost nearly as much money see storyboard defs ex o videotape pls ex  the deer still moving from right to left runs past a leashed dog the dog is of a breed which although unspecified in the record is recognizable as being a breed that is short in stature the dog barks or snaps at the deer which changes direction and runs away from the dog the deer continues to move from right to left but in a way that makes it appear as if the deer is moving toward the viewer before it disappears into the lower lefthand corner of the screen after a shot of a stationary yardman tractor flanked by two yardman lawn mowers with a voiceover that states yardman american made american owned there is a final shot of the deer now dwarfed by the yardman tractor running left to right with the yardman tractor in pursuit the commercial was submitted to abc nbc and cbs for clearance by the legal staffs of those networks prior to their running it all three networks sought and received substantiation of the claims made in the commercial defendant has provided copies of the substantiation it submitted in support of the commercial see demuth affexs d d and d nbc approved the commercial outright abc approved the commercial with the following handwritten proviso please be reminded abc has the right to reevaluate this commercial should there be a responsible complaint see demuth affex d cbs approved the commercial after demanding and receiving a letter of indemnity from doner even though according to defendant it is standard practice for a buyer of media time contractually to indemnify the network and therefore doner already had indemnified cbs see eg yolles test pi hrg tr  the commercial was scheduled to run and presumably did run during sports programs on major network spot market and cable television from the week of march   through the week of may   see yardman  spring advertising schedule defs ex y on march   john m nolan senior patent counsel for deere viewed a broadcast of the original version of the commercial on whbftv a television station broadcasting from rock island illinois that is associated with cbs after a flurry of communication between plaintiffs counsel and defendants general and outside counsels plaintiff commenced the instant action on april   ii at issue is plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction inter alia prohibiting further airing of the commercial it is well established that the standard in the second circuit for injunctive relief clearly calls for a showing of a irreparable harm and b either  likelihood of success on the merits or  sufficiently serious questions going to the merits to make them a fair ground for litigation and a balance of hardships tipping decidedly toward the party requesting the preliminary relief bridgeport coalition for fair representation v city of bridgeport  fd   d cir quoting jackson dairy v hp hood  sons  fd   d cir for reasons that will become clear the court limits its consideration of plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction to the contention that the commercial violates the new york antidilution statute section d of article  of the new york general business law states likelihood of injury to business reputation or of dilution of the distinctive quality of a mark or trade name shall be a ground for injunctive relief in cases of infringement of a mark registered or not registered or in cases of unfair competition notwithstanding the absence of competition between the parties or the absence of confusion as to the source of goods or services nygenbuslaw art  § d mckinney  as one commentator has explained the dilution theory grants protection to strong wellrecognized marks even in the absence of a likelihood of confusion if defendants use is such as to diminish or dilute the strong identification value of the plaintiffs mark even while not confusing customers as to source sponsorship affiliation or connection the underlying rationale of the dilution doctrine is that a gradual attenuation or whittling away of the value of a trademark resulting from use by another constitutes an invasion of the senior users property right in its mark and gives rise to an independent commercial tort dilution occurs when the ability of the senior users mark to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiffs goods or services is weakened because the relevant public now also associates that designation with a new and different source  j thomas mccarthy mccarthy on trademarks and unfair competition  mccarthy § b at  d ed  the second circuit has addressed the requirements for maintaining a claim under section d there are three elements of such a claim  distinctiveness of the mark either that the mark is truly of distinctive quality or has acquired secondary meaning in the eyes of the public  likelihood of dilution either as the result of blurring of product identification or the tarnishing of an affirmative association that a mark has come to convey and  predatory intent www pharmaceutical co v gillette co  fd   d cir quotation marks and citations omitted settling what had been a matter of some dispute the second circuit recently held that section d is applicable to competitors as well as noncompetitors nikon inc v ikon corp  fd   d cir iii plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success on the merits on its antidilution claim and moreover has demonstrated it will be irreparably harmed if injunctive relief is not granted a plaintiff has shown a likelihood that it will be able to succeed in satisfying the three required elements of a dilution claim pursuant to section d  defendant does not dispute plaintiffs contention that the deere logo in its many manifestations satisfies the distinctiveness requirement outlined in gillette the court finds that because the deere logo is the kind of strong and distinctive mark that is capable of dilution and because it has acquired the requisite secondary meaning in the marketplace see mead data central inc v toyota motor sales usa inc  fd   d cir citations omitted the deere logo satisfies the first element of the gillette test quoted supra the issue of likelihood of dilution is a more difficult one traditionally the second circuit has defined dilution as either the blurring of a marks product identification or the tarnishment of the affirmative associations a mark has come to convey mead  fd at  citing sally gee  fd at  quoting a r callman the law of unfair competition trademarks and monopolies §  at  the interest protected by § d is not simply commercial goodwill but the selling power that a distinctive mark or name with favorable associations has engendered for a product in the mind of the consuming public sally gee  fd at  citations omitted in an attempt to identify the harm the statute is meant to prevent the majority in mead referred to the brief legislative history of the statute which suggests that the purpose of the statute is to prevent the whittling away of an established trademarks selling power and value through its unauthorized use by others upon dissimilar products the legislative history discloses a need for legislation to prevent such hypothetical anomalies as dupont shoes buick aspirin tablets schlitz varnish kodak pianos bulova gowns and so forth and cites cases involving similarly famous marks mead  fd at  quoting legislative history of section d citations omitted there has been little analysis of what precisely is meant by the blurring of a marks product identification the majority opinion in mead after examining the legislative history of section d quoted supra indicated only that some mental association must exist between the plaintiffs and defendants marks see id otherwise however the mead court did not provide guidelines for determining what constitutes blurring in a concurring opinion in mead judge sweet noted that confusion in the doctrine of blurring has created problems id at  sweet j concurring and suggested that there is much to be gained by defining a general concept like blurring more specifically id judge sweet borrowing from judge friendlys multifactor balancing test for identifying confusion in the trademark infringement context articulated in polaroid corp v polaraid elecs corp  fd   d cir cert denied  us   sct   ledd   suggested a test involving the balancing of six factors  similarity of the marks  similarity of the products covered by the marks  sophistication of consumers  predatory intent  renown of the senior mark  renown of the junior mark mead  fd at  sweet j concurring the fact that defendant uses the deere logo to refer to deeres own products renders the first second fifth and sixth factors meaningless in this context leaving only the third and fourth factors which alone cannot serve as a meaningful test of whether blurring has occurred thus judge sweets multifactor blurring test is not applicable to the instant facts as the foregoing implies the instant case is one of first impression trademarks are symbols — symbols of products and their origins when a trademark is successfully employed favorable associations accrue not only to its referent — the product or source for which the trademark stands — but also to the trademark itself blurring consists of the the blurring of a marks product identification mead  fd at  citing sally gee  fd at  quoting a r callman the law of unfair competition trademarks and monopolies §  at  to put it another way blurring involves the dilution of the relationship between the symbol and the referent blurring is typically alleged in the trademark dilution context in one of two situations  the use of an identical symbol a mark or a name for a different referent which dilutes the strength of identification between the symbol and the original referent see mead  fd at  quoting language of legislative history of section d concerning hypothetical anomalies quoted supra or  the use of a demonstrably different yet obviously similar symbol for a different referent which diminishes the distinctiveness of the original symbol and thus lessens its power uniquely to call to mind the original referent see supra note  citing cases the instant action presents a third situation a competitor animates the original static symbol the deere logo without the owners permission and uses the animated version the commercial logo in connection with the identical referent deere specifically deere lawn tractors for which the original version of the symbol was used defendants actions have in effect created a second symbol — the animated commercial logo — for the same aforementioned referent thus defendant likely has diminished the strength of identification between the original symbol and its referent the consumer may no longer associate the deere logo only with deere and its products but likely also will associate the deere logo with the commercial logo thereby blurring the deere logos product identification cf mead  fd at  and reducing the commercial goodwill and selling power of the deere logo in addition to the extent the sight or mention of a deere product triggers in the consumer the image of the deere logo and all the favorable associations accruing to it there is less likelihood of such a seamless identification between deere products and the deere logo since such a mention or sighting may now trigger the image of the animated commercial logo instead or as well one other point bears mentioning it being wellestablished that a trademark owner does not retain exclusive control over the use of his trademark it nevertheless seems equally clear if less prominent in the case law applying the antidilution statute that the holder of a trademark retains the right to prevent others from altering its static mark by animating it in order to win some competitive advantage for themselves this point rests less on the concept of blurring per se than on the motivating principle behind section d to protect against the usurpation of the commercial goodwill selling power and favorable associations embodied in the trademark which rightfully belong to the marks owner as one commentator has put it the underlying rationale of the dilution doctrine is that a gradual attenuation or whittling away of the value of a trademark resulting from use by another constitutes an invasion of the senior users property right id § b at  to permit a competitor to derive benefit from animating anothers static logo is to permit the competitor to whittle away the value or usurp the fruits of the trademark such is a harm section d seeks to prevent to summarize because a competitors animation of a static trademark without the owners permission blurs the marks product identification and moreover because such action contravenes the protective purpose behind section d such action constitutes a per se violation of new yorks antidilution statute plaintiff therefore has demonstrated a likelihood of success in showing that the commercial is likely to dilute plaintiffs trademark  plaintiff has demonstrated a likelihood of success in showing that defendant had the requisite predatory intent although the language utilized by the second circuit in gillette quoted supra appears clear it is nevertheless not settled law in this circuit whether a showing of predatory intent is required for or merely relevant to a finding that the antidilution statute has been violated the gillette court quoted the language of the court in lobo enters inc v tunnel inc  fsupp   sdny which in turn was citing sally gee  fd at  to the effect that predatory intent was a requirement for a showing of likelihood of dilution under section d continuing to trace the history of this requirement the sally gee court which as discussed supra note  merely stated that predatory intent was a relevant factor in assessing a claim under section d relied on a footnote in information clearing house inc v find magazine  fsupp  sdny  in which judge weinfeld explained that tarnishment is a species of dilution which itself is a part of the broader category of unfair competition an essential element of such a claim is proof of unfair intent of direct competition between the parties respective products or of the inferior quality of defendants product id at  n  citing inter alia gb kent  sons ltd v p lorillard co  fsupp   sdny weinfeld j affd per curiam  fd  d cir other citations omitted given this history the predatory intent requirement may be read as a shorthand reference to the factors enumerated by judge weinfeld in the kent footnote and therefore because plaintiff and defendant are indisputably competitors in the lawn tractor market plaintiff appears to have shown a likelihood of success as to this element of a dilution claim even assuming however that the plain language of gillette applies the gillette court described predatory intent as the intent by a junior user to trade on the senior users reputation gillette  fd at  citation omitted that defendants intent from the very beginning was to elevate its own position in the marketplace by associating itself with deere is uncontroverted the primary objective of the commercial is to enhance awarenesssales for yardman by positioning the brand as a superior value versus more expensive brands we believe this can be achieved via a comparison with john deere as yardman lawn tractors posses sic all the features of a deere and more in some cases at retail prices  less mem from david demuth to john parlato nov   demuth affex a b plaintiff has demonstrated that it will be irreparably harmed if the requested preliminary injunctive relief is not granted as one court has noted it would be anomalous to say that without relief plaintiffs marks would be diluted and then deny the existence of possible irreparable injury dilution is itself an injury which could not be recompensed by money damages american express co v vibra approved lab corp no cv  wl  at  sdny apr   indeed with respect to a party asserting a dilution claim it is extremely unlikely that the moving party can be fully recompensed by money damages sterns miraclegro prods inc v shark prods inc  fsupp   sdny together with the fact that plaintiff has invested substantial sums of money in advertising campaigns featuring the deere logo see supra the foregoing discussion of the generally irreparable nature of the harm associated with dilution claims leads the court to conclude that plaintiff has made a sufficient showing that it will suffer irreparable harm as a result of defendants animation of the deere logo to warrant the requested preliminary injunctive relief iv for the foregoing reasons plaintiffs application for a preliminary injunction is granted plaintiff may settle on five days notice to defendant a proposed order of preliminary injunction together with suggestions as to the amount of the bond to be furnished in addition the parties will address the court within seven days as to the time needed to complete discovery and to file a pretrial order counsel are to retrieve exhibits from chambers so ordered supplemental findings of fact conclusions of law and order on july   the court issued its findings of fact conclusions of law and order the july order granting the application of plaintiff deere  company deere for a preliminary injunction against defendant mtd products inc mtd on the ground that in broadcasting or causing to be broadcast the television commercial the commercial at issue mtd violated the new york antidilution statute nygenbuslaw art  § d mckinney  the court affirmatively declined to reach inter alia the question whether the commercial as plaintiff contends violates section a of the lanham act  usc § a see july order at  n  on august   the court issued an order the august order restraining and enjoining defendant from broadcasting publishing or distributing or causing to be broadcast published or distributed from in or into the state of new york any material deemed to be in violation of the antidilution statute as specified in the order see august order at  given that the injunctive relief granted is of a limited geographical nature the court now takes up the question whether the commercial violates section a of the lanham act familiarity with the facts as recited in those two prior rulings is assumed the standard for preliminary injunctive relief previously having been set out see july order at  and the court having already concluded that plaintiff will be irreparably harmed if the requested preliminary injunctive relief is not granted see july order at  the court now turns to the question whether plaintiff demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of its lanham act claim of false and misleading advertising as the second circuit has noted the law governing false advertising claims under the lanham act is wellsettled in this circuit in order to recover damages or obtain equitable relief a plaintiff must show that either  the challenged advertisement is literally false or  while the advertisement is literally true it is nevertheless likely to mislead or confuse consumers where as here a plaintiffs theory of recovery is premised upon a claim of implied falsehood a plaintiff must demonstrate by extrinsic evidence that the challenged commercial tends to mislead or confuse consumers johnson  johnson  merck consumer pharmaceuticals co v smithkline beecham corp  fd   d cir citations omitted such extrinsic evidence is normally constituted by a consumer survey see id at  the success of a plaintiffs implied falsity claim usually turns on the persuasiveness of a consumer survey as the court in johnson went on to explain generally before a court can determine the truth or falsity of an advertisements message it must first determine what message was actually conveyed to the viewing audience consumer surveys supply such information once the meaning to the target audience has been determined the court  must then judge whether the evidence establishes that they were likely to be misled id citations and quotation marks omitted plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that the commercial is misleading or confusing plaintiff introduced the results of a consumer survey along with the testimony of an expert who opined that the survey results revealed a high degree of confusion among viewers as to inter alia the source of the advertisement defendant did not offer a survey of its own but did provide testimony of an expert who argued that the survey results suggested that consumers by and large were not confused or misled by the commercial having reviewed the conflicting expert testimony as well as the survey and the survey results the court is not persuaded that plaintiffs interpretation of the survey results is entitled to any more weight than that advanced by defendant sufficiently serious questions as to inter alia the target audience the procedures followed by the surveytakers and the conclusions to be drawn from the answers to the questions have been raised to dissuade the court from drawing definitive conclusions in favor of plaintiff concerning plaintiffs likelihood of success on the merits on the basis of the survey results at this juncture so ordered footnotes  at the close of the april   hearing the court instructed the parties to submit to the court in writing the direct testimony of any witnesses they wished to call see transcript of hearing on application for temporary restraining order apr   tro hrg tr at  certain exceptions to this directive later were approved by the court nevertheless the hearing consisted mainly of crossexamination redirect and recross of witnesses as well as legal arguments by counsel  deere contends moreover that revenues from its financial services and insurance operations which also utilize the deere logo exceeded  billion in fiscal year   deere has also invested an unspecified sum in advertising its parts and merchandise such as oil and clothing items as well as its financial and insurance services using the deere logo see nolan aff i at   the court will hereinafter refer to this altered version of the deere logo as the commercial logo  see supra for a description of how the commercial logo differs from the version of the deere logo actually found on the front of deeres lawn tractors  plaintiff originally protested the use of this copy in the commercial reasoning that such a statement implied that deere and deere products were not also american made and american owned plaintiff did not press this claim with much vigor at the april  and   hearing perhaps because defendant presented evidence that mtd requires that the slogan american made american owned or some version of such appear in all its advertising and promotional material see eg demuth aff ¶  yolles aff ¶   representative of the substantiation is a letter provided by demuth to nbc in which demuth relies on the marchapril  issue of consumer reports to support the claim of comparable quality at a lower price demuth referring to the consumer reports study suggests that the price range for yardman lawn and garden tractors is  to  while similar deere models are priced at  to  specifically demuth points out that the yardman dg lawn tractor which features a  horsepower engine as well as a hydrostatic transmission and a mulch kit retails between  and  while the deere stx which has a  horsepower engine a gear drive transmission which apparently is less desirable than a hydrostatic transmission and which does not have a mulch kit retails for a minimum of  see letter from david demuth to dorothy busz mar   with an attached copy of letter from david demuth to dorothy busz mar   containing handwritten comments apparently made by busz defs ex u see also defs exs v w  nolan viewed the version of the commercial that ran prior to the changes made in the days leading up to the april   hearing see supra  moreover as the plain language of section d indicates a court need not find a likelihood of confusion in order to find for a plaintiff in a section d claim see also sally gee v myra hogan inc  fd   d cir   having so concluded the court need not address the other claims that are contained in the complaint and upon which plaintiff bases its application for a preliminary injunction  clearly though the instant action does not involve precisely the type of hypothetical anomalies feared by the new york legislature since defendant is using a slightly altered version of the deere logo to refer to deeres own products  to put it more accurately defendant purports to use plaintiffs own static mark and to animate it but in fact uses a close approximation of plaintiffs mark in both its static and animated portrayal of that mark see discussion supra  an examination of the cases cited by judge sweet in evaluating the similarity of the mark factor in mead brings this point into sharper focus the cases involve either an alleged similarity in names between two products of different origin see eg mcdonalds corp v mcbagels inc  fsupp   sdny mcdonalds and mcbagels universal city studios v nintendo co  fd  d cir  king kong and donkey kong tetley inc v topps chewing gum inc  fsupp   edny tetley tea bags and petley flea bags toys r us inc v canarsie kiddie shop inc  fsupp   edny toys r us and kids r us textron inc v spidell watch  jewelry co  fsupp  sdny affd in part revd in part on other grounds  fd  d cir speidel and spidell or speidell or similarity between a character that is a trademark and a character in a television program see warner bros inc v american broadcasting cos  fd  d cir superman and title character in the greatest american hero television show in addition mead — itself a dispute involving the use of the names lexus and lexis — falls in the first category of cases  neither the parties nor the court has found any case in which an entity animated its competitors static logo indeed plaintiff offers evidence suggesting that this simply has never before been done see wood aff ¶  defendant for its part argues that this case is not unique because many entities have animated their static logos see eg defs memlaw oppn motpreliminj at  citing examples however there is a vast difference between the holder of a trademark animating its own static mark and a competitor animating the holders mark without the owners permission  although as the foregoing discussion illustrates the commercial logo incorporates changes to the deere logo — even apart from the animation of the deere logo — the analysis that follows rests not on these other changes but on the fact that defendant effectively animates the static deere logo  moreover as plaintiff suggests defendants use of the deere logo is likely to blur the distinction between the deere logo and other deer logos used in the marketplace see pls reply brsuppmotpreliminj at   because of the distinctiveness and strong secondary meaning of the deere logo this sort of reverse referentiality seems likely  that this constitutes blurring finds support in the statement already quoted supra that dilution occurs when the ability of the senior users mark to serve as a unique identifier of the plaintiffs goods or services is weakened because the relevant public now also associates that designation with a new and different source  mccarthy § b at   as one commentator has noted in general the law is that it is neither trademark infringement nor unfair competition to truthfully compare competing products in advertising and in so doing to identify by trademark the competitors goods id §  at  citing cases  if as both the majority and concurring opinions in mead imply predatory intent is not a requirement for a cause of action under section d see mead  fd at  listing distinctiveness and likelihood of dilution as only requirements for claim under section d id at  sweet j concurring same then the court need not find that plaintiff has shown a likelihood of success in showing that defendant had predatory intent with respect to the use of the deere logo in the commercial however because the issue is not settled the court will address it with respect to the instant facts  the court in gillette indicated that the language of lobo which the court quoted was in turn a quotation from sally gee in fact the lobo court was merely citing to sally gee for the proposition that predatory intent is an element of a dilution claim this proposition is in itself something of a misnomer the court in sally gee merely said that the absence of predatory intent by the junior user of a trademark is a relevant factor in assessing a claim under the antidilution statute sally gee  fd at  emphasis added citations omitted  the court need not address the other two claims contained in the complaint namely that defendant violated the common law of unfair competition and unjust enrichment since the same considerations that led the court to limit the injunctive relief for the violation of the new york antidilution statute to activities originating or having an effect within the boundaries of the state of new york likewise would apply to injunctive relief granted pursuant to these two state common law claims  although plaintiff alleges some instances of actual falsehood the court upon considering all the evidence offered and all the testimony given concludes that plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its claim that the commercial is literally false  plaintiff has presented evidence that one consumer was actually confused by the advertisement the court is not swayed by the actual confusion of a single otherwise unidentified individual of unknown sophistication with respect to products of the type at issue in this case  the court in johnson enumerated a number of additional factors that a court may have to consider in connection with an implied falsehood claim namely  the general commercial context or sea of information in which consumers are immersed  the defendants intent to harness public misperception  the defendants prior advertising history and  the sophistication of the advertising audience id the johnson court explained however that the first third and fourth factors should only be considered after plaintiff has established that a not insubstantial number of consumers hold the false belief allegedly communicated in the ad id quoting cocacola co v tropicana prods inc  fd   d cir the court does not believe plaintiff has made such a showing but even had the court found otherwise plaintiff as is explained more fully infra is not likely to succeed in showing that any of the factors weighs against defendant plaintiff has not advanced any arguments concerning the first and third enumerated factors as to the sophistication of the advertising audience the court credits evidence suggesting that because inter alia a lawn tractor is an expensive item not likely to be purchased on impulse the target audience would be relatively sophisticated with respect to the relevant market and not likely to be confused by the commercial turning to the question of defendants intent the second enumerated factor the court in johnson indicated that where a plaintiff adequately demonstrates that a defendant has intentionally set out to deceive the public and the defendants deliberate conduct in this regard is of an egregious nature a presumption arises that consumers are in fact being deceived id at  citation and quotation marks omitted plaintiff has not shown a likelihood of success of demonstrating that mtd was seeking to harness or engender public misperception or that defendant deliberately attempted to deceive consumers the question of harnessing public misperception should not be confused with the issue of whether for the purposes of determining whether there is a likelihood of dilution under the new york antidilution statute defendant had predatory intent the court need not revisit what it previously described at length see july order at  and notes here that the predatory intent in the dilution context however sinister sounding does not require a finding of bad faith whereas harnessing public misperception implies bad faith on the part of the harnessor because plaintiff has not shown the presence of this element here plaintiff is not entitled to the presumption of deception comment your name your email comments  characters remaining

deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo iowa namely the r r and r series the company produced its first combine harvester the john deere no  in  a year later this innovation was followed up by the introduction of john deere no  a smaller machine that was more popular with customers by  the no  and no  were replaced by newer lighterweight harvesters in the s john deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a  slope gradient on an episode

dealers and introduced the new tractors hewitt told the guests they were about to see a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor since entering the tractor business in  john deere had focused on twocylinder machines the new generation of power introduced at deere day in dallas was very different from anything deere had built before the new line of four and sixcylinder tractors the models    and  were more far more powerful than deeres twocylinder models and also easier and more comfortable to operate with conveniently located controls better visibility and improved seat suspension these new tractors were also easier to service the  was rated at  horsepower in  but tested at  horsepower

john deere and perhaps any tractor manufacturer in the united states although the  which was available with deeres optional power shift enjoyed greater popularity the  moved john deere into the modern era of farm tractor technology and design following its successful history as a tractor manufacturer that was by the late s experiencing waning market share due to its outdated technology in addition to the advanced engine technology the  series tractors offered many other upgrades from the older twocylinder models they replaced including significantly higher horsepowertoweight ratio advanced

sound gard body this insulated cab that included a rollover protective structure had a distinctive rounded windshield and came equipped with heat and air conditioning as well as speakers for an optional radio an track tape player was also available as an option the  was replaced by the very similar  and continued in production with new generation styling until  when the  series tractors were

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president william butterworth charles soninlaw who had replaced charles deere after his death in  began the companys expansion into the tractor business deere  company briefly experimented with its own tractor models the most successful of which was the dain allwheeldrive but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the waterloo gasoline engine company in  which manufactured the popular waterloo boy tractor at its facilities in waterloo iowa deere  company continued to sell tractors under the waterloo boy name until  when the john deere model d was introduced the company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in waterloo iowa namely the r r and r series the company produced its first combine harvester the john deere no  in  a year

hillsides with up to a  slope gradient on an episode of the travel channel series made in america that profiled deere  company host john ratzenberger stated that the company never repossessed any equipment from american farmers during the great depression during world war ii the greatgrandson of john deere charles deere wiman was president of the company but he accepted a commission as a colonel in the us army a replacement was hired and before returning to work at the company in late  wiman directed the farm machinery and equipment division of the war production board in addition to farm machinery john deere manufactured military tractors and transmissions for the m tank they also made aircraft parts ammunition and mobile laundry units to support the war effort in  john deere

green and yellow machines the line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making and the event itself took months to plan deere chose dallas to host the event partly because it was home

chairman and ceo of deere  company welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors hewitt told the guests they were about to see a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor since entering the tractor business in  john deere had focused on twocylinder machines the new generation of power introduced at deere day in dallas was very different from anything deere had built before the new line of four and sixcylinder tractors the models    and  were more far more powerful than deeres twocylinder models and also easier and more comfortable to operate with conveniently located controls better visibility and improved seat suspension these new tractors were also easier to service the

detour illinois in  to escape bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi

the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president

bankruptcy in vermont already an established blacksmith deere opened a squarefoot  m shop in grand detour in  which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels small tools production was just a start the item that set him apart was the selfscouring steel plow which was pioneered in  when john deere fashioned a scottish steel saw blade into a plow prior to deeres steel plow most farmers used iron or wooden plows to which the rich midwestern soil stuck so had to be cleaned frequently the smoothsided steel plow solved this problem and greatly aided migration into the american great plains in the th and early th centuries the traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered this style was very slow as deere realized that this was not going to be a viable business model he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but also allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away word of his products began to spread quickly in  deere entered a business partnership with leonard andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new twostory factory along the rock river in illinois this factory named the l andrus plough manufacturer produced about  plows in  and around  plows during the next year deeres partnership with andrus ended in  and deere relocated to moline illinois to have access to the railroad and the mississippi river there deere formed a partnership with robert tate and john gould and built a squarefoot  m factory the same year production rose quickly and by  the deere tate  gould company was producing over  plows a month a twostory addition to the plant was built allowing further production company logo used between  and  deere bought out tate and goulds interests in the company in  and was joined in the business by his son charles deere at that time the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows including wagons corn planters and cultivators in  the companys production totals reached almost  implements per month in  a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company to prevent bankruptcy the company was reorganized and deere sold his interests in the business to his soninlaw christopher webber and his son charles deere who would take on most of his fathers managerial roles john deere served as president of the company until  the company was reorganized again in  when it was incorporated as deere  company while the companys original stockholders were charles deere stephen velie george vinton and john deere charles effectively ran the company in  charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the companys sales nationwide this same year deere  company won best and greatest display of plows in variety at the th annual illinois state fair for which it won  and a silver medal the core focus remained on the agricultural implements but john deere apparently also made a few bicycles in the scitation needed th centuryedit john deere plow  cultivators cos new orleans house  increased competition during the early s from the new international harvester company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business but the production of gasoline tractors came to define deere  companys operations during the th century company logo used between  and  in  deere  company president
