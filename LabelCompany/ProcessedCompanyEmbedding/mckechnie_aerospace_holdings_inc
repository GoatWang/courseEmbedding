today a definitive agreement to purchase mckechnie aerospace holdings inc mckechnie a privatelyowned supplier of innovative aerospace products controlled by jll partners for a total purchase price on a cash free debt free basis of approximately  billion in cash  transdigm expects to finance the acquisition primarily through a combination of senior and subordinated debt mckechnie calendar year  revenues are anticipated to be modestly above  million with ebitda margins ranging from the low to mid  of revenues  the business consists of seven major operating units that primarily sell to the worldwide commercial aerospace markets  approximately twothirds of the revenues are sold to the commercial transport oem and aftermarkets about  to the business and regional jet oem and aftermarkets and about  to the defense segment  aftermarket revenues account for roughly  of the total with the balance sold primarily to the worldwide aerospace oem markets  less than  of the revenues are to the military markets  the company employs about  employees in its various locations mckechnie has major platform positions in both the oem and aftermarket on the full range of currently produced boeing and airbus aircraft as well as a many regional and business turbine aircraft  the company also has significant content on the new boeing  airbus a and a mckechnies two largest operating units are hartwell based in los angeles california and electromechwelco based in wichita kansas  these two units account for approximately  of the anticipated calendar year  revenue and a significantly higher percentage of the total company profits  hartwell is a leader in the design and manufacture of proprietary external aerospace latches and connecting devices  electromechwelco is a major supplier of proprietary aerospace motors blowers valves and actuators mckechnies tyee business unit located in seattle washington and tac business unit located in belgium are leaders in proprietary connecting rods and also supply certain mechanical controls to both boeing and airbus  when combined these two units make up approximately  of the anticipated calendar year  revenues  additionally the specialized fastener group consisting of linread located in the united kingdom and valley todeco located in sylmar california makes up approximately  of the anticipated calendar year  revenues we anticipate that the acquisition will be primarily financed through some combination of senior and subordinated debt we have obtained commitments for the full amount of financing to execute this transaction  this will bring the total debt to approximately  billion  as the company has said consistently in the past we view our capital structure as an integral part of our value creation strategy  absent any additional acquisitions or other capital market actions transdigm should begin to delever relatively quickly  with respect to future availability we anticipate that immediately after the completion of this transaction we will have over  million of cash and undrawn revolver and under certain circumstances additional availability under our current credit agreement  in addition we have the capability to consistently generate cash well in excess of our operating and debt service needs this is the first sizable acquisition opportunity that we have seen in the last  or  years that meets our stringent strategic operational and valuecreation criteria stated w nicholas howley transdigms chairman and chief executive officer  we are excited about mckechnies wide range of complementary products and business strategy  mckechnie fits well with our consistent focus on proprietary aerospace components with broad platform positions and significant aftermarket content  the substantial majority of mckechnies revenue comes from proprietary products and the company has a significant and growing aftermarket  they have continually invested in new platforms and are well positioned for growth as the commercial aerospace markets continue to recover from the recent down cycle and the new platforms begin to ramp up these are well run businesses with operating margins  well above industry averages continued mr howley however consistent with our past acquisition history we expect to see margin improvements as we integrate the mckechnie businesses into our culture and management processes  we expect to realize cost savings relatively quickly in corporate overhead and then more gradually improve the margins as we implement transdigms value drivers throughout the organization  on a full year basis we expect the mckechnie business to achieve meaningful growth in transdigms fy  in both revenues and ebitda eps and eps as adjusted results in  will be impacted by the timing of the close purchase price accounting and the final financing details the acquisition which is expected to close before the end of the calendar year is subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions paul levy managing director and founder of jll commented having worked with great management to help grow mckechnie over the last several years we are now delivering a superior company with superb margins to a leading strategic acquiror  in addition to being a successful transaction for our investors we are proud to have transdigm recognize mckechnie as a highquality industry participant  helping companies become industry leaders has been a key part of jlls success over the past  years “i am very pleased that transdigm is acquiring the mckechnie aerospace companies” stated tariq m jesrai chief executive officer of mckechnie  “the combination of transdigm with the mckechnie companies will further add value to our mutual customers and provide stability for the employees  jll partners and morgan stanley have been exemplary partners with management in providing the environment where mckechnie aerospace companies invested wisely in capital projects and new platforms resulting in strong growth in sales profit and cash  this venture is a good example of how private equity can positively impact a companys performance by partnering with good management and sharing in the success” credit suisse and ubs investment bank acted as financial advisors to transdigm in the transaction and baker  hostetler llp acted as transdigms lead legal counsel  jll and mckechnie engaged morgan stanley as their lead financial advisor along with jefferies  company  morgan stanley capital partners was a minority investor in mckechnie  skadden arps
