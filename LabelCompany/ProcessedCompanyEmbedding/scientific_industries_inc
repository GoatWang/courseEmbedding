and services to academic and governmental research institutes and other research labs within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries the company is headquartered in the i hitech corridor in the state of maryland the core products of codexbiosolution are actone cell lines and membrane potential kits which are licensed from bd biosciences they also develop other new cell based products to meet the demands from various customers actone cell based assay technology actone technology is the key platform used by codex biosolutions for development of cell based assay for gpcr and pde it is based upon a modified cyclic nucleotidegated cng ion channel as a biosensor of camp activity in live cells this channel responds in realtime to increases or decreases in intracellular camp levels by coordinately altering cation flux eg calcium potassium or sodium which can be measured by calciumsensitive fluorescent indicators or by codex’s optimized membranepotential dye on broadlyavailable plate readers or on singlecell imagers by juxtapositioning this biosensor adjacent to adenylyl cyclase the enzyme responsible for synthesis of camp in the membrane of cells that also express the gpcr target of interest the biosensor provides ultrasensitive responses to camp fluctuations rich et al j gen physiol – the technology platform enables livecell gpcr screening or deorphanization of agonists antagonists and allosteric modulators of gs gi or gqcoupled receptors in well formats because the technology directly measures camp through cng channels it detects gpcr activity through its nature pathway no engineering or modifications to the g protein is required the assay is highly sensitivity to intracellular camp change it has excellent signal to noise ratio and high z’ value it is also costeffective and easy to use preliminary evidence has been developed that supports the ability to freeze these cell lines in readytoscreen format and for enabling receptor profiling for specificity assessment the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases pdes are enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis of ′ ′cyclic nucleotides such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp and cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp to their corresponding ′nucleotide monophosphates these enzymes play important roles in controlling cellular concentrations of cyclic nucleotides and have central roles in a variety of intracellular signaling events as such phosphodiesterases are emerging as a promising class of drug targets particularly in asthma cardiovascular and cns diseases currently pde inhibitors are identified in screens employing biochemical assays using pure substrates camp or cgmp and purified recombinant pde enzymes we have leveraged the cng channels in the actone technology to detect intracellular campcgmp changes and developed the first commercially available livecell pde inhibitor assays to measure camp specific pde activity a constitutively active gscoupled gpcr is overexpressed in the cells containing cng channels to stimulate adenylyl cyclases leading to camp synthesis the produced camp is hydrolyzed by intracellular pde so the steady camp is kept at low level upon the pde activity inhibition the cellular camp level rises quickly and is measured by the cng biosensor this assay has been used to identify inhibitors of pde in a  well format titus et al j biomol screen    to assay cgmp specific pde activity soluble guanylate cyclase sgc was stably transfected into the cells containing cng channels cellular cgmp can be increased by the sgc stimulator bay  in the presence of cgmp specific pde the produced cgmp is hydrolyzed quickly by pde so the steady level of cgmp is low by adding a cgmp specific pde inhibitor the cgmp can accumulate quickly and activate cng channels actone membrane potential dye kits actone cell lines   d dbio dbio is a life science supplier based in college park maryland usa  founded in  dbio brings high quality laboratory

nanosurface biomedical inc in vivo in vitro   nanosurface biomedical’s anfs anisotropically nanofabricated substratum technology brings an in vivolike cell culture platform to researchers for in vitro celltissue studies featuring topographical resemblance to the extracellular matrix nanopatterned substrates provide a topographical and mechanical niche for cells to grow as if they are in vivo nanopatterned surfaces influence both cellular morphology and phenotype for example when used with cardiomyocytes formation of striated sarcomeres intercalated discs and polarized expression of gap junction proteins such as cinnexin all occur phenotypically cells cultured on anfs are more mature and more physiologic resulting in more predictive reliable and reproduceable experiments    background there are many examples of how nanotopographic structures throughout tissues and organs within multicellular organisms influence cellular behavior with lithographic manufacturing technology it now is possible to precisely fabricate biomimetic nanotopographic structures within a cell culture device that produce a more natural cellular behavior within a cell population numerous in vitro studies utilizing fabricated nanotopograhic features demonstrate how biomimetic nanostructures impact cellular behaviors eg cell morphology and cell differentiation and physiology the following figure shows how cells exhibit different morphologies depending on whether or not the culture surface is flat or grooved   anfs anisotropically nanofabricated substratum technology   nanostructure with  nm
