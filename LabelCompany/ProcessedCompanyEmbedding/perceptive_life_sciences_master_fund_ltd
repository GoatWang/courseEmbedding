eastern standard time san diego  new yorkbusiness wiretang capital partners lp and perceptive life sciences master fund ltd today announced that they have delivered a letter to the board of directors of penwest pharmaceuticals co nasdaq ppco “penwest” urging the board to take immediate action to preserve shareholder value by substantially winding down penwest’s operations so that the full value of the opana er royalty income stream will be retained by penwest the text of this letter follows tang capital partners lp eastgate mallsan diego ca  perceptive life sciences master fund ltd park avenue

chief executive officervia electronic mail and facsimilepenwest pharmaceuticals co old ridgebury road suite danbury connecticut  dear members of the board of directors as reported in our filings with the us securities and exchange commission the “sec” tang capital partners lp and its affiliates “tang capital” and perceptive life sciences master fund ltd and its affiliates “perceptive” are the two largest shareholders of penwest pharmaceuticals co “penwest” or the “company” and together own  of the company’s outstanding common stock we write to express serious concerns about the current direction of penwest in the hope that you will take action before it becomes too late and we are forced to pursue other measures specifically for the reasons explained below we ask that you stop wasting corporate assets and substantially wind down the company’s operations so that we the shareholders may realize the full value of the opana er royalty income stream we also ask that you confirm that our january   notice that we intend to nominate  persons for election to the board of directors at the  annual meeting complies with penwest’s advanced notice bylaw provisions we request that you take these actions no later than march   penwest’s one principal asset penwest has one principal asset its royalty earned on the sale of opana er by licensee endo pharmaceuticals “endo” as you know opana er was launched by endo in  and had net sales in  of approximately  million million up approximately  yearoveryear net of the royalty holiday and development cost recoupments penwest will earn royalties at an effective rate of approximately  in  and  in  resulting in royalty income of approximately  million million this year and  million million next year depending on sales growth as you also know the duration for which this income stream will survive is uncertain endo and penwest recently entered into a settlement agreement with actavis south atlantic llc “actavis” that will enable actavis to launch a generic version of opana er on or after july   or earlier under certain circumstances litigation with the other firsttofile generic challenger impax laboratories inc is pending and the results of that litigation remain uncertain importantly whether one is optimistic or pessimistic about the ultimate sustainability and value of this income stream our position on what is the best course of action for shareholders does not change to put this in simple terms whether one has  or  in one’s pocket it is equally unadvisable to waste  to be clear this income stream is substantially passive and requires negligible resources from penwest according to penwest’s licensing agreement with endo dated april   and amended january   and july   penwest must supply endo sufficient quantities of formulated timerx the extended release technology for opana er the fullyburdened cost of which is reimbursed by endo furthermore at the option of penwest a contract manufacturer may be used to produce the required supply of timerx also at endo’s cost in terms of penwest’s balance sheet we estimate that there is only  million million of net cash left as of december   after last year’s spending based on figures provided in the company’s december  corporate presentation the “corporate presentation” this includes an estimated  million million in cash and cash equivalents offset by  million in secured debt due over the next  months cash spend in  was  million million or approximately  of the company’s current market capitalization according to the corporate presentation a – not worthy of continued investment we understand that substantially all of the company’s development efforts are focused on a for the potential treatment of several orphan diseases collectively referred to as mitochondrial diseases the company recently announced that it has begun a phase b clinical trial of a in which safety will be evaluated in healthy volunteers the company also announced that it has initiated longterm animal toxicology studies if a’s safety is demonstrated penwest would next conduct a phase a trial evaluating the effect of shortterm treatment of a on biomarkers of oxidative stress in patients with mitochondrial respiratory chain disease in the second half of  we understand that success in these studies then would be followed by phase b or phase  studies which could commence in the second half of  and potentially be completed in the  time frame according to the corporate presentation the phase a biomarker study if successful would demonstrate proofofconcept and serve as a “value creation point” for penwest as participants in the biopharmaceutical industry you do not need to be reminded by us how risky and capital intensive drug development is or how only an estimated  of compounds in phase  clinical trials make it to market nor should you need to be told that the capital markets have all but shut down for earlystage biopharmaceutical companies and that preserving cash is of utmost importance in these unprecedented economic times we thought it might be helpful however to discuss the programspecific reasons why we believe that the development of a faces even greaterthanusual challenges vitamin e rights to a were acquired through a july   licensing agreement with privatelyowned edison pharmaceuticals inc “edison” under this agreement penwest has paid edison  million including a  million upfront payment a  million loan to edison that penwest immediately wrote off through an impairment charge for its full value and  million in research funding over the past  months while management has told us that it is not prepared to disclose the chemical identity of a publicly available information would seem to indicate that it is alphatocopheryl quinone which is a chemical name for vitamin e because alphatocopheryl quinone qualifies as a dietary supplement under fda regulations it at any time could be made commercially available by dietary supplement manufacturers through nutritional health stores and websites furthermore the intellectual property position for a is tenuous at best a there is no compositionofmatter patent covering alphatocopheryl quinone b penwestedison has no issued us patent with any claims covering even the use of alphatocopheryl quinone and c a competitor santhera pharmaceuticals “santhera” has a us patent that issued more than  years ago that claims the use of a class of molecules encompassing alphatocopheryl quinone for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases to be commercially viable as a potential treatment for an orphan disease affecting only a few thousand individuals a would need to achieve and sustain reimbursement and market acceptance at a very high price point we do not see how this would be possible in light of the facts discussed above if santhera succeeds penwest will be many years behind the competition as you know santhera is developing idebenone a compound that penwest indicates is chemically similar to a for mitochondrial diseases santhera announced that it achieved full recruitment of its us and european pivotal phase  trials in october  and december  respectively and that if the outcome of its us trial is positive in the middle of this year it would be in a position to make regulatory filings in  as one benchmark of time idebenone completed phase  trials fully  years ago and phase  results are still forthcoming while one can always hope to be faster than others penwest will have to contend with the countervailing headwind that if idebenone is successful developing a would likely be more not less challenging because a it would be more difficult to enroll patients into a trial of an investigational agent if a proven agent is available and b it is likely that the fda would require a pivotal trial that compares a to that proven agent which would require far more patients than a placebocontrolled trial from a commercial standpoint while it is often argued that being second or third to market can be sufficiently lucrative we believe that this is not the case for an orphan condition affecting only a few thousand patients if santhera fails there will be no basis to continue since a is chemically similar to idebenone and both a and idebenone are chemical analogues of the same prototype molecule coenzyme q there would be little rationale to continue a’s development if idebenone does not demonstrate efficacy in its phase  trials a time line for proof of concept that will not be met as mentioned above penwest hopes to generate proofofconcept through its planned phase a biomarker study in the second half of  and that this in turn will serve as a “value creation point” for the company unfortunately existing data indicate that this will not be the case there are no validated surrogate end points for mitochondrial diseases a validated surrogate end point is a laboratory measurement or “biomarker” that through a clinical trial of a pharmacologic agent has been shown to predict a change in clinical outcome the premise is that if this link is established then future clinical trials need only show an effect on the surrogate end point rather than the clinical outcome itself to establish proof of concept in point of fact not only are there no validated surrogate end points for mitochondrial diseases but the class of biomarkers that penwest is putting forward as candidate surrogate end points for this class of diseases namely markers of oxidative stress have actually been invalidated by santhera’s clinical experience with idebenone specifically in an october  review of santhera’s phase  clinical trial of idebenone in freidrich’s ataxia “fa” a mitochondrial disease in the peerreviewed journal lancet neurology it was reported that idebenone failed to show an effect on any markers of oxidative stress despite some trends suggesting potential activity on clinical outcomes the authors note “the exact mechanism of idebenone’s effect in fa is unclear in the absence of a detectable effect based on the hypothesized mechanism ie reduced oxidative stress a nonspecific effect of idebenone cannot be excluded”  hence with biomarkers of oxidative stress rendered clinically meaningless penwest will have to await clinical outcome data from phase b or  trials for proof of concept and hence “value creation” such data unfortunately are many years and many tens of millions of dollars away where is all of our money going we are concerned about the continued level of spend at penwest and the complete lack of value that this spend is creating   million in zero out based on the corporate presentation penwest’s cash spend in  was  million million consisting of  million million for “programs” and  million million for “overhead” these “programs” consisted of nalbuphine er which failed in a phase a trial pw which failed in a phase  trial and a discussed above as for the “overhead” we are shocked by this dollar range mr tang has served on the boards of several public companies and tang capital and perceptive are investors in many more what are often termed “public company costs” which include director and officer insurance audit costs and certain legal costs typically approximate  million annually so where did the remaining  million million go it did not go toward supporting the receipt of the opana er royalty since as discussed earlier this is a passive income stream  a similar theme in the corporate presentation penwest has provided an outlook for  that cash spend will be in the range of  million million this consists of  million for “programs” which are down to one given last year’s failure of nalbuphine er and pw and “overhead” of a remarkably similar and similarly shocking  million million if this is truly overhead and by its definition cannot be tied to any activity that is creating value for shareholders we urge you to eliminate it immediately if however these dollars have been mischaracterized as overhead and are in fact necessary to progress a then they would serve as further support that a is a negativereturn proposition and should be eliminated anyways lottery ticket strategy based on the lack of rational explanation for the company’s enthusiasm behind a and the remarkable magnitude of spending at the company others have begun to speculate on what the strategy of the company actually is and whether there are other motives which are perhaps diametrically opposed to that of creating shareholder value afoot as one of the four equity research analysts who provide coverage on the company recently wrote “lottery ticket strategy management continues to manage for the pipedream our opinion that is referred to as a for mitochondrial diseases to run a whole company for a single product that is not even beyond proof of concept is a profound disservice to shareholders…the overhead is just too heavy to maintain this expensive endeavor note that the ppco management team has very little impact on the true share price driver the opana er pain drug royalty stream  our opinion beyond signing royalty checks and management should not be given credit for its marketing success again our opinion the board represents who shareholders or management you decide in november  the board implemented a retention package that rewards management for a change of control  of salary and highest bonus since at the company jennifer good took control as ceo in june  and the stock has fallen from the share range to currently under share why compensate this performance for a takeout that could be in the share range shareholders deserve a board response to this question ironically the company is getting rid of cfo ben palleiko who is the one person we would have chosen to keep”  management and board have not invested in penwest stock tang capital and perceptive have invested more than  million of their money in the stock of penwest based on our review of sec filings the current officers and directors have invested substantially zero dollars in the company’s stock since july   the date on which the sec began requiring electronic reporting of insider transactions in point of fact over this time period this group has actually realized  million in profits through the sale of penwest stock obtained through the exercise of incentive and nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock grants this is in addition to the more than  million in cash compensation through salaries bonuses and board fees that this group has received during this time while there is no legal requirement that management or board members personally invest in any company that they run we are concerned that the lack of investment here may be unduly influencing the decisions being made or not being made by penwest’s officers and directors because there is not a strong alignment of interests between these individuals and penwest’s shareholders a winwin proposition if management and members of the board are truly committed to a we would welcome the company entering into a transaction with these insiders whereby penwest grants them or an entity they create rights to a and any followon compounds free of charge in return for the spending reductions we are seeking as owners of  of the company’s stock we pledge to support such a transaction our final plea that you act now we again implore the board to act swiftly and decisively to preserve shareholder value if you are unwilling to do so by march   we plan to take the following actions to protect our interests and the interests of all shareholders inspection of books and records pursuant to washington law we plan to deliver to the company’s corporate secretary a demand to inspect the company’s books and records so that we may better understand your actions or lack thereof as board members in particular we will request and expect to be provided with access to all corporate documentation including all materials reviewed by each of you as directors of the company related to among other things  the licensing of the a program from edison your decision to continue developing a despite its weak scientific foundation your decision to continue employing a workforce much larger than needed to develop a single compound in phase  trials your failure to take appropriate steps as fiduciaries to protect the company’s remaining value and return that value to shareholders and the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the recent departure of your chief financial officer judicial confirmation of our board nominations on january   we wrote a letter to penwest’s corporate secretary notifying you that we intend to nominate  persons for election to the board of directors in this letter we requested that you confirm that our notice complies with penwest’s notice provisions in its bylaws to date although  weeks have passed since the date of that request you have refused to provide the requested confirmation we are again requesting that you confirm no later than march   that our january   notice complies with penwest’s bylaws and that we therefore will be permitted to make our nominations and submit votes in favor of our nominees at the  annual meeting of shareholders alternatively if it is your opinion that our notice does not comply with penwest’s notice provisions please identify all deficiencies in our notice if you do not respond we will promptly seek judicial enforcement of our rights in the washington state courts referendum vote to publicly demonstrate in a highly quantitative and rigorous manner how overwhelmingly penwest’s shareholders are in favor of the actions we are advocating we intend to notify the company in compliance with its bylaw provisions of our intention to bring to a vote of the shareholders at the  annual meeting a referendum on the future direction of the company specifically we will ask shareholders whether they believe that penwest should take prompt and thoughtful action to preserve shareholder value by immediately winding down substantially all of the company’s operations so that the full value of the opana er royalty income stream will be retained by the company bylaw amendments we plan to propose bylaw amendments that will require the board to be more responsive and accountable to the wishes of its shareholders legal action against the company’s officers and directors in light of the facts set forth above as well as information to be obtained by way of our books and records request we intend to vigorously pursue all of our shareholder rights by way of litigation against the officers and directors of the company including but not limited to claims of breach of fiduciary duty each of you is individually accountable we have made many attempts to present our case to you through letters from perceptive to you on november   and december   a meeting with jennifer good the company’s president and chief executive officer and perceptive on december   a meeting with ms good and tang capital on january   a meeting with paul freiman the company’s chairman and tang capital on february   and a meeting with mr freiman and perceptive on february   following these communications and interactions we have received nothing more than a an indication by mr freiman to kevin tang of tang capital that he would be invited to present at the february board meeting followed by no invitation actually being extended b a suggestion by mr freiman to joseph edelman of perceptive that he may join the board on the condition that the tang capital nominees withdraw and c an attempt by mr freiman to persuade mr edelman to consider selling perceptive’s penwest stock at current market prices we understand that you have decided to delegate the role of communicating with us to ms good and mr freiman needless to say we are disappointed in your continued lack of response to our repeated requests for action we do not need to remind you that as members of the board each of you is individually responsible for exercising your judgment as fiduciaries to the company’s shareholders this is not a responsibility that can be delegated to management nor abdicated by relying on the efforts of certain directors any failure to properly discharge your fiduciary duties is a failure for which each of you can be held personally responsible mr paul freiman as recently retired president and chief executive officer of neurobiological technologies inc you told mr tang that you pushed for the immediate cessation of operations for the benefit of shareholders following the failure of that company’s investigational drug candidate should you not do the same here ms jennifer good in your first role as president and chief executive officer of a public company do you really want to pursue an agenda that is not supported by your shareholders dr christophe bianchi with your experience as head of commercial operations at millennium pharmaceuticals inc we ask that you speak up about the high probability that even if a were to survive the long development path that lies ahead of it its commercial viability would be questionable dr peter drake as a veteran investment analyst who covered biotechnology stocks for more than a decade and now manager of mayflower partners a health care investment fund can you not identify with the analysis we lay out in this letter and empathize with the position that this management team has put us in dr david meeker with your experience running the world’s largest business focused on orphan diseases as president of the lsd therapeutics business unit of genzyme corporation you are in a unique position to explain to your colleagues how in a world of scarce resources a is not competitive with other programs being developed for orphan diseases ms anne vanlent as former chief financial officer of barrier therapeutics inc you should have a keen appreciation for how a high cash burn rate can destroy shareholder value even in a company that has successfully brought products to market mr robert hennessey as former president and chief executive officer of genome therapeutics corporation and a board member of its successor oscient pharmaceuticals corporation you too must be acutely aware of the perils of a high cash burn rate especially in today’s economic environment mr james o’shea as former president and chief operating officer of sepracor where you focused for many years on maximizing that company’s profit margin are you not concerned about the amount of cash being spent on overhead that is producing no value dr john staniforth as a coinventor of the timerx technology that enabled opana er to become the commercial success that it is are you not disappointed that all of the value that has been created by this product is being wasted on highrisk rd gambles with weak scientific foundations in closing we implore you to consider the facts discussed above and to rise to the task of taking the decisive actions outlined in this letter required to preserve shareholder value we look forward to

accounting from the university of southern california our pledge to make the board accountable to the shareholders a final word on corporate governance it is our belief that it is a board’s duty to govern a company for the benefit of the company’s shareholders not itself or the management team the shareholders are after all the owners of a company and the salaries and fees paid to board members and managers are paid by them as we have discussed in the past we believe that penwest’s corporate governance is a disgrace and that the company’s policies and tactics – ranging from its staggered board to its establishment of a “poison pill” – have been borne out of an explicit desire by the company’s legacy leadership to suppress shareholder input and avoid accountability this has to change if our nominees are elected we pledge to recommend that the board eliminates the staggered board eliminates the poison pill and takes other actions necessary to make the board wholly accountable to

to fellow shareholders march    am eastern daylight time san diego  new yorkbusiness wiretang capital partners lp “tang capital” and perceptive life sciences master fund ltd “perceptive” today announced that they have issued a letter to fellow shareholders of penwest pharmaceuticals co nasdaq ppco the text of the letter follows tang capital partners lp eastgate mallsan diego ca  perceptive life sciences master fund ltd park avenue th floornew york ny  march   dear fellow penwest shareholder tang capital partners lp and its affiliates “tang capital” and perceptive life sciences master fund ltd and its affiliates “perceptive” are the two largest shareholders of penwest pharmaceuticals co “penwest” or the “company” and together own  of the company’s outstanding common stock we have some serious concerns about the conduct of penwest’s board of directors and will soon be sending you proxy materials and asking for your support on a number of matters at the  annual meeting specifically we will be seeking your vote on a the election of our three nominees to the board of directors b a referendum on the future direction of the company and c bylaw amendments that will require the board to be more responsive and accountable to the wishes of penwest’s shareholders having become frustrated by the board’s actions and obstructionist tactics over the past several months we are undertaking this proxy contest only as a last resort our experience evaluating and governing life sciences companies tang capital and perceptive are both investment funds that focus exclusively on the health care industry the vast majority of both funds’ investment activities involve smallcapitalization pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies like penwest tang capital has operated since  and perceptive has operated since  kevin tang the managing director of tang capital’s general partner has served as a director of several life sciences companies and currently is a director of ap pharma inc and ardea biosciences inc from  to  mr tang held various positions at deutsche banc alex brown inc most recently serving as managing director and head of the firm’s life sciences research group prior to founding perceptive joseph edelman the managing member of its investment manager was a senior analyst at paramount capital from  to  and the senior biotechnology analyst at prudential securities from  to  our interest is aligned with yours first and foremost we assure you that our interest is aligned with yours to state it plainly we have one interest in mind and that is to maximize the price of penwest’s stock so that we can maximize the return on our investment like you we have invested precious capital to obtain our equity position penwest’s contention in its march   letter to shareholders that tang capital’s interests are not aligned with yours because its cost basis is low is absurd tang capital and perceptive alike are interested in achieving the maximum value for their shares going forward together tang capital and perceptive have invested more than  million in the common stock of penwest over a period of approximately two years by contrast as outlined in our march   letter to penwest’s board of directors the officers and directors of penwest have invested virtually nothing in penwest’s stock since july   to make matters worse this group has actually realized  million in profits from the sale of penwest stock obtained through the exercise of incentive and nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock grants during this period all the while this group continues to benefit from considerable cash compensation from the company which has amounted to more than  million during this period thus it appears that it is the interests of the board and management that are not aligned with yours your board’s response to our last plea for action in our march   letter to penwest’s board we asked that it stop wasting corporate assets and substantially wind down the company’s operations so that the company’s shareholders may realize the full value of the opana er royalty income stream we also asked that it confirm that our january   notice that we intend to nominate three persons for election to the board of directors at the  annual meeting complies with penwest’s advanced notice bylaw provisions penwest’s board has chosen to do neither instead as outlined in a march   press release and form k penwest has reinstated a shareholder rights plan or “poison pill” to prevent tang capital and perceptive from acquiring more penwest stock and to prevent any other shareholder from acquiring more than  of penwest’s outstanding stock once again instead of taking actions to preserve shareholder value penwest’s board is taking action to further entrench itself against the wishes of its shareholders importantly we are not alone in our view that poison pills are not in the best interests of shareholders major proxy advisory services including glass lewis  co and riskmetrics group are squarely against them in its proxy paper policy guidelines for us companies glass lewis states that “poison pill plans generally are not in the best interests of shareholders” in its  proxy report on penwest specifically riskmetrics group deemed the presence of the company’s poison pill as a negative governance factor in its march   letter to shareholders penwest indicates that perceptive’s increase in ownership position in spring  triggered changeofcontrol limitations under section  of the internal revenue code that caused penwest to lose significant net operating loss carryforwards and rd tax credits you should know that penwest on march   and again on march   twice amended its thenexisting poison pill specifically to allow perceptive to increase its ownership position ultimately to  of the company’s outstanding common stock it is these amendments which were recommended by management and approved by the board that allowed perceptive to increase its position to a level that exceeded the threshold required to trigger the changeofcontrol limitation management states that “institutional investors like perceptive must be aware of these tax rules” and in hindsight faults perceptive for “destroying value” by limiting penwest’s tax assets in fact it is the company’s management and board that through the recommendation and approval of the poison pill amendments allowed this limitation to be triggered therefore they should be held solely responsible for the “value destruction” insist that your board lets the shareholders decide we believe that the majority of shareholders share our view that our recommended actions are in their best interests penwest’s board apparently disagrees in its march   letter to shareholders penwest’s board states that “many shareholders have told us that they firmly believe these two shareholders do not represent their interests and the company should continue executing on its strategy for ” as we outlined in our march   letter we plan to find out the truth specifically we intend to bring to a vote of the shareholders at the  annual meeting a referendum on the future direction of the company in this referendum we will ask shareholders whether they believe that penwest should take prompt and thoughtful action to preserve shareholder value by immediately winding down substantially all of the company’s operations so that the full value of the opana er royalty income stream will be retained for the benefit of shareholders we believe that this referendum vote will demonstrate in a highly quantitative and rigorous manner that the majority of penwest’s shareholders are in favor of the actions we are advocating we herein ask our fellow penwest shareholders to a urge penwest’s board to convene its  annual meeting as soon as possible so that the referendum vote can be taken and b insist that penwest’s board honor the results of this referendum vote by immediately taking the actions requested should a majority of shareholders vote for them with respect to this last point you should know that adoption of our proposals is not assured even in the case of an overwhelming vote in their favor and therefore your insistence that the board honor the wishes of shareholders is critical this is because your company has a classified or “staggered” board which means that only a minority of directors in this case three of nine stand for election each year as a result even with a vote of an overwhelming majority of shareholders it is not possible to replace a majority of the board and therefore ensure a change in the company’s direction until the second of two annual shareholder meetings as this represents yet another mechanism for management entrenchment and evasion of accountability proxy advisory firms universally frown on these provisions in its proxy paper policy guidelines for us companies glass lewis  co states that “glass lewis favors the repeal of staggered boards and the annual election of directors we believe staggered boards are less accountable to shareholders than boards that are elected annually furthermore we feel the annual election of directors encourages board members to focus on shareholder interests” in a similar vein riskmetric group’s us proxy voting manual states “a classified board tips the balance of power too much toward incumbent management at the price of potentially ignoring shareholder interests” background on our position below we summarize why we believe that the actions we are advocating are in the best interests of shareholders we also refer you to our press release dated march   and the letter to the penwest board enclosed therein for a more complete discussion of our position tang capital and perceptive continue to believe that there is significant value in the royalty income stream on opana er that penwest receives from licensee endo pharmaceuticals “endo” opana er had net sales in  of approximately  million million up approximately  yearoveryear net of a royalty holiday and development cost recoupments penwest by our estimates will earn royalties at an effective rate of approximately  in  and  in  resulting in royalty income of approximately  million million this year and  million million next year depending on sales growth to be clear this income stream is substantially passive and requires negligible resources from penwest according to penwest’s licensing agreement with endo dated april   and amended january   and july   penwest must supply endo sufficient quantities of formulated timerx the extended release technology for opana er the fullyburdened cost of which is reimbursed by endo furthermore at the option of penwest a contract manufacturer may be used to produce the required supply of timerx also at endo’s cost we believe that this passive income stream the capital from which could eventually be distributed to shareholders is instead being wasted on “overhead” and a a single drug candidate in earlystage development that in our view is not worth developing according to financial guidance provided in its march   press release penwest is planning for  revenues almost all of which are derived from the opana er royalty of  million million  operating expenses of  million million and a  net loss of  million million based on this guidance and figures provided in penwest’s december  corporate presentation we estimate that penwest is planning for  cash spend of  million million on “overhead” and  million on “programs” associated with a questions you may wish to ask management in evaluating the credibility of management and the reasonableness of its business plan we urge you to seek answers to the following questions most of these questions were raised in our march   letter and yet management has chosen not to respond to any of them why is it a good use of shareholder capital for a company with a single compound in active development that is only in phase  to spend  million million on “overhead” there simply is no rational explanation if the officers and directors are so convinced that the shareholder capital they continue to spend will generate a positive return why has none of them invested hisher own capital in penwest’s stock over the past five years actions speak louder than words why does management continue to say that the identity of a has not been disclosed when it is on a public website penwest management as recently as march   on penwest’s quarterly conference call continues to state that the chemical identity of a “has not been made public…but it is not a vitamin e derivative” as indicated in our march   letter according to the fda’s “list of orphan designations and approvals” httpwwwfdagovorphandesignatlistxls row  a is alphatocopheryl quinone is management unaware that the identity of the only drug candidate penwest has in active development is indeed disclosed or worse has management been purposely attempting to hide a’s identity how would a vitamin derivative or vitamin metabolite with no patent protection be a commercially viable drug contrary to management’s statements alphatocopheryl quinone is a vitamin e derivative specifically according to peerreviewed scientific literature alphatocopheryl quinone is oxidized vitamin e or a metabolite of vitamin e    its structure has been known for seven decades as has its role as an oxidized derivative of vitamin e  neither penwest nor its licensor edison pharmaceuticals inc “edison” has any issued patent covering either the composition or the use of alpha tocopheryl quinone for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases furthermore a competitor santhera pharmaceuticals “santhera” has a us patent issued more than  years ago that claims the use of derivatives of coenzyme q for the treatment of mitochondrial diseases and could be asserted as encompassing alphatocopheryl quinone  as an indicator of how penwest spends its shareholders’ capital did penwest get its money’s worth in its deal with edison under its agreement with edison penwest has paid edison  million including a  million upfront payment a  million loan to edison that penwest immediately wrote off through an impairment charge for its full value and  million in research funding over the month period ending december   since there is no intellectual property covering alphatocopheryl quinone what did penwest get in return for the upfront fee and loan the  million in research funding was intended for the discovery of followon compounds that would be patentable new chemical entities have such followon compounds materialized how would a be competitive in the marketplace or even be able to make it to market in a timely fashion should santhera’s idebenone be successful santhera’s idebenone currently in phase  clinical trials is many years ahead of a in development if idebenone is proven effective and approved would it not significantly complicate the development of a and limit its market potential as outlined in our march   letter why would a still be worth pursuing if idebenone fails to show efficacy a is chemically similar to idebenone and both a and idebenone are chemical analogues of the same prototype molecule coenzyme q hence what would be the rationale to continue a’s development if idebenone does not demonstrate efficacy in its phase  trials how will proof of concept and “value creation” be achieved in phase a when biomarkers of oxidative stress have been invalidated as surrogate end points as stated in its march   letter to shareholders management continues to contend that it will “gain a better understanding of proof of concept” through its phase b and a clinical trials planned for this year as we outlined in our march   letter the class of biomarkers that penwest plans to measure in its phase a trial namely markers of oxidative stress have actually been invalidated as surrogate end points for mitochondrial diseases by santhera’s clinical experience with idebenone hence how will proof of concept and “value creation” be achieved short of data on clinical outcomes which are many years and tens of millions of dollars away if the officers and directors are so convinced of the merits of the a development program why do they not accept our winwin proposition and take it free of cost we continue to be disappointed in the directors’ and officers’ determination to spend shareholders’ capital without any commitment to spend their own in our march   letter we proposed that the company enter into a transaction with these insiders whereby penwest grants them or an entity they create rights to a and any followon compounds free of charge in return for the spending reductions we are seeking why are they not interested in this proposal in closing we look forward to working with you our fellow shareholders to obtain answers to these and other important questions and more importantly to steer penwest in a direction that will finally maximize shareholder value as soon as possible after penwest’s board establishes the dates for the  annual meeting we will be sending you
