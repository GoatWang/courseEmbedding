weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

solutions  lester petch ceo latest research report why were banking on banks  july        the financials sector has had a shaky start to the year following strong performance towards the end of last year on prospects of growth and inflation from a stimulative economic agenda from the trump administration despite this the sector is up approximately  for the year to date and in our opinion poised for further strong performance into the second half of the year to serve and protect protecting clients wealth through turbulent times  july        to serve and protect is a phrase of singular simplicity coined by the lapd in the ’s to embody its mission statement since then it has cemented itself as the cornerstone of us and arguably global law enforcement so what’s a us law enforcement adage doing in an investment update to our clients message from the ceo  june        the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes  and ships  and sealing wax  of cabbages  and kings  and why the sea is boiling hot  and whether pigs have wings      the walrus and the carpenter lewis carroll another binary event  uk general election  june        in a strange twist of fate with just two weeks to go until the anniversary of the brexit referendum the uk electorate is back in the polling booth voting on the direction of uk politics now for many this will be a proxy vote on allowing mrs may to continue what she started with the issuing of article  could trump bring the bull market to a halt  may        the recent high profile news in the us is about trump no surprise there then and his seemingly irrational behaviour with regards to the abrupt firing of his fbi director and the russian influence that portended it this has taken centre stage and caused the first real overnight market setback for months domestic disappointment international success  may        for all of president trump’s posturing on twitter we don’t envy his position if people came to you with the notion they would be closely judging your achievements in your job over the first  days would you be concerned at the very least keen to make an impression perhaps now imagine that group is over  million strong and your office is the highest in the land having  symbolic days to come through for  million expectant voters whilst trying to prove another  million distrusting voters that you are the man for the job would almost certainly give most of us sleepless nights mays uturn why now  april        from the toppling of a prime minister and flash crashes in the pound all the way down to the callous downsizing of our nation’s toblerone bars the uk’s historic leave vote from the eu continues to run more like a suspensefilled thriller than a political motion to leave the single

leadership of her party during such a moment of enormous national significance millennials welleducated techsavvy and ready to change the world  april        some say they’re just out of nappies others say they’re the next world leaders we say that the millennial generation those born between  and  are transforming the image of socially responsible investing sri knowledgeable and wellconnected the millennials are using their power to drive the investment universe to cater to their demands for investments which not only provide competitive financial returns but also deliver measurable environmental and social benefits a journey through europe’s political minefield…  march        i don’t think we’re alone in saying  will go down in history as a watershed moment for global politics  a year when the people stood up and voted for wholesale change arguably the only thing upstaging ’s propensity for shocks is ’s potential to deliver more of the same and possibly on an even bigger scale hammond keeps powder dry ahead of brexit  march        philip hammond delivered his first and ironically his last spring budget yesterday in what was considered by many as a budget designed to set the stage for brexit with brexit being the obvious elephant in the commons yesterday commentators quipped that the chancellor managed to get through the entire speech without even mentioning the word diamonds in the rough  march        emerging markets ems is the wellworn phrase coined to describe the group of countries considered to be underdeveloped but which are rapidly growing and urbanising despite their reputation for carrying significant economic and political risk ems present opportunities to invest in companies looking to take advantage of the growing population of consumers the result potentially higher investment returns compared to investments in developed countries trump takes his throne  january        the dust had settled the shock had begun to subside and the hecklers had… well they’re still heckling… but nonetheless donald trump was sworn in as the th president of the united states taking his throne as leader of the world’s most powerful nation  review   outlook  january         in politics  four down one to go harold wilson is attributed as saying that a week is a long time in politics one wonders what he would have made of the political drama throughout  an extraordinary year of political upheaval where the improbable became routine  days to deliver  january         was tumultuous in the context of political upheaval but  promises to be no less interesting decisions made by the electorate in the uk over brexit and the us over trump will see their expectations or fears unfold in  for once the politicians have to deliver on the electorates wishes message from the ceo  december        i cant change the direction of the wind but i can adjust my sails to always reach my destination jimmy dean      trick question

                     winston churchill   the markets aren’t having it  november        capital is a coward at the first sign of trouble everyone calls it “uncertainty” these days it bolts for the door it’s what the majority of the media and politicians warned us would happen if trump won it sounded plausible and all appeared to be going to their script in the small hours of last wednesday morning when it became apparent that trump’s victory was nailed on but the markets weren’t having it  trumped by the state of florida  november        the us electorate have spoken and the world is a more volatile place this morning  is it the dawn of mad maxor simply the dawn of a new era in politics  for the second time in  and after the shock of the brexit vote an electorate has overturned the establishment and made it clear well by a simple majority that the road ahead needs to be considered differently  it lay ultimately with the state of florida to give the free world its new leader – who would have thought that welcome to florida  november        “good morning i’m al gore and i’m the former next president of the united states”     al gore tokyo

hillary clinton had secured herself a comfortable  lead in the polls and global markets broadly relaxed any thoughts about donald trump taking residence in the white house however as is often the way the story didn’t end there playing the endgame  october        the problem with political suicide is that you live to regret it    winston churchill    riding high under a clear blue sky  august        this time last year the uk’s stock market was at a similar level to today and pretty much where it had been sitting calmly for over a year international bond and currency markets were relatively sanguine all playing along nicely to the script written by the us federal reserve improving economic data supportive central banks and some temporary relief from eurozone woes courtesy of the sacrosanct european commission holidays added to the general feeling of a classic stock market summer daze no time for gambling on red or black  july         “there is a very easy way to return

escape  july        we received news yesterday of the suspension of trading in the mg property and the standard life ignis uk property funds the managers of both of these funds have taken the decision to close or “gate” the funds in order to stop redemptions depleting the cash in the funds to a point where they would become forced sellers of property assets the real bricks and mortar properties in which they are invested around the uk  osborne sets the record straight…  june        “i should think it hardly possible to state the opposite of the truth with more precision” – winston churchill they say economists add a decimal point to show they have a sense of humour and so maybe they had a hand in george osborne’s forecast that within two years the uk would face a recession and minus

  playing it safe  june        it’s often the case that some of the most thought provoking comments come from unexpected sources it was actually the director of bonds at rathbones who also sits on the bank of england’s debt management office consultation committee who reminded me the other day of the simple fact that in every year since the global financial crisis gfc of  the ftse  index has fallen once at least   bremain  june        the last day of may has usually been a time to sharpen one’s pencil to write a review of whatever what was to blame for the often recurring stock market phenomenon of sellinmayandgoaway not this year there’s almost nothing at all in the newswires for markets to get excited about indeed even the keenest cricket fan might’ve been surprised to see the front cover

cliff in my new maserati”   gordon gekko wall street  review of the first quarter   april        the year started with a number of new statistical records not least of which was the us stock market suffering its worst start to the year since  of course as is almost always the case in today’s globalised world the concerns stretched further afield and in this case china was held up as the culprit with their central bank being accused of indulging in the new cold war of currency manipulation when all think alike no one thinks very much  march        when all think alike no one thinks very much

smarter than the market – jim rogers february  from zirp to nirp – from zero to negative interest rate policy     tams outlook for   january        it would be easy to convince anyone that  is going to be more difficult than last year  the list of dreads threatening to derail stock and bond markets is pretty much the same as before but we are at least closer to understanding the end game of the post  “great financial crisis” as the us federal reserve start what they believe to be a year of interest rate hikes  so far so bad  january        it’s a good week for top drawer statistics and there are so many it’s hard to know where to start sterling has hit a  ½ year low against the us dollar the eurostoxx  index has had its worst week in four years  the ftse has posted its worst first week
