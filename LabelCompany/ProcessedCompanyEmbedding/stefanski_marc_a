best savings and mortgage rates not bells and whistles how rare is stefanskis year tenure as chairman and ceo third federal savings is one of  banks in the united states that are significant in size with at least  billion in assets among them only three have ceos who have served longer than stefanski founded in a bar by stefanskis parents at the end of the great depression third federal built a reputation as an honest lender with the best rates in town it wasnt about making money it was about helping people under marc stefanski the bank has broadened its mission investing in community projects helping schools building affordable housing and even helping employees lose weight and stop smoking i admire marc greatly said keycorp chairman and ceo beth mooney not only is he a solid banker hes a good person i think northeast ohio is a far better place because of his leadership fellow banker jerry kelsheimer region chair of fifth third bank said third federal is a formidable and respected competitor that has also dedicated itself to access to healthcare education and neighborhood development it is apparent that marc cares much for and about others and i have great admiration for that      there have been ups and downs third federal basks in its year record of earning the highest financial strength rating the bank has never laid off an employee in the last few years it expanded its lending to plus states but third federal tangled with regulators a few years ago mostly over administrative issues mortgage lending fell sharply during the financial crisis and locally third federal used to be the thirdlargest bank in cleveland by deposits now its no  as as citizens charter one has grown and huntington bought firstmerit still the throwback bank says times are better than ever especially since it just posted its best quarter in a decade stefanki and i recently sat down for a wideranging chat about whether third federal will ever sell to another bank why the bank doesnt have atms or a mobile app and why stefanski doesnt mind making mistakes we start out catching up about each others kids and we talk about how birth order can affect peoples personalities that leads to the first question q where are you in the birth order in your family a the youngest yeah see firstborns are perfectionists babies like myself were not perfectionists we like to have the most fun    do you know  percent of all airline pilots are firstborns or only children pilots like to be in control and you want them in control because they are precise me as a baby id say oh whats that button for   q how did being the baby of the family affect how you managed the company a we have a lot of fun here thats part of the culture i know my birth order is part of the reason why we have values of love trust commitment to excellence treating one another with respect and having fun thats part of our value system of how we operate the company how we make decisions with our products and services how we train people here its just been something weve been doing ever since i took over in  marc stefanskigus chan the plain dealer  q did the bank not have as much fun before you were ceo a it was a different place and time my father was a product of the depression he was at a company that closed its doors in  and when you closed the doors back then they closed for good   with him it was always business first family second i kind of reversed that and i found that i can make my family a priority and still run a pretty good company q so about the company your profits were up  percent in the first quarter you pulled back on reserves set aside for bad loans your stock is doing pretty well what are you working on now a the biggest thing weve been struggling with is consumer confidence    people have been holding back on going out and looking for a home because they want to sell their house first they dont want to get stuck with two homes    for a lot of people their k never really recovered during the last decade i think youve found wall street has done very well and some of the smartest people have been making money again and thats great but the guy on the street the job security hasnt been there the general consumer confidence hasnt been there and that affects housing     but this year our loan applications are up about  percent from last year at this time for purchases were back to a kind of cyclical environment first time in  years and that is good that means consumer confidence is coming back q is being ceo  years one of those markers like oh turning 0 and you kind of reflect back on life how has banking changed in  years a the regulatory environment is a lot tougher than it was i think the competition is a lot stiffer    we used to know our competitors across the street and we knew what day the loan committee met and we knew who was on their loan committee and we knew where their fields of concentration were where they wanted to make more loans than they did last quarter and last year so we knew a lot about our competition now today its all big business were one of the few remaining true community banks in the country even though were big  billion we run our company as if its a small company customers are first strategy second    we treat every customer as if theyre a vip you know whats important here  we dont have quotas no one is on commission thats a big deal in todays banking environment wells fargo for example is typical of how things operate in our industry today we never felt we could do the best service for our customer if someone is on commission and they get something out of it q you say that if things are going well the bank doesnt have a big reason to want to change but clearly the bank has had to change over your three decades as ceo regulations and technology probably have been the biggest drivers so how has the competition from the big banks and technology changed the way you do business a were able to reach different markets we are in  states now and were able to reach different markets without brick and mortar which is very cost effective    were in a pricesensitive business where no matter what market were in usually the best price gets the most business     we can usually beat every company out there right now we have a lowest rate guarantee so if you find a  rate thats lower than ours well match it or beat it q speaking of competition you and i have talked in the past about how many banks would be likely to disappear in the future here are the banks weve seen sell out in the last few years  firstmerit sold to huntington parkview sold to first national bank of pennsylvania lorain national sold to northwest valley savings sold to westfield ohio commerce sold to peoples western reserve sold to westfield and those are just the bigger deals are you surprised at the consolidation a no not at all in fact a lot of that is driven by regulatory environment because its been so tough you have compliance officers who are in high demand at a small company the compliance officer could be getting paid more than the ceo and so when those kinds of economics are going on within your company you begin to wonder is it worth the effort and it has been very very tough its been a trickledown effect from the regulations this goes way back  its unintended consequences sheila bair the former fdic chairman said it in her book about how it affects community banks and smaller banks that have a great purpose in this country but theyre being choked by the regulatory process when you add that to the more competitive environment that the bigger banks have brought to the table by putting a branch on every corner that makes it harder for a smaller bank to survive q one of the promises of this administration is rolling back some of the banking regulations is that doable now if im a small bank and i already sold because of regulations then that sucks for me do you think some of the regulations that have become reality in the last seven years can be rolled back a i think what theyre hoping to do is you have banks that are  billion in assets or greater right now and are subject to everything and you have ones that are a little bit less and are subject to most everything i think what theyre going to try to do is move that threshold to something higher than  billion maybe  billion could be 0 billion because realistically banks of that size while very big are not a systemic risk if they fail the other thing weve talked to legislators about is tying regulation to not just the asset level but also the capital ratio if you have a higher capital ratio like third federal has youre going to be less risky to the deposit insurance fund q you guys are still going hard on promoting adjustablerate loans  and  are these still really popular a yes about half of our originations are adjustables its a good deal we give them the option if rates are changing they can pay a fee and extend the rate theyre getting for another five years or another three years we call that the option arm   q when we talked in the past you said one of the things you were most proud of was never having laid off an employee you have more than 0 workers is that record still intact a it is and our turnover rate is  percent q im sure there were probably times especially when everything was hitting the fan that you had to bite the bullet in order not to let anybody go a we just redirected a lot of people to different parts of the company collections was a big deal compliance ended up being and still is a big deal internal audit was a big deal the regulatory environment almost required us to shift people around in fact we added about 0 people to our compliance area just to meet the regulatory requirements q im sure that track record helps company productivity because people are so appreciative of not having to worry about getting laid off during a downturn a yes and when we evaluate our associates here its based on a value system you know how do they work with others were big on relationships and relationship management how well are they working with their fellow associates thats our no  criterion q do you ever see a day when third federal would sell to another bank a i would never say never however the objective here is to keep this model intact as a tribute to my parents and hopefully im able to pass it on to the next generation because im just a steward im here just for a very short period of time this is a good thing we have here its a good thing for the community its a good thing for the people we employ here its been great for the stefanski family we would do ourselves a disservice if we sold the company it would almost be a slap in the face to the people who helped build this company to put ourselves up for sale q and youd have no guarantee that the core values you have held so close would stay intact a stop teresa its a camelot this doesnt exist outside of these four walls its certainly camelot if you notice too most of us are sitting at tables in the lunchroom throughout the bank that are round its no coincidence  we have a rotunda we have a round cobblestone area thats to emphasize that everyone has an equal say at the table every associate has a brick its a big deal this is a community effort that helped build this company and its a community effort that keeps it together my job and the stefanskis job is to maintain that and keep it going for the sake of the community because if were gone youre going to pay higher mortgage rates and your rates on your savings are going to be worse q on the flip side would you see third federal making a significant acquisition a well you know what we never say never weve looked at companies in the past but its hard to find companies that run anywhere close to the way we run their businesses may be more diversified which means we would have to liquidate parts of the business or the way that people were treated culturally would be a huge mismatch so we like to grow and we like to actually acquire customers one at a time were pretty good at that q you said if third federal werent here the community would see higher mortgage rates how much of an impact do you think you have on the competition here locally banks such as first federal of lakewood dollar bank geauga savings other banks that have been known as having lower rates do you think if you werent here that mortgage rates around here would go up and savings yields would go down a yes yes i honestly do heres what we learned in the late s and s there would be no fixed rate market right now in cleveland if it wasnt for third federal because every other bank in town our competition didnt offer a fixed rate mortgage in the late 0s early s and we did throughout that whole mess that took place and then the savings and loan debacle we kept our fixed rates so id say that my dad was instrumental in maintaining fixed rates in this marketplace for sure q switching topics technology you have long been proud that you werent about bells and whistles you dont have atms you dont have online bill pay you dont have a mobile app are you going to have to change a  we have online banking    if people want to transfer between accounts they can do that were working on our mobile banking right now you really have to look to the nottoodistant future thats where everything is going you cannot find anyone who doesnt carry that cell phone along with them    q some of it is demographics a yeah our customers are getting older and theyre dying the baby boomers wont be here in a little while and were going to stuck with the millennials and they think differently with facebook and twitter and the whole social media thing    its continuing to explode and its never going to go away we have to be able to adjust the point is that we as individuals have to adjust and third federal as a company certainly needs to adjust any company thats going to survive has got to be able to make those adjustments that will allow them to be competitive in whatever rate environment there is whatever socioeconomic environment there is whatever is going on in the world marc stefanskigus chan the plain dealer  q what are you most proud of during your time as ceo a theres an old story about a father and son in the business when the father gives up the reins to the son and the son takes over if the son does well the father had a good business if the son doesnt do well the son screwed it up so im just happy to be able to be here for a period of time to be the steward of this organization and to be able to pass it on to the next generation  ive tried to enhance it along the way with a strong relationship environment based on our value system that creates a culture that i think cant be duplicated you can replicate it you cant beat that into someone you cant regulate it you cant regulate ethics but if you treat someone the way you want to be treated with love and genuine concern and respect and trust youre building a strong foundation of a company that is built to last   q flip side whats your biggest regret during your time as ceo a i dont really have a regret q oh please there must be something that you later viewed as a mistake that you would have done differently a you mean shoulda coulda woulda honestly im not saying this trying to be haughty or narcissistic im just saying that everything thats occurred ive used as a learning experience so nothing goes wasted if its a good experience we want to do that again and keep doing it if its a bad experience were going to learn from that and were going to move on  q so if something happens that didnt go so well you view it that if you learn something from it then its a net positive a theres a difference between a bad decision and a mistake a mistake is you dont know any better something happens and you go oh my gosh im never going to do that again a bad decision is different because you know better and youre choosing to not do what you know to be the right answer so people forgive mistakes bad decisions its harder to forgive   q lets talk community issues you have the slavic village housing development to buy abandoned and blighted properties in the area and the tutoring program for slavic village students and you built the football stadium for cleveland central catholic high school and other teams a few years back  any other community projects going on a we have our p project which is a commitment to education in this immediate neighborhood that takes a family from when theyre having a child all of the way up through the college years basically its an educational programwe support other local community organizations the boys  girls club of cleveland is down the street theyve been great partners we built that assisted living place across the street broadway place elderly apartments we financed the shopping center down here broadway shoppes and weve given a lot of love and support and money to st stanislaus and holy name and central catholic   q and then of course theres rhondas kiss the charity you started in the name of your late wife to help clevelanders with cancer a  its just another way to emphasize the importance of family and honoring rhonda who was the only girl i dated for  years we were married  years its a program we developed to raise money for people who are going through cancer and cancer treatments people in need we provide things like rent payments and wigs and different things that you and i may not even think about but a lot of people cant afford   q what do you still want to accomplish as ceo a being able to pass on the company to the next generation q so does that mean you want to make the company stronger or more profitable or what a were not necessarily a profitdriven company sure we need profits i always talk about a companys purpose as a human being we breathe air to live but our sole purpose isnt breathing air same thing with a company a company needs to make money but thats not the sole purpose of a company there are other things that go along with that  the community involvement doing things that are going to help enhance peoples lives our focus isnt on the numbers per se but its how were doing to love and support the community and make a little bit of money along the way too q what do you want your legacy to be a we have a different game plan a different environment here    if you can build a culture of love and trust and respect and have fun along the way and you make money and youre doing meaningful things in the community and you have a family business thats a good thing     is it my legacy here no was i a good dad was i a good husband how my family is doing is as important as anything and you know im blessed i recently remarried she has two children so now my family is bigger q im assuming you dont have any planned date of retirement a i dont even know what that word is q do you have more certainty about who the next generation will be a i have five children ages  to  and nieces and nephews im only  but life is short and very unpredictable you never know i would have never thought my wife would have passed away so we have to be realistic in how we all approach that obviously theres succession planning that goes on here we sort of take it one day at a time and thank the lord for each day its obviously a gift from god view comments qa after  years as ceo of third

financed the shopping center down here broadway shoppes and weve given a lot of love and support and money to st stanislaus and holy name and central catholic   q and then of course theres rhondas kiss the charity you started in the name of your late wife to help clevelanders with cancer a  its just another way to emphasize the importance of family and honoring rhonda who was the only girl i dated for  years we were married  years its a program we developed to raise money for people who are going through cancer and cancer treatments people in need we provide things like rent payments and wigs and different things that you and i may not even think about but a lot of people cant afford   q what do you still want to accomplish as ceo a being able to pass on the company to the next generation q so does that mean you want to make the company stronger or more profitable or what a were not necessarily a profitdriven company sure we need profits i always talk about a companys purpose as a human being we breathe air to live but our sole purpose isnt breathing air same thing with a company a company needs to make money but thats not the sole purpose of a company there are other things that go along with that  the community involvement doing things that are going to help enhance peoples lives our focus isnt on the numbers per se but its how were doing to love and support the community and make a little bit of money along the way too q what do you want your legacy to be a we have a different game plan a different environment here    if you can build a culture of love and trust and respect and have fun along the way and you make money and youre doing meaningful things in the community and you have a family business thats a good thing     is it my legacy here no was i a good dad was i a good husband how my family is doing is as important as anything and you know im blessed i recently remarried she has two children so now my family is bigger q im assuming you dont have any planned date of retirement a i dont even know what that word is q do you have more certainty about who the next generation will be a i have five children ages  to  and nieces and nephews im only  but life is short and very unpredictable you never know i would have never thought my wife would have passed away so we have to be realistic in how we all approach that obviously theres succession planning that goes on here we sort of take it one day at a time and thank the lord for each day its obviously a gift from god view comments marc stefanski  people search
