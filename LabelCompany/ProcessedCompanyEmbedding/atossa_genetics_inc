atossa atossa genetics is a clinicalstage drug company developing novel proprietary therapeutics and delivery methods for breast cancer and other breast conditions we believe our innovative therapies and delivery methods can transform breast cancer treatment– with the goals of preventing breast cancer from developing in the first place to increasing the odds of surviving for those who do develop this deadly disease approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime every two minutes an american woman is diagnosed with breast cancer  die each year tamoxifen has been widely used for over  years for breast cancer  additional research has shown that it is the metabolites of tamoxifen of which endoxifen is the most active that have potential therapeutic value we are the only company in the world attempting to conquer breast cancer the way we are “the best way to treat a disease is to prevent it in the first place”  we are developing a topical drug a lotion applied to each breast to treat a condition known as high breast density  thirdparty studies have shown that high breast density increases the risk of developing breast cancer in some women breast density is diagnosed by mammography and approximately  million women have high density in the us tamoxifen has been demonstrated to reduce density and the incidence of breast cancer  however tamoxifen can have serious side effects because as a drug taken orally it is delivered “systemically” meaning it travels throughout the body to other areas the drug is not needed the goal with our topical endoxifen program is to treat high breast density with a local topical drug   “my biggest worry is that my breast cancer will return”  we are also developing an oral formulation of endoxifen for breast cancer survivors who are otherwise recommended to take tamoxifen the most commonly recommended fdaapproved drug to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence  tamoxifen however does not work for up to  of these patients  our goal with this program is to reduce the number of patients who may get breast cancer again even after initial treatment by providing a drug for those who may not fully benefit from tamoxifen   “why am i receiving a needle injection – my cancer is in the breast not the buttock”  we are also developing a new way to deliver pharmaceuticals – through microcatheters small tubes that can be inserted with anesthetic through the nipple so that pharmaceuticals can be targeted to the tissue where breast cancer actually grows our proprietary oral and topical forms of endoxifen are the subject of a comprehensive phase  clinical study in healthy women in australia our patented microcatheter technology is in a phase  clinical study that is also currently enrolling patients  read more about our programs quick links about atossa management investor relations media careers legal search for atossa genetics inc • corporate office  spring street

enrollment in both the oral and topical arms of our proprietary endoxifen phase  dose escalation study commented dr steven quay ceo and president of atossa the speed at which this study fullyenrolled is a testament to the enthusiasm for potential new therapies in the breast cancer field as well as the hard work and dedication of our cro cpr pharma and the personnel at atossa  we hope to report initial topline data before the end of the quarter and then subject to favorable phase  results and other regulatory requirements proceed to one or more phase  studies using both our oral and topical formulations added dr quay the objectives of this doubleblinded placebocontrolled repeat dose study of  healthy female subjects is to assess the pharmacokinetics of proprietary formulations of both oral and topical endoxifen dosage forms over  days as well as to assess safety and tolerability the study is being conducted in two parts based on route of administration atossa has also now completed the transfer of its fulvestrant microcatheter phase  study from columbia university medical center breast cancer programs where the study was initiated to montefiore medical center new york ny  we are pleased to report that the study has been transferred to montefiore which is a nationallyranked hospital commented dr quay while we cannot project the timing of completing enrollment in the study at this time we look forward to providing updates as this clinical trial continues to advance stated dr quay the fulvestrant microcatheter phase  study includes  women with ductal carcinoma insitu dcis or invasive breast cancer slated for mastectomy or lumpectomy this study will assess the safety tolerability and distribution of fulvestrant when delivered directly into breast milk ducts of these patients via microcatheters compared to those who receive the same product intramuscularly the secondary objective of the study is to determine if there are changes in the expression of ki as well as estrogen and progesterone receptors between a prefulvestrant biopsy and postfulvestrant surgical specimen digital breast imaging before and after drug administration in both groups will also be performed to determine the effect of fulvestrant on any lesions as well as breast density of the participant six study participants will receive the standard intramuscular fulvestrant dose of  mg to establish the reference drug distribution and  participants will receive fulvestrant by intraductal instillation utilizing atossas proprietary microcatheter technology about atossa genetics atossa

washington  warning letter dear dr quay during an inspection of your firm located in seattle washington on july   through july   an investigator from the united states food and drug administration fda determined that your firm manufactures the mammary aspirate specimen cytology test masct system and masct system collection kit  under section h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § h these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the body this inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section h of the act  usc § h in that the methods used in or the facilities or controls used for their manufacture packing storage or installation are not in conformity with the cgmp requirements of the quality system regulation found under title  code of federal regulations cfr part  we received a response from you dated august   concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the form fda  list of inspectional observations fda  that was issued to you we address the response below in relation to each of the noted violations these violations include but are not limited to the following       failure to establish and maintain procedures to control the design of the device in order to ensure that specified design requirements are met as required by  cfr a for example b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that you have not established design control procedures for the masct system we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate  while a procedure titled sop design control for the masct system was submitted in the response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all devices to ensure they had design control procedures in place as required for all devices       failure to establish and maintain adequate procedures for the identification documentation validation or where appropriate verification review and approval of design changes before their implementation as required by  cfr i for example b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that you have not established procedures for design changes for the masct system you have performed multiple design changes specifically a    you made a design change to a filter of the masct system prior to distribution the only documentation covering the design change is email communication between your firm and the contract manufacturer andb    you are currently performing design changes to the masct system device and design verification testing has been performed for these design changes however ms deborah hp jae your firm’s marketing director indicated that no design inputs or outputs were established and no verification procedures were established for these design changes to the masct system we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop design control for the masct system was submitted in the response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition you did not provide evidence that you documented the design changes for the change to the filter of the masct system nor other changes made to the masct system as required as a correction to this observation lastly you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all devices to ensure it implemented design changes made to devices as required       failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action as required by  cfr a for example when asked by the investigator mr b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that you have not established procedures for corrective and preventive action we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop corrective and preventive action was submitted in the response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed previous corrective actions to ensure they were completed as required       failure to maintain adequate complaint files and to establish and maintain adequate procedures for receiving reviewing and evaluating complaints by a formally designated unit as required by  cfr a for example when asked by the investigator mr b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that you have not established complaint handling procedures and that you do not have a formally designated unit for handling complaints your firm received a complaint in december  and another in january  concerning thread breakage of the masct system funnel however the complaints were not maintained in a complaint file we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop customer complaints was submitted in your response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition you did not provide evidence that you created a complaint file to include all complaints as required as a correction to this observation nor did you indicate you retrospectively reviewed all complaints to ensure they were received reviewed and evaluated as required as a corrective action to this observation       failure to maintain an adequate record of investigation by a formally designated unit when an investigation is made under  cfr  as required by  cfr e for example your firm received a complaint in december  and another in january  concerning thread breakage of the masct system funnel however the record of investigation for these complaints did not include all required information such as the exact date a complaint was received the address and phone number of the complainant dates and results of the investigation and correspondence with the complainant  we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop customer complaints was submitted in your response no evidence of implementation of or training on this procedure was provided in addition you did not provide evidence that you documented the record of the investigation of the complaint concerning the breakage of the masct system funnel received in december  and january  as required as a correction to this observation also you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all other complaints to ensure that the investigations completed were documented as required as a corrective action to this observation       failure to establish and maintain adequate requirements including quality requirements that must be met by suppliers contractors and consultants as required by  cfr a for example your firm contracts b however there is no documentation recording the evaluation and approval of these contractors when asked by the investigator b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that you have not established requirements that must be met by b we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop supplier evaluation and monitoring was submitted in your response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition your firm did not provide evidence that it evaluated b as a supplier as a correction to this observation also you did not provide evidence that you retrospectively reviewed all suppliers to ensure they were evaluated as required       failure to establish procedures for quality audits and conduct such audits to assure that the quality system is in compliance with the established quality system requirements and to determine the effectiveness of the quality system as required by  cfr  for example when asked by the investigator b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that your firm does not have procedures for quality audits we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop internal quality audits was submitted in your response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition your firm did not provide evidence that it conducted a quality audit as required as a corrective action to this observation lastly your firm did not provide evidence that it retrospectively reviewed all quality system procedures to ensure they were documented as required       failure of management with executive responsibility to review the suitability and effectiveness of the quality system at defined intervals and with sufficient frequency according to established procedures to ensure that the quality system satisfies the requirements of  cfr  and the manufacturer’s established quality policy and objectives as required by  cfr c for example when asked by the investigator b your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that your firm does not have procedures for management review we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate while a procedure titled sop management review was submitted in your response no evidence of implementation or training on this procedure was provided in addition your firm did not provide evidence that it conducted a management review as a corrective action as required       failure to establish and maintain procedures to ensure that device history records for each batch lot or unit are maintained to demonstrate that the device is manufactured in accordance with the device master record and the requirements of  cfr  as required by  cfr  for example your firm lacks procedures for device history records for the masct system when the investigator requested the device history record for the masct system ms deborah h p jae your firm’s marketing director indicated that b stated it did not maintain records for parts manufactured we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate the response states that sop design control for the masct system discusses the content of the device history record however this procedure addresses the content of a device history file and not a device history record in addition your firm did not provide evidence that it completed a device history record for the masct system nor did your firm provide evidence that it would retrospectively review records for other devices to ensure device history records were documented as required        failure to establish a quality plan which defines the quality practices resources and activities relevant to devices that are designed and manufactured as required by  cfr d for example when asked by the investigatorb your firm’s regulatory consultant indicated that your firm has not established a quality plan we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate the response states that a quality policy has been established and that a quality manual will be established by september   however no documentation was provided to support this response and no mention of a quality plan was discussed in the response our inspection also revealed that after the masct system device received k clearance k a modification to the nipple aspirate fluid naf specimen collection process was made the premarket notification submission k included instructions for use ifu stating to “wash the collection membrane with fixative solution into the collection vial   ” our inspection revealed your current ifu states “   apply one spray of saccomanno’s fixative to the collection membrane   ”  this change fixes the naf specimen to the filter paper rather than washing it into a collection vial     the aforementioned change to the device could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness and requires the submission of a k to fda as required by  cfr ai we have no record of receiving a k for this change to your product because you do not have marketing clearance from the fda marketing the changed product is a violation of the law in legal terms the product is adulterated under section fb  usc § fb and misbranded under section o of the act  usc § o your product is misbranded under the act because you did not submit a section k premarket notification which is required by  usc § k that shows your device is substantially equivalent to other devices that are legally marketed  until you submit a section k premarket notification and fda reviews it and notifies you that you may market your device your product is also adulterated under the act because the law requires and you do not have an approved premarket approval application that shows your device is safe and effective for a device requiring premarket approval the notification required by section k is deemed satisfied when a pma is pending before the agency  cfr b  the kind of information that your firm needs to submit in order to obtain approval or clearance for the device is described on the internet at httpwwwfdagovcdrhdevadvicehtml  the fda will evaluate the information that your firm submits and decide whether the product may be legally marketed our inspection and subsequent review of your websites wwwatossageneticscom and wwwnrlbhcom determined that your devices are misbranded under section a of the act  usc a and within the meaning of  cfr  in that your websites contain statements that create an impression of official approval of a device due to clearance of a premarket notification submission   specifically “   using our patented fdaapproved mammary aspirate specimen cytology test masct system   ” “   fda has determined based on clinical trial data that the masct system can be used in the determination andor differentiation of normal versus premalignant versus malignant cells   ” any representation that creates an impression of official approval of a device due to compliance with the premarket notification regulations is misleading  your devices were not approved by the fda but were determined to be substantially equivalent within the meaning of section ia of the act  usc cia  in addition your forecyte test is misbranded under section a of the act  usc a in that its labeling is false or misleading specifically its labeling contains the following statement “   fda cleared clinically proven and peer reviewed the forecyte test provides women aged  to  objective and actionable information to improve their breast health   ” your forecyte test was not cleared by fda we acknowledge that you modified some of the language on your websites during the inspection however your websites still reference “   fdacleared   ” in many instances our inspection also revealed that your devices are misbranded under section t of the act  usc  t in that your firm failed or refused to furnish material or information respecting the devices that is required by or under section  of the act  usc i and  cfr part  – medical device reporting mdr regulation significant deviations include but are not limited to failure to develop maintain and implement written mdr procedures as required by  cfr   for example your firm does not have a mdr procedure we reviewed your firm’s response and conclude that it is not adequate your response did not address the lack of an mdr procedure your firm should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter  failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the fda without further notice  these actions include but are not limited to seizure injunction and civil money penalties  also federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of warning letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts additionally premarket approval applications for class iii devices to which the quality system regulation violations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected  requests for certificates to foreign governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected please notify this office in writing within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter of the specific steps your firm has taken to correct the noted violations as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations or similar violations from occurring again  include documentation of the corrections andor corrective actions including any systemic corrective actions that your firm has taken  if your firm’s planned corrections andor corrective actions will occur over time please include a timetable for implementation of those activities  if corrections andor corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen business days state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this warning letter your firm’s response should be sent to us food and drug
