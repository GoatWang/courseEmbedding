research using a variety of data sources test your strategy over historical data and then test it going forward with live data topperforming algorithms will be offered investment allocations and those algorithm authors will share in the profits important concepts the quantopian platform consists of several linked components the quantopian research platform is an ipython notebook environment that is used for research and data analysis during algorithm creation it is also used for analyzing the past performance of algorithms the ide interactive development environment is used for writing algorithms and kicking off backtests using historical data algorithms can also be executed using live data  either paper trading on quantopian or realmoney trading through a broker integration all of these tools use the data provided by quantopian us equity price and volumes minute frequency us futures price and volumes minute frequency us equity corporate fundamentals and dozens of other integrated data sources this section covers each of these components and concepts in greater detail data sources we have minutebar historical data for us equities and us futures since  up to the most recently completed trading day data uploaded nightly a minute bar is a summary of an assets trading activity for a oneminute period and gives you the opening price closing price high price low price and trading volume during that minute all of our datasets are pointintime which is important for backtest accuracy since our eventbased system sends trading events to you serially your algorithm receives accurate historical data without any bias towards the present during algorithm simulation quantopian uses astraded prices that means that when your algorithm asks for a price of a specific asset it gets the price of that asset at the time of the simulation for futures astraded prices are derived from electronic trade data when your algorithm calls for historical equity price or volume data it is adjusted for splits mergers and dividends as of the current simulation date in other words if your algorithm asks for a historical window of prices and there is a split in the middle of that window the first part of that window will be adjusted for the split this adustment is done so that your algorithm can do meaningful calculations using the values in the window quantopian also provides access to fundamental data free of charge the data from morningstar consists of over  metrics measuring the financial performance of companies and is derived from their public filings the most common use of this data is to filter down to a subset of securities for use in an algorithm it is common to use the fundamentals metrics within the trading logic of the algorithm in addition to pricing and fundamental data we offer a host of partner datasets combining signals found in a wide variety of datasets is a powerful way to create a highquality algorithm the datasets available include marketwide indicators like sentiment analysis as well as industryspecific indicators like clinical trial data each dataset has a limited set of data available for free full datasets available for purchase a la carte for a monthly fee the complete list of datasets is available here our us equities database includes all stocks and etfs that traded since  even ones that are no longer traded this is very important because it helps you avoid survivorship bias in your algorithm databases that omit securities that are no longer traded ignore bankruptcies and other important events and lead to false optimism about an algorithm for example leh lehman brothers is a security in which your algorithm can trade in  even though the company no longer exists today lehmans bankruptcy was a major event that affected many algorithms at the time our us futures database includes  futures the list includes commodity interest rate equity and currency futures  hour data is available for these futures  days a week sunday at pm  friday at pm et some of these futures have stopped trading since  but are available in research and algorithms to help you avoid survivorship bias there are many other financial data sources wed like to incorporate such as options and nonus markets what kind of data sources would you like us to have let us know research environment the research environment is a customized ipython server with this openended platform you are free to explore new investing ideas for most people the hardest part of writing a good algorithm is finding the idea or pricing edge the research environment is the place to do that kind of research and analysis in the research environment you have access to all of quantopians data  price volume corporate fundamentals and partner datasets including sentiment data earnings calendars and more the research environment is also useful for analyzing the performance of backtests and live trading algorithms you can load the result of a backtest or live algorithm into research analyze results and compare to other algorithms performances ide and backtesting the ide interactive development environment is where you write your algorithm its also where you kick off backtests pressing build will check your code for syntax errors and run a backtest right there in the ide pressing full backtest runs a backtest that is saved and accessible for future analysis the ide is covered in more detail later in this help document paper trading paper trading is also sometimes known as walkforward or outofsample testing in paper trading your algorithm gets live market data actually minute delayed data and trades against the live data with a simulated portfolio this is a good test for any algorithm if you inadvertently overfit during your algorithm development process paper trading will often reveal the problem you can simulate trades for free with no risks against the current market on quantopian quantopian paper trading uses the same orderfulfillment logic as a regular backtest including the slippage model before you can paper trade your algorithm you must run a full backtest go to your algorithm and click the full backtest button once that backtest is complete you will see a live trade algorithm button when you start paper trading you will be prompted to specify the amount of money used in the strategy note that this cash amount is not enforced  it is used solely to calculate your algorithms returns paper trading is currently only available for us equity trading live trading when you click the start trading button you will have the option to choose broker you will need to authenticate to your interactive brokers or robinhood account note quantopian does not store your brokerage password for more information about live trading and how to create an ib or robinhood account see our live trading faq for ib accounts we strongly recommend that you run your algorithm against ibs paper trading mode before running it against a real money account for robinhood accounts we recommend that you run your algorithm against quantopians paper trading mode before running it against a real money account paper trading is a good test to help find lingering bugs once youre satisfied with the paper trading performance you can stop the paper trading algorithm and relaunch it against your real money account while your algorithm is live trading you can continue to make changes in the ide to experiment with the code and run additional backtests this will not interfere with the live algorithm these changes will not apply to your live algo unless you stop the algorithm run a full backtest with the new code and redeploy if you manually stop a live trading algorithm this will shutdown the algorithm and prevent it from placing additional orders this will not liquidate your portfolio and any open orders will be handled by your broker as usual quantopians live trading program is still in open beta and the live trading platform has a number of limitations including different rules for each brokerage these limitations will be reduced and removed as we keep improving the live trading platform general guidelines  limitations algorithms that trade us equities can be traded with real money but futures are not yet available in brokerbacked trading the live trading platform does not have the capability to do a midday recovery from an outage if your algo goes down midday whether its because of our bug or your bug or a third party issue the algorithm wont automatically restart midday if the bug was temporary the algorithm will start the next day at market open on restart the data windows in history and pipeline will be filled with the missing data that passed during the previous days outage there is no automatic liquidation on algorithm exit if you need to liquidate your holdings you need to do that programatically in your algorithm or in the interactive brokers interface like in backtesting all open orders are cancelled at end of day orders made in the last minute of the trading day will be automatically cancelled if your algorithm uses fetchcsv it is important that all historical data in your fetched data be accessible and unchanged we do not keep a copy of fetched data it is reloaded at the start of every trading day if historical data in the fetched file is altered or removed the algorithm will not run properly providing additional new data in the file for dates in the future is fine if you are updating the csv add new data before midnight eastern time so the file is ready for the next trading day the use of random isnt supported because of technical limitations with our startofday initialization live trading is limited to accounts based in us dollars the account can be funded by other currencies but the base must be us dollars fundamentals data is typically updated on a daily basis occasionally data loads fail prior to the start of trading due to technical problems in these cases the data forward fills with the last known data point if your algorithm requires the most recent value be sure to include a data freshness check all metrics have an associated asof date available through the fundamentals api new ipo listings often arrive too late for incorporation in the daily trading data feed ipos may not be tradeable on their first day but are generally available for trading on subsequent trading days live trading is initially limited to accounts with a portfolio value of less than  contact us if you would like to trade more than  ib guidelines  limitations ib only allows one login at a time per account if you try to log into ib during market hours using the same account as quantopian quantopian will automatically try to force you out so that we can keep trading on your behalf in general we recommend that you maintain two logins one for quantopian and one for your use if you need to log in to ib using the quantopian login during market hours you should first stop the algorithm in quantopian if your ib login is terminated you will need to log back in before trading continues this could happen unexpectedly because of a server error or it could be a planned code upgrade on our part if a login is necessary we will contact you by default orders placed through quantopian use ibs smart router algorithm for order execution you can also specify to route your order to iex robinhood guidelines  limitations robinhood automatically handles order exchange routing you will not be able to specify an exchange importing ib specific modules or ibexchange is not supported similar modules for robinhood do not exist the following account fields are not available and will default to the backtest value regtequity regtmargin daytradesremaining cushion accruedinterest excessliquidity equitywithloan maintenancemarginrequirement initialmarginrequirement availablefunds accruedinterest we recommend that algorithms trading with robinhood follow a framework based off the two guidelines below robinhood only allows long orders that attempt to enter into a short position will be rejected by robinhood we strongly suggest you run your algorithms with the setlongonly trading guard to prevent you from accidentally running a strategy that depends on short positions cash value is equal to your settled funds plus your unsettled funds  your unsettled funds cannot be used to purchase securities this means that methods like ordertargetpercent will attempt to order on the value of your current positions as well as your total cash value unsettled  settled in some cases this will result in unexpected and unwanted behavior we recommend checking that all your funds have settled before placing any orders in order to prevent any confusion the best way to do that is to check your buying power against your cash as seen in the algorithm framework for robinhood robinhood margin accounts are currently in beta and are not supported in live trading please refer to robinhoods documentation for more information about margin accounts for ipos please refer to robinhoods documentation on trade availability we are working very hard at testing and improving our software however we certainly have software bugs as members of the open beta in particular you need to be alert to any bugs that might affect your trading bug

have a simple but powerful api for you to use initializecontext is a required setup method for initializing state or other bookkeeping this method is called only once at the beginning of your algorithm context is an augmented python dictionary used for maintaining state during your backtest or live trading session context should be used instead of global variables in the algorithm properties can be accessed using dot notation contextsomeproperty handledatacontext data is an optional method that is called every minute your algorithm uses data to get individual prices and windows of prices for one or more assets handledatacontext data should be rarely used most algorithm functions should be run in scheduled functions beforetradingstartcontext data is an optional method called once a day before the market opens your algorithm can select securities to trade using pipeline or do other onceperday calculations your algorithm can have other python methods for example you might have a scheduled function call a utility method to do some calculations for more information jump to the api documentation section below these core functions are also covered in core functions in the getting started tutorial manual asset lookup equities if you want to manually select an equity you can use the symbol function to look up a security by its ticker or company name using the symbol method brings up a search box that shows you the top results for your query to reference multiple securities in your algorithm call the symbols function to create a list of securities note the pluralization the function can accept a list of up to  securities and its parameters are not case sensitive sometimes tickers are reused over time as companies delist and new ones begin trading for example g used to refer to gillette but now refers to genpact if a ticker was reused by multiple companies use setsymbollookupdateyyyymmdd to specify what date to use when resolving conflicts this date needs to be set before any calls to symbol or symbols another option to manually enter securities is to use the sid function all securities have a unique security id sid in our system since symbols may be reused among exchanges this prevents any confusion and verifies you are calling the desired security you can use our sid method to look up a security by its id symbol or name in other words sid is equivalent to symbolaapl or apple quantopians backtester makes a best effort to automatically adjust the backtests start or end dates to accommodate the assets that are being used for example if youre trying to run a backtest with tesla in  the backtest will suggest you begin on june   the first day the security traded this ability is significantly decreased when using symbol instead of sid the symbol and symbols methods accept only string literals as parameters the sid method accepts only an integer literal as a parameter a static analysis is run on the code to quickly retrieve data needed for the backtest manually looking up equities is covered in referencing securities in the getting started tutorial futures to manually select a future in your algorithm you probably want to reference the corresponding continuous future continuous futures are objects that stitch together consecutive contracts of a particular underlying asset the continuousfuture function can be used to reference a continuous future the continuousfuture function has autocomplete similar to symbol continuous futures maintain a reference to the active contract of an underlying asset but cannot themselves be traded to trade a particular future contract you can get the current contract of a continuous future this is covered in the futures tutorial futures contracts can be looked up manually with futuresymbol by passing a string for the particular contract eg futuresymbolclf this is uncommon outside of research given the short lifetime of contracts trading calendars before running an algorithm you will need to select which calendar you want to trade on currently there are two calendars the us equities calendar and the us futures calendar the us equity calendar runs weekdays from ampm eastern time and respects the us stock market holiday schedule including partial days futures trading is not supported on the us equity calendar the us futures calendar runs weekdays from ampm eastern time and respects the futures exchange holidays observed by all us futures us new years day good friday christmas trading futures and equities are both supported on the us futures calendar to choose a calendar select it from the dropdown in the ide before running a backtest scheduling functions your algorithm will run much faster if it doesnt have to do work every single minute we provide the schedulefunction method that lets your algorithm specify when methods are run by using date andor time rules all scheduling must be done from within the initialize method def initializecontext schedulefunction funcmyfunc dateruledateruleseveryday timeruletimerulesmarketcloseminutes halfdaystrue  for a condensed introduction to scheduling functions check out the scheduling functions lesson in the getting started tutorial monthly modes monthstart and monthend accept a daysoffset parameter to offset the function execution by a specific number of trading days from the beginning and end of the month respectively in monthly mode all day calculations are done using trading days for your selected trading calendar if the offset exceeds the number of trading days in a month the function isnt run during that month weekly modes weekstart and weekend also accept a daysoffset parameter if the function execution is scheduled for a market holiday and there is at least one more trading day in the week the function will run on the next trading day if there are no more trading days in the week the function is not run during that week specific times for relative rules such as market open or market close will depend on the calendar that is selected before running a backtest if you would like to schedule a function according to the time rules of a different calendar you can specify a calendar argument to specify a calendar you must import calendars from the quantopianalgorithm module if calendarsusequities is used market open is usually am et

funcmyfunc dateruledateruleseveryday timeruletimerulesmarketcloseminutes calendarcalendarsusequities  to schedule a function more frequently you can use multiple schedulefunction calls for instance you can schedule a function to run every  minutes every three days or at the beginning of the day and the middle of the day scheduled functions are not asynchronous if two scheduled functions are supposed to run at the same time they will happen sequentially in the order in which they were created note the handledata function runs before any functions scheduled to run in the same minute also scheduled functions have the same timeout restrictions as handledata ie the total amount of time taken up by handledata and any scheduled functions for the same minute cant exceed  seconds below are

is stale check if an asset can be traded in the current minute based on volume get the current contract of a continuous future get the forward looking chain of contracts for a continuous future the data object knows your algorithms current time and uses that time for all its internal calculations all the methods on data accept a single asset or a list of assets and the price fetching methods also accept an ohlcv field or a list of ohlcv fields the more that your algorithm can batch up queries by passing multiple assets or multiple fields the faster we can get that data to your algorithm learn about the various methods on the data object in the api documentation below the data object is also covered in the getting started tutorial and the futures tutorial getting price data for securities one of the most common actions your algorithm will do is fetch price and volume information for one or more securities quantopian lets you get this data for a specific minute or for a window of minutes to get data for a specific minute use datacurrent and pass it one or more securities and one or more fields the data returned will be the astraded values for examples of getting current data and a list of possible fields see the getting started tutorial equities or the futures tutorial futures datacurrent can also be used to find the last minute in which an asset traded by passing lasttraded as the field name to get data for a window of time use datahistory and pass it one or more assets one or more fields m or d for granularity of data and the number of bars the data returned for equities will be adjusted for splits mergers and dividends as of the current simulation time important things to know price is forwardfilled returning last known price if there is one otherwise nan is returned volume returns  if the security didnt trade or didnt exist during a given minute for open high low and close a nan is returned if the security didnt trade or didnt exist at the given minute dont save the results of datahistory from one day to the next your history call today is priceadjusted relative to today and your history call from yesterday was adjusted relative to yesterday to read about all the details go to the api documentation history getting historical data is covered in the getting started tutorial and the futures tutorial in many strategies it is useful to compare the most recent bar data to previous bars the quantopian platform provides utilities to easily access and perform calculations on recent history when your algorithm calls datahistory on equities the returned data is adjusted for splits mergers and dividends as of the current simulation date in other words when your algorithm asks for a historical window of prices and there is a split in the middle of that window the first part of that window will be adjusted for the split this adustment is done so that your algorithm can do meaningful calculations using the values in the window this code queries the last  days of price history for a static set of securities specifically this returns the closing daily price for the last  days including the current price for the current day equity prices are split and dividendadjusted as of the current date in the simulation def initializecontext  aapl msft and spy contextassets  sid sid sid def handledatacontext data pricehistory  datahistorycontextassets fieldsprice barcount frequencyd the barcount field specifies the number of days or minutes to include in the pandas dataframe returned by the history function this parameter

examples below are examples of code along with explanations of the data returned daily history use d for the frequency the dataframe returned is always in daily bars the bars never span more than one trading day for us equities a daily bar captures the trade activity during market hours usually ampm et for us futures a daily bar captures the trade activity from pmpm et  hours for example the monday daily bar captures trade activity from pm the day before sunday to pm on the monday tuesdays daily bar will run from pm monday to pm tuesday etc for either asset class the last bar if partial is built using the minutes of the current day examples assuming contextassets exists datahistorycontextassets price  d returns the current price datahistorycontextassets volume  d returns the volume since the current days open even if it is partial datahistorycontextassets price  d returns yesterdays close price and the current price datahistorycontextassets price  d returns the prices for the previous  days and the current price partial trading days are treated as a single day unit scheduled half day sessions unplanned early closures for unusual circumstances and other truncated sessions

datahistorycontextassets price  m returns the previous minutes close price and the current price datahistorycontextassets volume  m returns the volume for the previous  minutes note if you request a history of minute data that extends past the start of the day am on the equities calendar am on the futures calendar the datahistory function will get the remaining minute bars from the end of the previous day for example if you ask for  minutes of pricing data at am on the equities calendar the first  prices will be from the end of the previous trading day and the next  will be from the current morning returned data if a single security and a single field were passed into datahistory a pandas series is returned indexed by date if multiple securities and single field are passed in the returned pandas dataframe is indexed by date and has assets as columns if a single security and multiple fields are passed in the returned pandas dataframe is indexed by date and has fields as columns if multiple assets and multiple fields are passed in the returned pandas panel is indexed by field has date as the major axis and securities as the minor axis all pricing data is split and dividendadjusted as of the current date in the simulation or live trading as a result pricing data returned by datahistory should not be stored and past the end of the day on which it was retreived as it may no longer be correctly adjusted price is always forwardfilled the other fields open high low close volume are never forwardfilled history and backtest start quantopians price data starts on jan   any datahistory call that extends before that date will raise an exception common usage current and previous bar a common use case is to compare yesterdays close price with the current price this

world using a nuanced platform approach by alex moazed alex moazed is the ceo of applico a marketplace advisory company which he founded with credit cards in college moazed advises companies such as google and those in venture capital firm highland capitals portfolio on platform innovation and has developed more than  apps alexmoazed founder and ceo applicoalexmoazed write a comment credit getty images hailed as the rocket scientists of wall street quantitative analysts have come to replace gut instinct as the engines of investment decisions virtually anyone can learn the skills necessary to become a quant and guide investment but quants are largely consolidated at investment firms due to the difficulty of accessing viable capital for investment quantopian is radicalizing the future of finance and trading by removing that traditional barrier to entry founder and ceo john  fawce fawcett founded this crowdsourced quantitative investment platform with the goal of allowing anyone with coding skills and an appetite for finance to start writing investment algorithms and making money accordingly fawcett saw the substantial inefficiencies in finance and wanted to create a community of quants that could circumvent these problems while it took five years of hard work quantopian is now wellestablished in the finance world with a clear trajectory for growth quantastic quantopian has designed a loyalty agreement in which the quants are paid independently based on their performance which is defined through the quality of their algorithms and the performance of funds invested in those algorithms the research development and execution environment at quantopian is what makes its platform so unique quants also known as authors are provided with everything they need to create their algorithm quantopian operates in an openended python environment offering free access to stock price history consolidated databases corporate fundamental data sets and several apis among other resources all for the purpose of empowering the quants the startup also provides integrated development and execution environments that allow for the quants to test their algorithms for free then move it into a realworld setting to start informing trades after the algorithm has been created and deployed quantopian evaluates each individuals algorithm and if the author agrees to license his or her algorithm to quantopian allocates funds accordingly to the best based on the algorithms capabilities and features quantopian manages these algorithms for the benefit of investors in its vehicles essentially acting as the intermediary between the quant and investor to incentivize their continued involvement on the platform and to make highquality algorithms quants are eligible to receive  of the net profits generated by their algorithm if it is selected for allocation counter to the rest of the financial world quantopian doesnt follow a traditional model but rather structures its fees and loyalties to motivate the best quant authors once the algorithms are accepted for investment the quants are asked to standardize their algorithm so that they no longer need to tend to it once its in use quantopian has an operations team that handles and manages all algorithm issues after their completion the quants need do nothing more  they can merely wait for their royalty to be awarded through this procedure many quants can still focus on their fulltime job while enjoying the fruits of their labor from quantopian a great deal quantopian has more than  in its network and continues to grow its base both for investors and for quants while the startup is unable to deploy investment capital into every quants algorithm and deliver compensation the core draw for the community is not solely based on making money the main reason people join the quantopian network is because they want to learn about quantitative finance naturally a large amount of people lack experience in finance but understand software plenty well quantopian allows for these engineers to build a product and gain exposure to a field previously unknown to them by offering a place to test and experiment their ideas according to fawce word of mouth has been the leading source for recruiting new quants the community has doubled yearoveryear including finance professionals scientists developers and students from all over the world quantopian has soared so quickly because fawce and his team have identified the value the company can bring to the quants writing algorithms and investors looking for an alternative means of investment the biggest wellspring of bloat in finance is the allocation and reallocation of capital which quantopian strives to balance by reducing the search and transaction costs associated with finding the right investment opportunity fawce envisions a time when quants can subsist from the funds delivered by their algorithms by the end of the calendar year quantopian hopes to allocate up to  million per algorithm which is enough for a reasonably sustainable income especially considering that it involves very low labor in the long run investing for the future what makes quantopians business model so fascinating is that it functions as a onesided platform a market with crowdsourced production and curated consumption for now fawce is satisfied with that approach because hes focused on making the investments work out for everyone will quantopian take itself out of the matchmaking environment by becoming a doublesided platform allowing quants to market to investors its possible but not a priority at the moment quantopians viewpoint on this matter is that the approach of people finding one another is not really feasible under the current regime the quants are often software engineers and dont have many investment connections or sophisticated marketing experience instead quantopian investment managers act as fiduciaries for the investors in its funds handling the selection of algorithms allocation distribution and execution quantopian demonstrates a strong potential to alter the future of hedge fund management by carving out an original role in an increasingly techdriven financial industry the industry is undergoing radical changes as it transitions from a traditional discretionary model toward highly automated systematic quantitative investments this platform might create a new path for hedge funds in which outside managers participate in the quantopian community by connecting these algorithms to the investments they can best serve there is a bright path ahead for quantopian as its business model is completely unique not found anywhere else there are quantitative hedge funds in place but none of them have a comparable platform community powering the decisionmaking quantopian plans to scale over the rest of the year quantopians approach isnt a platform from end to end but fawce and his cohort have a clear vision for where the onesided platform should go itll be exciting to see whats next for the startup the opinions expressed here by inccom columnists are their own not those of inccom published on jun
