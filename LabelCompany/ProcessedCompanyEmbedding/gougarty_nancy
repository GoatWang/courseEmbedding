now turn the call over to nancy gougarty please goahead maam nancy gougarty thank you very much good afternoon and thank you for joining us to discuss westport fuel systems first quarter results today were speaking for our third full quarter as a combined company the past  months have not been without their challenges but today i am more confident than ever that the company is on the right path to becoming a sustainable profitable company that can deliver value to customers employees and shareholders when i first spoke to you last august we laid our several clear goals firstly focus on our product portfolio and sell noncore assets secondly align our cost and revenue and capture the benefits and synergies of the merger thirdly improve our balance sheet and fourthly the advancement in bringing hpdi  to market i am pleased to be able to report that we have made substantial progress on the path to meet these goals and while we continue to focus on achieving these goals we remain agile and ready to ensure that we are able to adapt to everchanging business environment we have made the decision to exit our industrial business the first step of which was the sale of our apu assets the decision was a result of a comprehensive review of our entire portfolio that began last summer the industrial segment is a good business that is it adjusted ebitda positive however when we looked at our core skills the competitive dynamics of the end markets the size of competitors this knowledge plus our thorough assessment made our decision clear for westport fuel systems to exit this segment though it is taking time we are purposeful and deliberate to ensure that westport fuel systems gets the maximum shareholder value for these industrial assets the cash received through the apu asset sale is meaningful and improves our balance sheet it also allows us to concentrate on growing market share for our unmatched proprietary alternative fuel technology as well as bring new products to market that can drive results for the long term it is our knowledge technical expertise deep portfolio oem relationship that make westport fuel system the global leader in our markets turning to slide  as you know i have more than  years experience working in the truck and automotive industry but you can see in this slide we have assembled an executive team that brings similar knowledge to what it takes to be a tier  supplier to a global oem and were working together to deliver operational excellence for our entire global organization on slide  i would like to spend some more time talking about the new westport fuel system and what we consider is our core portfolio as our highest value statement this focus comes from our portfolio reviews our global automotive segment is delivering improved operational performance with higher adjusted ebitda contribution the cummins westport joint venture which showcases our technology and how to partner with the leading oem is also paying us quarterly dividends and thirdly our corporate and technology segment including hpdi and other technologies in this segment  is a milestone year as well be shipping our first hpdi  commercial components later this year this will provide our first commercial revenue and allow us to dramatically reduce our rd cost this is a key step in turning this segment into a profitable contributor to our bottom line moving to slide  the automotive segment the automotive segment provides a range of products for propane natural gas and even hydrogen this is a global business with europe representing about  of the sales followed by the americas and asia at approximately  each and the us representing approximately  of the automotive revenue as a global business each region has its own characteristics fuel price differential government policy and fueling infrastructures we understand the specific market characteristics in order to best serve them since the merger closed we have taken several initiatives to improve our competitiveness in the market these actions include consolidating our operating footprint reducing our operating costs and restructuring our global purchasing and inventory system the results have been an improvement in adjusted ebitda with a business that is more in line with its current revenue and positioned to benefit when the market fully recovers on to slide  our cummins joint venture westport joint venture delivers consistent dividends even with challenges of oil prices we are also excited with the initial response of our zeroequipment emissions engine and the joint venture continue to provide a stream of earnings plus potentials for years to come ashoka will talk more about cwi in his section and turning to our corporate and technology segment this segment is where we have developed new technologies for the transportation industry including hpdi  as seen on slide  this is the most immediate and exciting technology that we have right now and later this year well be shipping our first commercial component to our launch partner this is a combination of many years of dedicated and determined work to bring hpdi  to market i am proud to say that the team has worked through challenging that have come with bringing new technology to market we have taken the setbacks and lessons learned in build off of them in order to provide better product we have met the rigorous standards that our oem partners and customers demand and are excited to provide a gamechanging technology that will allow users to reduce their fuel cost while making a meaningful reduction in their greenhouse gas emissions our oem partners plan to launch the technology in the european market where the heavyduty truck shipment typically ranges between  to  units per year and the taxes cheap diesel prices elevated and greenhouse gas reductions are valued more than another market i cant overstate the importance of this milestone for the company bringing new revenue streams in for component sales and licensing revenue and also allowing us to reduce significantly our rd spending this first program was unique and we needed to make a substantial investment to develop and bring to market this first of kind technology as we work with other oems however our work book continues to be funded by these partners and commercial opportunities known for example we just recently executed a development agreement and beginning work with a leading oem to develop their engine using technology to meet their countrys new emission rule similar to euro  our oem customer came to for our industry knowledge our engine development technical expertise proven components and engine management system plus our track record we have clear scope of what needs to be accomplished and we are funded for the entire project and there is a clear path for a supply agreement this is the way that the new westport fuel systems will be working before i turn the call over to andrea and ashoka i want to reiterate that we are excited and energized as we lead the shift in the global transportation system from petroleum to clean gaseous fuels of all forms we do this by commercializing our unique technologies bringing to market no compromised products that offer compelling emissions and greenhouse gas reductions we have the fundamentals in place and westport fuel systems is moving in the right direction with that andrea over to you andrea alghisi thank you nancy now starting on slide  as youve seen in our financial statements all of our industrial segment is now recorded in discontinued operations so my comments will be about our global automotive segment please note that our global automotive segment now includes the electronic business as well as the highpressure components which had previously been included in industrial all numbers shown have been adjusted to reflect their addition my comments will compare the first quarter of  to the fourth quarter of  because the merger did not occur until june  the results of the first quarter of  are less meaningful for comparative purposes as nancy stated since the close of the merger we have undertaken a number of initiatives to improve our operating performance and reduce our costs this is included for our stats like consolidating our operating footprint and eliminating redundancies but also exploiting technical levers like product redesign and make versus buy and commercial levers like strategic sourcing and supplier negotiation to improve product competitiveness we have additional efforts underway and we have implemented a program of operational excellence my colleagues and i have learned over years in the industry you cannot control market cycles government policies or commodity prices you can only control how you operate and deliver to your clients now turning to the performance in the first quarter revenues were down from the fourth quarter due to weaker sales in the compressor business and in the highpressure business as well however leaseback performance to recover in the second quarter gross margin of  were arrived from prior quarters as a result of the efforts to better control our product cost i am pleased to report that our adjusted ebitda for the automotive segment was  million or  a significant improvement from prior quarters and a reflection of the efforts and actions taken since the merger closed as we look out at the rest of the year we currently see stable markets and expect automotive segment revenues of between  million and  million looking at  there are some outstanding tenders that could provide some tailwinds while there are some market that might weaken and there is a potential for some of our new programs to push into early  if the oem delay them so those could be some advantage please note that there is some seasonality in this business as well and all the squeal we expect higher revenues in the first half versus the second half and typically the september quarter is the weakest due to summer holidays and production changeovers when we look at our automotive segment we expect and target these as a pattern between  and  adjusted ebitda margin business with volumes product mix product cost and topic efficiency as the key drivers of the range we have initiatives underway to improve our adjusted ebitda margin and we are targeting to be well within that range in  and beyond ill now turn the call over to you ashoka ashoka achuthan thank you andrea my comments begin on slide  as of march  we had cash and cash equivalents of  million down from  million at the yearend this does not include the cash we received as a part of the sale of our apu assets which as you know closed on the  april while the gross proceeds of that transactions were  million our net proceeds were approximately  million after transaction fees deal costs and a holdback of  million with the release milestones over the next  months after the deal closed we made an  million prepayment of royalties payable to address our collateral obligation to caucasian capital with respect to the sale of the second noncore asset i can say that we are in active negotiations with the potential buyer please note that the industrial businesses are now reflected as discontinued operations in our financials the first fourth quarter revenues for these businesses were  million and had they not been reported as discontinued operations our first quarter revenue would have been  million we are also ahead of our initial scheduled for capturing synergies from the merger and now expect to exceed the original  million run rate savings target by the end of  at the bottom of the slide youll see our consolidated adjusted ebitda for the current and the past four quarters which shows a loss of  million in the first quarter of  were seeing a positive trend however i do want to point out that the first quarter was helped by an hpdi program progress payment and also the timing of certain expenses we do not expect the second quarter to be strong  as strong as the first as we do not have a similar progress payment and we have some higher development costs basically the  quarterly adjusted ebitda is going to fluctuate as we work through the final stages of the commercial launch of hpdi  but what is important is that were moving fast towards profitability and expect to be adjusted ebitda positive in early  now turning on to slide  which shows our cwi joint venture revenues and shipments were up from the first quarter of  on improved performance in the us offset by continued weakness in certain international markets gross margins were  up from the first quarter of  primarily due to lower warranty costs which are now at more normalized levels rd expenses of  million are higher due to engine development costs cwi has evaluated rd and sales and marketing costs over the past two years as the company launched its near liter engine spent rd dollars to incorporate onboard diagnostics and develop the new zero equivalent emission engines we are almost through this higher spent however and by the second half well be trending back towards spending levels seen in prior years cwis new  product line is a very significant milestone in product development for the company these new engines mean our customers can choose the most affordable pack to zero equivalent emissions with no commercial constraints of supply or technology readiness i know some of you on the call attended the act show in long beach last week and you may have firsthand the owner operator feedback we think these engines are game changing and are excited about the prospects for the joint venture in the coming years turning to slide  which shows our sga rd expenses from continuing operations by segment our sga costs are trending down however the first quarter  was impacted by increased advisory fees and transaction related costs rightsizing our cost structure remains a key priority as an example we had another round of headcount reductions in march and we will continue to take appropriate steps needed to align our costs with our revenues rd spending was  million down from prior quarters in part due to timing but a majority was the result of actions taken to focus our rd efforts as in prior quarters corporate and technology segment accounted for the largest component of rd mostly related to our hpdi  program for the next three quarters of  we expect to see similar levels of rd spending through launch after which the spending will drop off considerably we expect  rd spend for our corporate and technology segments to be at about half the levels of  of course new programs could add to this but as nancy made very clear any new rd programs in our corporate and technology segment will be funded by third parties turning to slide  which shows our quarterly cash walk starting with  million at december   we received  million in dividends from joint venture spent  million in net credit paydowns spent  million on restructuring payments had an increase of  million working capital capital expenditures were down was  million down slightly from recent quarters due to timing we expect to spend an additional  million in capital expenditures in the rest of this year of which about  million will be spent in the second quarter this spend is needed to successfully launch hpdi  to meet our launch timing and to be able to service our current launch partner and future hpdi programs for other oems its an investment in our future but it is not regarding amount much like rd it is limited to  we expect to spend only  million on capital expenditures in all of  most of which is related to maintenance spend for our global automotive business our cash used in operations was approximately  million we closed the quarter at  million which as i mentioned earlier does not include the cash we received from the recent asset sale moving on to slide  as andrea said we expect our automotive revenues to be between  million and  million for  revenues from the industrial segment including any related to the transition agreement will be recorded as discontinued operations with the sale of our industrial segment we do lose some adjusted ebitda contribution however i want to reiterate what i said on our last call that our goal of reaching adjusted ebitda breakeven and then on to full profitability remains our most pressing target and we expect to be adjusted ebitda positive on a consolidated basis in early  finally we will compete our actions to address our balance sheet were off to a very good start in  in march we refinanced the € million european credit facility for five years at similar terms in april we received a net of € million from the sale of our apu business we do have approximately  million of debentures coming due in september but weve been approaching this from multiple angles and the cash received from the recent asset sales only expands our options we are in discussions with the existing holders about rolling over or extending all or some of the debentures were also far along at other options including refinancing them through additional asset sales cash from potential licensing agreements a new loan or credit facility or capital market transactions and it is possible that the solution will be a combination of all of these elements what is important to note however is that were looking for a finite amount that is not an openended need for more cash while we develop new technologies we have two strong businesses that are sources of cash flow and value and we had hpdi technology that we believe will start producing significant value for westport fuel systems in the coming years we have and we will take  continue to take the necessary steps to put the company on a sustainable path the options i listed will be a bridge to  when we will be adjusted ebitda positive with growing hpdi  revenues and our legacy restructuring spend behind us with that ill turn the call over to the operator for questions questionandanswer session operator well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question comes from rob brown with lake street capital markets please go ahead rob brown good afternoon andrea alghisi good afternoon rob brown just wondering if you  on hpdi program youre talking about shipping later this year could you maybe just give us some parameters about how that kind of ramps into  is it initial product this year and then production product next year can you give us some idea of how that hpdi program ramps andrea alghisi nancy would you like to take that nancy gougarty yes i will  ive got some  rob first of all thanks for your question and as you know were really quite excited about whats going on with hpdi but the way it rolls out in calendar year  we are building some early protection units and then rolling into what we call regular production but our oem partner will be i think shortly here making some announcements related to the actual marketing plans so were preparing our suppliers and preparing and getting the supply system ready in part q in order for us to meet these initial builds that will happen in the latter part of calendar year  rob brown okay good thank you thats helpful and then on the other hpdi programs youre working on could you give us a sense of how many are active at the moment and maybe give us a some sense on when they on the timeline is for product much is there nancy gougarty well a couple things to be said i think that as were working in terms of hpdi what were finding is that the transportation and the tracking piece is one of it but were also finding some very interesting dynamic from off vehicle application as well as in rail so i would be  i think a bit remiss to give you the total numbers that were working with several people in these various areas i would tell you that the good news is that because weve done all the heavy lifting relative to the validation and reliability testing for all the hpdi components the good news is its now getting the products to market because its application work in these circumstances were able to get the product to market in a much quicker fashion than what we did with our original launch which meant that we had to do all the component validation and then do the vehicle validation activity in addition to that so i think that what you will see is over the next years several opportunities that can rollout now it really again as you know were the tier  so this is really up to the oems relative to how they want to put this product in their portfolio but i would say in general were highly encouraged relative to hpdi being a technology that is key for their alternate fuel technology primarily because it has such good performance relative to the diesel product rob brown okay and then just one more quick question on the rd spending i think you mentioned that corporate spending will come down by about half once that hpi program rolls down whats kind of the baseline there of spending that youre running at ashoka achuthan yeah let me take that rob weve obviously not released figures or guided to figures for rd spend but you can expect our ongoing spend to be somewhere you can tracking to about half the levels that youre seeing in the corporate and technology segment today rob brown okay good thank you ill turn it over operator the next question comes from eric stine with craighallum please go ahead eric stine hi everyone listen nancy you just answered a part of this question but related to that new oem agreement that you just disclosed today and given that its at  in that platform and it speeds the timeframe are you able to kind of give some thought about when you think that could move from development to supply agreement may be too early but just wondering if you could provide any color there nancy gougarty first of all eric thanks for the question let me try to answer this and i think there are some other folks in the room that probably can chime in but part of the development agreement we have to find in there that actually moves us into a supply agreement arrangement and i would anticipate that thats going to happen within calendar year  that the supply agreement activity will get going again what we wanted  i think its important that we are a full system and full solution provider meaning that we really what in addition to being able to do the development work we want to supply agreements to go along with it so as i stated so the new westport both getting customer funding but also making sure that were able to bring meaningful revenues through is really been key to us so we have now structured our agreements in phases in order for us to be allowed and to ensure that the supply agreement is going to come along with the development activity ashoka achuthan the only thing i would add to that is this is ashoka the only thing i would add to that is this is not an hpdi program that we were reporting to eric stine okay understood okay good that is helpful and then maybe just turning to hpdi given that you are approaching volumes initial volumes with your lead customer just curious is that  have you noticed any other oems that are moving faster as a result is a c volvo about to come to market nancy gougarty i would tell you that each oem has their own view relative to this and we had lots of discussion with them about it fits into their portfolio i would say more highly encouraged in the european market that because of some greenhouse gas and co initiatives that were going to see it more in the nearterm but again as we always continue to say eric and will continue this is the oem that meets their launch timing relative to this i would say as i mentioned in my comment to rob that we are really very pleased because of the fact that we get such comparable performance in terms of range as well as for vehicle performance to diesel that this provides  this alternate technology has lots of advantages over other things that oems can initiate so that is one of the things at least on the trucking side that were finding to be one of the calling card thats making it really interesting eric stine right okay so maybe last one for me and i did jump on late so i apologize if you touched on this but the industrial piece and discontinuing that should we take this as a that there are certainly more to come or at least that would be your objective nancy gougarty so eric in the showcase portion he did mention that were in the last were in negotiations with party to sell another portion of our industrial asset eric stine right okay so you had previously talked about to you solely puc you have the other one i was just curious do you see within industrial others beyond that or is the one noncore asset sales that youre in final stages does that incorporate the rest of the industrial the discontinued operations nancy gougarty right now the only thing thats in discontinued operation is those that are part of the industrial group but i would tell you that we continue to look at our portfolio and there are some other opportunities and again in certain cases were looking for some market opportunity for them and as they become ready for us to move out into the market we will certainly let you know that eric stine okay thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from jeff osborne with cowen and company please go ahead jeff osborne hey good afternoon couple questions on my end i was wondering if you could talk about the cwi near zero engine any sense of preliminary interest or backlog is open that part a of the question and then for ashoka how should we be thinking about in  gross margins for cwi as that engine ramps up is there a larger warranty reserve and then we should be factoring that into our assumptions ashoka achuthan thanks for your question jeff let me take the first one first which is interest in the zero equivalent engines that cws just launched as you know the liter product is available today and the liter version of the zeroequivalent engine with the launch later this year or very early next year very positive reaction i dont know if you were there at the act in long beach last week but we were extremely impressed with customer reaction people see it as a game changer and most importantly it offers them a real alternative to zero equivalent  as a zeroequivalent option with no commercial constraints to supply all technological readiness compared to the other zero option  zero emission options that may be available so very positive and we expect that to contribute very favorably to both the topline on the bottom line going forward your second question on the gross margins year we expect to see continuing strength on gross margins as these engines come on stream but more significantly we expect our operating margins to improve because of that used to ongoing rd spend as you know the past year and this year have been significantly impacted by the spend related to the development of these engines both the new liter engine as well as the zero equivalent versions of the  and the  liters and plus a fair amount of engineering spend related to ongoing  onboard diagnostics which are required for engines in  once that will be behind us which we expect will happen in the middle of this year you can see a significant drop off for both rd and sga spend going forward as well jeff osborne got it thats helpful maybe one for andrea or anyone can jump but is there a sense on the automotive side that you could give the rough mix that you expect or you saw in  on a combined basis for the two companies what the mix is of delayed oem and retrofit kits for the vehicles andrea alghisi thank you jeff for your questions and i heard correctly the ike asking for  or  jeff osborne maybe just i am just curious what the rough mix is maybe in the quarter for  would be helpful i dont need exact numbers but just a perspective of what you anticipate between those three segments andrea alghisi well i would say that the  of our business is after market and lets say the other  is share among lets say d businesses so one is oem the second is delayed oem and the third one is what we call diversified businesses so the oem is another together with the delayed om is another lets say   and the last  is diversified businesses some of them are complementary because they are for example we have what we call a service business which allows us to give more revenue stream to our dealers in italy jeff osborne got it and ashoka any sense of perspective of the remaining assets that you had sell in terms of size is that half the size or similar to what youve already done with the ate segment my assumption is its much smaller but i just wanted to if you had any comments on that ashoka achuthan not unreasonable as i mentioned jeff bear in mind we have reclassified almost the entire piece of the industrial segment as discontinued operations so you can draw your own conclusions from that in terms of what is left after the apu sales there is a very small piece of the form industrial business the rolls into automotive and that has to do with electronics but as nancy mentioned besides these we have a couple of businesses that are potentially noncore as well jeff osborne makes sense the last one quick i saw the automotive

nancy gougarty  is ceo of vancouverbased westport fuel systems which makes alternativefuel systems and components such as natural gas engines before westport ms gougarty was vicepresident of trw automotive corp’s asiapacific operations she started her career as an industrial engineer at the packard electric division of general motors she has a bachelor of science in industrial management from the university of cincinnati i was born in berkeley calif but ohio is where i was mostly based growing up i have three older brothers and one younger sister my father a nuclear physicist was a university professor and a researcher we moved a lot he would work nine months in his teaching assignment and took on research opportunities during the summers and took sabbaticals which allowed us to live in interesting places around the worldone of his assignments was to the university of saskatchewan we lived in saskatoon for  months i was in the seventh and eighth grades that was my first real winter i don’t think i’ve been through another one like that since we also lived in australia when my father spent some time at the university of melbourne needless to say i changed schools quite a bitmoving around a lot as a kid showed me the world is  degrees you also get to know who you are it’s almost like starting over each time you get to tell people what they know about you they have no history it made me realize that behaviour and power of speech matter and need to be managedi didn’t really know what i wanted to do for a career when i was growing up my parents didn’t pressure us to figure it out they had the attitude that we would find our way in life they didn’t want us to work during high school and university they felt that was our time to be free my first fulltime job was after graduation that’s when i started my career with general motors in warren ohioi called them generous motors i worked there for  years in a few different divisions – everything from engineering and sales to recruiting and finance i was also able to obtain my executive mba while working there and while mothering three childrenhaving the opportunity to live in lots of different places as a kid made me more willing to do that in my career i spent nearly  years of my career in asia most of which was in china shanghai remains a special place for our familyas a leader i like to go and see people in person i can’t manage remotely i can’t make decisions based only on email or phone calls people can have very polished emails also in my experience you can’t liken someone’s speaking skills to their capability i spend more than  per cent of my time outside of headquarters when you’re in the room you can read body language you can see comfort or discomfort you can see happiness or sadness there are also different nuances in different countries doing business in china has a very different nuance versus india versus italymy husband enabled my career success to date he never held me back saying “we have three kids you can’t do that” instead he would say “if that’s what you want go for it” the two of us always tried to figure out together what was best i never felt constrained i wanted to be a wife a mother i wanted everything and he enabled a good bit of thati’m a person who likes to get things done i don’t really have limits on the kinds of things i’m willing to do i can type my own presentations i’m pretty selfsufficient i describe myself as a roadblock remover i think as a leader my job is to get those speed bumps as low as possible or remove whatever is blocking the roadi see my job as making sure i understand the whole voice of the organization you can get very insulated at the topi have a good memory people say “don’t tell her anything you don’t want her to remember”some people might say i move too fast without enough facts my opinion is that a bad decision is better than a perfect decision as long as it keeps up momentum i’m not sure with the kind of speed in the business environment we’re in today that we have the luxury of waiting for the perfect decisioni make mistakes and i readily admit it i sense that we have to move quickly and swift and when it’s not right we’ll fix it people also need to be able to tell me it’s not right that means having an environment where people can tell me “that wasn’t your best decision”i’m very happy with where i am today i’d like to continue to make westport fuels systems even more successful i also want to learn to laugh more and enjoy life moreas told to brenda bouw this interview has been edited
