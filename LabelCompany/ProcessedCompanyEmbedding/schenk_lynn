reviews rigney jon d law offices of apcniloofarfarboodi ratedbest family attorney in sdjon d rigney is absolutely one of the best lawyers in san diego his long term experience intelligence and his ability to interpret the facts and present them in the most straightforward and useful way is absolutely amazing i am a citizen of iran who came to the united states with a dependent visa on my iraniancanadian husband however upon our arrival he started making my life terribly difficult and finally he went for a divorce and made up stories to get rid of paying me the spousal support i was so helpless and also unable to work in the us due to visa limitations and i thought that was the end of the world and i was about to leave the us without asking for any rights out of our marriage leave the graduate program i was attending in usc and go back to iran however upon a series of consultation sessions with mr rigney that only costed  in total he made me realize that i have been the victim of domestic violence and thats why i was about to give up on all my rights and leave he advised me to just stay and tell him the story of my life with the abusive husband and step by step he moved me forward up to the point that in our first spousal support hearing i was granted half of the salary of my spouse as the support which happens very rarely in california judge jessop and attorney jon d rigney did a great job in giving life and hope back to me especially mr rigney had also a psychological role to help me see the facts and try to save myself from remaining in a victims position i owe a lot to this lawyer he is defenitely not a cheap lawyer but he deserves what he gets he knows his job perfectly and he is a very respected person i highly recommend him to people who have family issues whether they are american or from any other nationalities like me he also have a very carying and smart staff and paralegal team who are always there to help you with your legal questionsmens legal centeryourmagazineusa ratedmens legal centerthe name on the door pretty much says it all  mens legal center they are advocates for family law advocates for mens rights the bottom line is and it is so rarely heard in our society but the facts show abused men are the hidden side of domestic violence california state university professor martin summarizes some  empirical studies and  reviews andor analyses to conclude women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partnerswe men often lose out in a biased society and seemingly unfriendly courts yet fathers have rights too i think most men in general realize this yet remain silent come on how many of us are really going to admit to anybody that our wife smacked us around we should but we dont until it is often too late the mens legal center however has been doing something about it since  by providing both legal and nonlegal counseling services and referrals for men and women whom are victims of domestic violence legal services run the gamut from prenuptial agreements to divorce and everything in between including paternity tests and legal services annulment restraining orders wills and trusts and alternative dispute resolutions to divorce most importantly however they help men assert often trampled rights in child custody visitation and support the san diego chapter of the national coalition for men operates out of the same building and the center provides a monthly newsletter with parenting and cooking advice annual picnics and extensive unbiased resources for men in need of support testimonials are very supportive and the staff is super friendly payment terms are reasonable and the attorneys will work with you the mens legal center appears to be the real deal genuinely concerned with your rightsbloom allen r attorney at lawmuchlis w ratedastute and righteous attorney this is a felony case with ist incompetent to stand trial situation at the end we got everything that we wanted and my wife did not spend any day in custody after the first hearing this matters the most he kept informed me with his thought process  he responded to my email regardless of time night  weekend because he is looking out for our interest he did not settle quickly he recommended to reject the da offer for plea bargain the entire case lasted  year when i contacted allen my wife had been charged with a felony case and was deemed ist and was sent to state hospital for up to  years the worst part is all ist persons have to wait in county jail for months before being transfer to state hospital jail cannot take care of mentally ill person  i was absolutely devastated  my wife was so sick and by the time she got to the hospital she could not walk allen helped speed her transfer from county jail to the hospital after  weeks see freddy mille case after  months allen drove  miles to visit my wife and interviewed her with the intent to speed up her release and later let the hospital know that she could assist him in her defense after the first court hearing my wife was pretty much out from custody since then again this counted the most  i did not have to post another bail during the series of hearing my prev attorney screwed up in the proceeding allen recommended going through the criminal path by not pleading guilty due to insanity  mental illness  that was a good call he told me the strategy for my wife by staying out of trouble visiting psychiatric and lengthen the hearing looking back he made all the right call thank you allen law tigersbrett s ratedi was lane splitting when a car did an abrupt lane change not using her blinker my bike was totalled and i had to have surgery on my shoulder i was a nervous wreck not knowing how to handle all this insurance and legal stuff i saw a bill board for the law tigers after the initial meeting with one of their representatives i immediately felt a wave a relief that i was going to get the help i needed i was directed to nancy t she helped me step by step and answered any questions i had at any time via email or phone call she was completely amazing and handled the entire case without me needed to do anything besides fax her bills that kept pouring in from the accident my main concern was getting as much of the bills cover as possible and guess what i did not have to pay a dime as we are approaching the end of my case she gave me all the great news and my wife and i are so pleased with nancy and everything she has done for us my wife cried and to be honest i almost did to knowing that we can finally put all this behind us thank you nancy even tho we have never met face to face i love you for helping me through this my mind is now at peace that all these bills will now dissappear and i can move on to everyone leaving negative comments these things take time and you must be patient they will try to help you the best they can but somethings are out of their hands you cant expect them to make money appear from thin air not everyone insurance policys are the same some people have more or less coverage then others and that can determine how much an insurance company can pay outpacific trial lawyerscarlos b ratedhave you ever said to yourself “wow i need that guy for my lawyer” that’s the kind of lawyer attorney ray ryan jr is i found him on a lawyer review service avvocom i had to fire my first lawyer for messing up my personal injury case several past clients gave ray great reviews and his rating was near perfect we spoke about my case during the evening hours which were convenient for me ray was clear and supportive he explained my rights and options in language that was clear to me however what genuinely impressed me was his willingness to handle my case according to traditional methods i made the choices he told me my options explained how each choice would influence my case and he executed my choice he never made any assumptions or choices for me sometimes we disagreed but he was always took the time to help me understand how my choices would affect my case most of the time we compromised he was very very aggressive with the other side when they missed a deadline to submit an item for review they lost their rights to submit it everything turned out super great in fact i had to sign a confidentiality agreement not to talk about the terms of settlement make it easy on yourself hire this guy if you need a lawyer there is a strong chance you will be very happy with your outcome and you will learn a lot about what a great lawyer should belaw offices of mark deniz aplcjacob m ratedso my girlfriend and i moved to california from ohio a few months ago we are in our early s and have no family or fallback within  miles one night we had gotten into a little arguement in the case where my girlfriend hit me in the head and the cops were called she was arrested and facing a felony even though i had only intended to scare her with the police they moved forward with chargeslong story short we thought our adventure was over we figured we would owe so much in lawyer fees courth fees bail bonds and more that we would simply lose our place and have to go back to ohio it was a dark time for us i had googled for a lawyer in my area the next day it was saturday evening and the first  didnt answer luckily mark was only  rings away i explained the situation and we met the next daywithin a week everything was dropped no court no anything just vanished we hoped maybe he could get the charge dropped to a lesser charge but did not expect to walk scott freemy girlfriend nearly cried as he gave us the good news right before we were going to walk into courtone other thing we are most pleased about is how cool he was with the lawyer fees he worked on a payment plan that fit us and let me tell you lawyers can be expensive he had every right to charge double for the magic he pulled  starsgive him a try if you want a little peace of mindlaw offices of shana j blackambrose ratedshana is an intelligent attorney who cares about the needs of families and is fair and extremely knowledgeable on family law during her representation of my case shana was realistic about my case she was confident and considerate about what my expectations where regarding custody of my daughter the real success came after shana won my case and the relationship between my daughter  her father was restored despite my fears that he would treat her differently because of the results in fact it strengthened because of the clear boundaries that were put in place during the hearing and the transparency after it was over our family has truly healed with better communication between both parents and a common goal to raise our daughter in a loving environment since then when i have a family law concern that may arise she is quick to respond whether by text or email due to the distance i retained another attorney through my employer thinking of saving money and i quickly learned what a huge mistake that was despite the disastrous outcome and poor service from the socalled big family law firm in my new residential area shana still was able to offer her professional opinion her superior family law counsel helped us accomplish our goals at our last hearing and the success from that case was astoundinglaw offices of leslie shaw a pcjoseph p ratedthank you leslie shaw and staffi hurt my neck and back at work my employer wouldnt send me to see a doctor a few weeks later they laid me off i met with leslie and she sentme to see dr jerome hall one of san diegos best orthopedic specialists and spinal surgeons she also told me that i was eligible for temporary total disability payments from the insurance company two weeks later a check arrived and theyve continued every two weeks now two years later ive had spinal surgery on my neck and lower back its been a long two years the insurance company had denied about  percent of the treatments my doctor had requested leslie appealed those denials and they were all overturned whenever ive had questions i would send her an email and i would get an answer within a few hours she also keeps me updated through the mail i get copies of all documents pertaining to my case i also see her in person at her office to discuss where were at and where were going i have referred others to her and will continue to do so without her lawyer skills and hard work i might have become a cripple and probably would have become homeless to date i havent paid her a penny in the end i dont think the fee shell receive will be enough for all the great work shes done for me thank you leslie shaw and stafffeuerstein  murphy

care of me to set things right again in my life from the very first phone call to the law tigers to the final settlement check michelle hall made me feel comfortable understanding of what to expect and felt like i wasn’t just a number but a person with a family life and most importantly that i mattered to them i wish i never was hit by a driver but if you’re looking for a place to take care of

really took care of my needs now months later i am back on the road riding my new bike and just glad to know law tigers took care of my situation thanks again to michelle hall you’re such a kind soul

experience questions one of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorneys history when you first step into a lawyers office you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas you have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practices success look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of courtonce you inquire about the broad details of their legal career you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue you should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs lawyers cant mention clients by name but you should ask for basic details about identical past casesfinancial questions you need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney you should request a list of all costs in advance so you wont be surprised by additional expenses like overhead also determine exactly when you will start being billed you want to inspect paperwork carefully if the attorney charges you for his or her experience you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistantfind out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour many civil lawyers work on contingency whatever the payment plan make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performancelawyerclient relationship
