treasure quest program reveals behindthescenes look at the discovery and exploration of the deepocean shipwreck site tampa fl – february    odyssey marine exploration inc nasdaqcm omex pioneers in the field of deepocean shipwreck exploration has discovered the longsought shipwreck of hms victory lost in  solving one of the greatest mysteries in naval history the direct predecessor and inspiration behind nelson’s flagship balchin’s victory was the mightiest and technically most advanced vessel of her age she sank during a storm in  with all hands and was the last royal navy warship to be lost at sea with a complete complement of bronze cannon two of the greatest admirals in english history sir john norris and sir john balchin called her their flagship research indicates that balchin’s victory sank with a substantial amount of gold and silver specie aboard odyssey has been cooperating closely with the united kingdom’s ministry of defence mod on the project and all activities at the site have been conducted in accordance with protocols agreed with mod and royal navy officials terms of collaboration between odyssey and the uk mod on the project are currently being negotiated and an agreement similar to the sussex partnering agreement has been proposed “finding this shipwreck has solved one of the greatest shipwreck mysteries in history having discovered it in deep water far from where history says it was lost has served to exonerate admiral balchin and his officers from the accusation of having let the ship run aground on the casquets due to faulty navigation” commented greg stemm odyssey’s chief executive officer “we have worked closely with the mod on this operation and anticipate that we will continue the excellent cooperative relationship that we have enjoyed working together on the sussex project fortunately this shipwreck is not in waters claimed by any other country so we do not expect any interference in further exploration of the site” odyssey discovered the site nearly  km from where the ship was historically believed to have been wrecked on a reef near the channel islands in an operation conducted in cooperation with the mod odyssey has completed an archaeological predisturbance survey of the site conducted limited test trenching and recovered two bronze cannon to confirm the identity of the shipwreck the cannon recovered include a pounder featuring the royal arms of george ii and a  ton pounder bearing the crest of george i the huge pounder recovered is the only known example of a gun of this type and size currently in existence on dry land the only other artifacts recovered to date were two small brick fragments that were brought into us federal court in order to file an admiralty arrest of the site during these operations evidence was discovered of substantial damage to the site from natural deterioration scouring extensive fishing trawl net damage and the intrusion of modern trash and debris “rather than staying frozen in time beneath the waves this unique shipwreck is fading fast” warns marine archaeologist dr sean kingsley director of wreck watch international “the victory lies in an area of intensive trawling and her hull and contents are being ploughed away by these bulldozers of the deep day in day out leaving the victory’s rich archaeology so vulnerable to the ravages of man is like allowing a motorway to smash straight through a historic site on land without excavating it the archaeological recovery of the artifacts from the site should begin as soon as possible or the story of england’s most important lost manofwar may not survive to be told” sir robert balchin descendant of admiral sir john balchin stated “this is the most astonishing news for generations my family has wondered about the fate of sir john and the victory now that the wreck has been found i and my family hope that as many of the artifacts on it as possible will be raised to the surface our fear is that erosion or trawler fishing will destroy what is there within a very few years it would be wonderful to see these historic artifacts on permanent display in a museum where they will give a unique insight into naval warfare in the mid th century” a preliminary archaeological report detailing research and work to date on the site which identifies the shipwreck as that of hms victory is available
