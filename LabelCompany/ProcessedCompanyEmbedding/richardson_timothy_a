what they say but just as certainly with an eye toward how they present whatever they seem to saythis means that though this is not a course in film studies or history but “writing about film” we will pay a great deal of attention to the language and elements of films those that are common with literature for instance and those that are specific to the genrebeyond the work we do in class grades

designed to introduce students to the world of contemporary creative writing particularly to the  genres of literary prose fiction creative nonfiction essay writing and poetry  this will be accomplished through discussions readings writing assignments both inclass writing prompts and group exercises as well as takehome typed writing assignments and workshops  all students will compose original works of creative nonfiction prose fiction and poetry culminating in three final polished portfolios one poetry portfolio of at least  poems one fiction portfolio containing a final polished short story of  pages and one creative nonfiction portfolio containing a final polished creative nonfiction essay of   pages we will practice the art of writing poetry creative nonfiction and fiction critically as well as creatively  we will not hold one person’s work against another’s—there is no corner on good and there is enough excellence to go around—but against the light of the finest that has been—is being—written and we will encourage one another to reach beyond our current grasps remembering that we are here not in the service of ego but of art  we will also read and discuss some of the best contemporary poetry nonfiction essays and short stories to see what we can steal  by “steal” i don’t mean plagiarize more on this as the term progresses unlike literature courses where the discussions focus mainly on subject and theme we will discuss these works in terms of craft  we will be architects of language and will learn the best ways to deliver meaning to an audience  specifically we will concentrate on the three “s’s” of good writing style structure and specifics most importantly we will learn that writing is work but an enjoyable and quite rewarding form of work

to the earliest traditions of rhetoric but as we follow the grand recit of rhetoric from the sophists to augustine  in some sense a journey from display to interpretation  we will consider what these texts allege regarding the definition and limits of rhetoric and its relationship towith other ancient and contemporary critical systems what are the differences if any between rhetoric and other systems that claim a body of knowledge philosophy religion politics can the differences if any be expressed in terms of suppositions about what words should can do in particular we will be looking at some examples of late antique rabbinic exegesis with an eye or ear toward discovering how the tradition may fit with the study of classical rhetorics spring  regular academic session   download
