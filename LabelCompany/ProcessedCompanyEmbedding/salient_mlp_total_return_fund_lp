partners lp salient a  billion asset management firm has launched the salient mlp fund class a ticker samcx class c ticker scmcx class i ticker simcx this is the firms second mutual fund focused on master limited partnerships mlps the salient mlp fund the fund seeks to provide a high level of total return and emphasizes making quarterly cash distributions to shareholders its strategy entails investing at least  percent of its net assets in equity securities of mlps the fund may also invest in securities of other energy companies and securities issued by open and closedend investment companies including money market funds actively managed and index exchange traded funds and exchange traded notes us government securities debt securities cash andor other cash equivalents   we believe economic uncertainty and a low interest rate environment have caused an increased interest in yieldoriented securities said gregory a reid partner and managing director of salient who serves as the president and ceo of salients master limited partnership business many investors seeking attractive yields potential inflation protection and distribution growth are turning to mlps which have demonstrated a compelling historical performance since  focused on the midstream energy industry with longterm feebased real assets that engage in the transportation and storage of natural resources the salient mlp fund utilizes a ccorp structure the advisor intends to strategically utilize leverage to minimize the effects of deferred tax liability accruing on any unrealized gains realized gains and net income leverage will be approximately  percent of the value of the funds total assets the fund is nondiversified which means that it may invest in a limited number of issuers and its investment may be in issuers of any market capitalization ranges portfolio allocation will be focused in midstream mlps that principally own and operate assets used in energy logistics the funds investment process puts emphasis on seeking cash flow stability balance sheet strength and management experience said mr reid daily liquidity quarterly distributions and  tax reporting are additional attributes of the funds investorfriendly structure to learn more about the salient mlp fund please visit wwwsalientfundscom for more information about salient please contact chris moon of jcpr at  or cmoonjcprinccom the funds investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by mlps which may increase price fluctuation the value of commoditylinked investments such as the mlps and other energy companies in which the fund invests are subject to risks specific to the industry they serve such as fluctuations in commodity prices reduced volumes of available natural gas or other energy commodities slowdowns in new construction and acquisitions a sustained reduced demand for crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities changes in the macroeconomic or regulatory environment environmental hazards rising interest rates and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets each of which could affect the funds profitability mlps are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership if an mlp were to be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate the amount of cash available for distribution would be reduced and such distributions received by the fund would be taxed under federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends received as dividend income return of capital or capital gain in addition investing in mlps involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock including risks related to cash flow dilution and voting rights such companies may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in mlp funds the fund is subject to certain mlp tax risks and risks associated with accounting for its deferred tax liability which could materially reduce the net asset value an investment in the fund does not offer the tax benefits of a direct investment in an mlp the fund unlike most openend funds is classified for federal tax purposes as a domestic taxable corporation or socalled subchapter c corporation as a c corporation the fund will incur tax expenses this treatment is still a relatively recent strategy for openend funds and it involves complicated accounting tax and valuation aspects that may cause the fund to differ significantly from most other openend registered investment companies this could result in unexpected and potentially significant accounting tax and valuation consequences for the fund and for its shareholders in addition accounting tax and valuation practices in this area are still developing and there may not always be a clear consensus among industry participants as to the most appropriate approach this could result in changes over time in the practices applied by the fund which in turn could have significant adverse consequences on the fund and its shareholders no fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund the fund may engage in other investment practices

assets all classes m overview overview the fund is designed as a core investment for those who worry about losing money in equity market downturns but also want to participate in the market’s upside the nimble strategy seeks to sidestep downturns while aiming for positive returns through market cycles using active market exposure management the fund moves in and out of the market incrementally based upon macro and technical factors three things to know the investment team uses proprietary models to judge the direction of the market and is able to change exposure immediately as market conditions change the fund is able to be up to  long when models are positive and go up to  short if models turn negative while also being able to hold up to  cash with a very low standard deviation the strategy seeks to add value by helping to lower the impact of volatility and to preserve capital during down markets process objective the fund seeks to produce in any market environment aboveaverage riskadjusted returns and less downside volatility than the sp  index the investment process begins with an assessment of the fundamental economic environment through valuation monetary policy and investor sentiment the team then validates these qualitative factors with a quantitative assessment using a proprietary multifactor volumebreadth momentum model after evaluating these models the team adjusts the fund’s market exposure accordingly increasing equity exposure when the risks are low decreasing equity exposure when the risks are high or taking a neutral position when no

about the fund for mutual funds a prospectus is available by calling  on this website or from your financial professional for other salient funds you should contact your financial professional the prospectus should be read carefully before investing salient fund specific risks salient tactical plus fund principal investment risks an investment in the fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” or any other government agency the fund’s principal risk factors are listed below the fund’s shares will go up and down in price meaning that you could lose money by investing in the fund many factors influence a mutual fund’s performance an investment in the fund is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such before investing be sure to read the additional descriptions of these risks beginning on page  of the prospectus as an overall matter instability in the financial markets has led many governments including the united states government to take a number of unprecedented actions designed to support certain financial institutions and segments of the financial markets that have experienced extreme volatility and in some cases a lack of liquidity federal state and other governments and their regulatory agencies or selfregulatory organizations may take actions that affect the regulation of the instruments in which the fund invests or the issuers of such instruments in ways that are unforeseeable legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the fund itself is regulated such legislation or regulation could limit or preclude the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective risks of investment activities generally all securities investing and trading activities risk the loss of capital no assurance can be given that the fund’s investment activities will be successful or that the fund’s shareholders will not suffer losses cash and cash equivalents risk it is part of the fund’s investment strategy to at times hold a substantial portion of its assets in cash andor cash equivalents including money market instruments under certain market conditions such as during a rising stock market this strategy could have a negative effect on the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objective to the extent that the fund invests in a money market fund the fund will indirectly bear a proportionate share of the money market fund’s expenses in addition to the operating expenses of the fund which are borne directly by fund shareholders debt securities fixedincome securities generally are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments andor repay the principal on its debt interest rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixedincome security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates when the general level of interest rates goes up the prices of most fixedincome securities go down when the general level of interest rates goes down the prices of most fixedincome securities go up credit risk credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer of the security will not be able to make principal and interest payments when due changes in an issuer’s credit rating or the market’s perception of an issuer’s creditworthiness may also affect the value of the fund’s investment in that issuer the degree of credit risk depends on both the financial condition of the issuer and the terms of the obligation securities rated by the rating agencies in the four highest categories standard  poor’s “sp” aaa aa a and bbb fitch ratings “fitch” aaa aa a and bbb or moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aaa aa a and baa are considered investment grade but they may also have some speculative characteristics meaning that they carry more risk than higher rated securities and may have problems making principal and interest payments in difficult economic climates investment grade ratings do not guarantee that bonds will not lose value extension risk extension risk is the risk that when interest rates rise certain obligations will be paid off by the issuer or obligor more slowly than anticipated causing the value of these securities to fall rising interest rates tend to extend the duration of securities making them more sensitive to changes in interest rates the value of longerterm securities generally changes more in response to changes in interest rates than shorterterm securities as a result in a period of rising interest rates securities may exhibit additional volatility and may lose value interest rate risk the yields for certain securities are susceptible in the shortterm to fluctuations in interest rates and the prices of such equity securities may decline when interest rates rise interest rate risk in general is the risk that prices of fixed income securities generally increase when interest rates decline and decrease when interest rates increase the fund may decline in value or suffer losses if short term or long term interest rates rise sharply or otherwise change in a manner not anticipated by the subadvisor prepayment risk prepayment risk is the risk that certain debt securities with high interest rates will be prepaid by the issuer before they mature when interest rates fall certain obligations will be paid off by the obligor more quickly than originally anticipated and an investor may have to invest the proceeds in securities with lower yields in periods of falling interest rates the rate of prepayments tends to increase as does price fluctuation as borrowers are motivated to pay off debt and refinance at new lower rates during such periods reinvestment of the prepayment proceeds by the management team will generally be at lower rates of return than the return on the assets that were prepaid prepayment reduces the yield to maturity and the average life of the security derivatives risk the use of derivative instruments exposes the fund to additional risks and transaction costs these instruments come in many varieties and have a wide range of potential risks and rewards and may include futures contracts options on futures contracts options both written and purchased swaps and swaptions a risk of the fund’s use of derivatives is that the fluctuations in their values may not correlate perfectly with the overall securities markets emerging market risk the fund may have exposure to emerging markets emerging markets are riskier than more developed markets because they tend to develop unevenly and may never fully develop investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative emerging markets are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations which adversely affect returns to us investors in addition many emerging securities markets have far lower trading volumes and less liquidity than developed markets equity securities risk equity securities may be subject to general movements in the stock market and a significant drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the fund has exposure the fund may have exposure to or invest in equity securities of companies with small or medium capitalization investments in securities of companies with small or medium capitalization involve certain risks that may differ from or be greater than those for larger companies such as higher volatility lower trading volume lack of liquidity fewer business lines and lack of public information see “small and midcapitalization securities risk” exchange traded fund “etf” risk because the fund invests in etfs and in options on etfs the fund is exposed to the risks associated with the securities and other investments held by such etfs the value of any investment in an etf will fluctuate according to the performance of that etf in addition the fund will indirectly bear a proportionate share of expenses including any management fees paid by each etf in which the fund invests such expenses are in addition to the operating expenses of the fund which are borne directly by shareholders of the fund further individual shares of an etf may be purchased and sold only on a national securities exchange through a brokerdealer the price of such shares is based on market price and because etf shares trade at market prices rather than nav shares may trade at a price greater than nav a premium or less than nav a discount the market price of an etf’s shares like the price of any exchangetraded security includes a “bidask spread” charged by the exchange specialists market makers or other participants that trade the particular security the bidask spread often increases significantly during times of market disruption which means that to the extent that the fund invests directly in an etf the shares of that etf may trade at a greater discount at a time when the fund wishes to sell its shares many etfs have obtained exemptive relief from the securities and exchange commission the “sec” permitting unaffiliated funds to invest in shares of the etf beyond the limitations imposed by the investment company act of  the “ act” subject to certain conditions the fund may rely on these exemptive orders to invest in unaffiliated etfs and the risks described above may be greater than if the fund limited its investment in an etf in accordance with the limitations imposed by the  act foreign securities risk foreign investments often involve special risks not present in us investments that can increase the chances that the fund will lose money these risks include the fund generally holds its foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of the fund’s portfolio the economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the united states with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product reinvestment of capital resources and balance of payments position the governments of certain countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries many foreign governments do not supervise and regulate stock exchanges brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the united states and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to us securities laws settlement and clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of us investments hedging risk although hedging activities are generally engaged in to help offset negative movements with respect to an investment such activities will not always be successful moreover hedging may cause the fund to lose money and may reduce the opportunity for gain high portfolio turnover risk to the extent that the fund makes investments on a shorterterm basis the fund may as a result trade more frequently and incur higher levels of brokerage fees and commissions leverage risk the fund may make investments in options swaps and futures contracts or other derivative instruments these and certain other derivatives provide the economic effect of financial leverage by creating additional investment exposure as well as the potential for greater loss in connection with derivatives investments the fund will be required to maintain specified asset coverage with respect to such investments by both the  act and the terms of these investments the fund may be required to dispose of portfolio investments on unfavorable terms if market fluctuations or other factors reduce the required asset coverage below necessary amounts market events the us government and the federal reserve as well as certain foreign governments and their central banks have taken various steps designed to support and stabilize credit and financial markets since  reduction or withdrawal of this support failure of efforts to stabilize the markets or investor perception that such efforts are not succeeding could negatively affect financial markets generally as well as have an adverse impact on the liquidity and value of certain securities in addition policy and legislative changes in the united states and in other countries are affecting many aspects of financial regulation for example the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was enacted in the us reflecting a significant revision of the us financial regulatory framework the doddfrank act addresses a variety of topics including among others new rules for trading in derivatives restrictions on banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading of certain instruments the registration and additional regulation of private fund managers and new federal requirements for residential mortgage loans securities in which the fund invests or the issuers of such securities may be impacted by the doddfrank act and any related or additional legislation or regulation in unforeseeable ways the ultimate effect of the doddfrank act and any related or additional regulation is not yet known the impact of these changes on the markets and the practical implications for market participants may not be fully known for some time market risk market risk is the risk that the markets on which the fund’s investments trade will increase or decrease in value prices may fluctuate widely over short or extended periods in response to company market or economic news markets also tend to move in cycles with periods of rising and falling prices if there is a general decline in the securities and other markets your investment in the fund may lose value regardless of the individual results of the securities and other instruments in which the fund invests new fund risk the fund is newlyformed accordingly investors in the fund bear the risk that the fund may not be successful in implementing its investment strategy and may not employ a successful investment strategy any of which could result in the fund being liquidated at any time without shareholder approval and at a time that may not be favorable for all shareholders such a liquidation could have negative tax consequences for shareholders short sale risk the fund may take a short position in a derivative instrument such as a future forward or swap a short position on a derivative instrument involves the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the value of the underlying instrument the fund may also from time to time sell securities short which involves borrowing and selling a security and covering such borrowed security through a later purchase a short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit thus increasing the cost of buying those securities to cover the short position there can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase the fund must set aside “cover” for short sales to comply with applicable sec positions under the investment company act of  as amended “ act” small and midcapitalization securities risk the fund may invest its assets in the common stocks and other equity securities of small and midcapitalization companies with smaller market capitalizations while the subadvisor believes these investments may provide significant potential for appreciation they involve higher risks in some respects than do investments in common stocks and other equity securities of larger companies for example prices of such investments are often more volatile than prices of largecapitalization stocks and other equity securities in addition due to thin trading in some such investments an investment in these common stocks and other equity securities may be more illiquid than that of common stocks or other equity securities of larger market capitalization issuers smaller capitalization companies also fail more often than larger companies and may have more limited management and financial resources than larger companies volatility and creditworthiness risk the downgrade of the us government’s credit rating in  may adversely affect fund performance in  sp downgraded the us government’s credit rating from aaa to aa and this unprecedented downgrade could lead to subsequent downgrades by sp or downgrades by other credit rating agencies these developments and the government’s credit concerns in general could cause an increase in interest rates and borrowing costs which may negatively impact both the perception of credit risk associated with the debt securities issued by the us and the country’s ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms in addition a lowered credit rating could create broader financial turmoil and uncertainty which may negatively affect the value of fund shares or the fund’s performance definition of terms the sp  index is a widely recognized unmanaged index of  of the largest companies in the united states as measured by market capitalization the sp  index assumes reinvestment of all dividends and distributions because indices cannot be invested in directly the

international holdings are subject to currency fluctuation risk differences in accounting principles and country specific risks given the energy sector focus of many mlps a sustained decline in the demand for energy products could adversely affect mlp revenues and cash flows no operating or trading history the fund is a newlyorganized nondiversified closedend management investment company and has no operating or public trading history being a newlyorganized company the fund is subject to all of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business including the risk that the fund will not achieve its investment objective and that the value of an investment could decline substantially investment and market risk an investment in the fund’s common shares is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest an investment in the fund’s common shares is not intended to constitute a complete investment program and should not be viewed as such the value of the securities in which the fund invests like other market investments may move up or down sometimes rapidly and unpredictably your investment in the fund’s common shares at any point in time may be worth less than your original investment even after taking into account the reinvestment of distributions risks relating to mlps in investments an investment in mlp units involves risks that differ from a similar investment in equity securities such as common stock of a corporation holders of mlp units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common stockholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units additionally conflicts of interest may exist among common unit holders subordinated unit holders and the general partner or managing member of an mlp midstream sector risk certain risks inherent in investing in midstream companies and mlps include changes in the supply and demand for natural resources depletion of reserves changes in governmental regulations changes in commodity prices inability to consummate acquisitions or realize the benefits therefrom dependency on affiliates the occurrence of significant natural or manmade catastrophes terrorist activities government instability and the occurrence of extreme weather conditions derivates risk the fund may purchase and sell derivative investments such as exchangelisted and overthecounter put and call options on securities equity fixed income interest rate and currency indices and other financial instruments and enter into various interest rate transactions such as swaps or credit default swaps the fund also may purchase derivative investments that combine features of these instruments the use of derivatives has risks including high price volatility government intervention nonperformance by the counterparty and the imperfect correlation between the value of such instruments and the underlying assets the possible default of the other party to the transaction or illiquidity of the derivative investments furthermore the ability to successfully use these techniques depends on salient capital advisors llc’s ability to predict pertinent market movements which cannot be assured the use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that the fund might otherwise sell in addition amounts paid by the fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to derivative transactions are not otherwise available to the fund for investment purposes options risk the fund currently expects to write covered call options on portfolio positions in an amount up to  of the value of total assets in its portfolio with the purpose of generating realized gains the fund also intends to write uncovered call options in an amount up to  of the value of total assets in its portfolio and purchase put options as part of its hedging strategy as the writer of a covered call option during the option’s life the fund gives up the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike price of the call but the fund retains the risk of loss should the price of the underlying security decline the seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited loss as a result of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option the buyer of a put or call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium invested in the option short sales risk a short sale creates the risk of an unlimited loss in that the price of the underlying security could theoretically increase without limit thus increasing the cost of buying the securities that were sold short to cover the short position there can be no assurance that the securities necessary to cover a short position will be available for purchase the fund intends to limit its use of short sales to  of the value of total assets in the portfolio use of leverage under normal market conditions the fund intends to leverage instruments in an amount that represents approximately  of its total assets which represents approximately  of net assets including proceeds from such leverage instruments however as market conditions develop the fund may use leverage instruments in amounts that represent greater than  leverage to the extent permitted by the investment company act of  as amended the “ act” any subsidiary c corporations used by the fund will comply with the  act restrictions on borrowing and will be included in the fund’s leverage calculations leverage instruments will have seniority over the common shares and may be secured by the assets of the fund the fund currently anticipates leveraging its assets through borrowings from banks and other financial institutions the fund currently anticipates that it will enter into at least one credit facility in an amount up to   of total assets although the use of leverage by the fund may create an opportunity for increased return for common shareholders it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses there is no assurance that the fund’s use of leverage will be successful delay in use of proceeds although the fund currently intends to invest the proceeds from the sale of the common shares within three months after the closing of this offering such investments may be delayed if suitable investments are unavailable at the time the trading market and volumes for the midstream companies and mlps in which the fund intends to invest may at times be less liquid than the market for other securities cash flow risk a substantial portion of the cash flow received by the fund is derived from its investment in equity securities of midstream companies and mlps the amount of cash that any such company has available to pay its equity holders in the form of distributionsdividends depends on the amount of cash flow generated from such company’s operations interest rate risk the yields for equity securities of mlps and certain midstream mlps and midstream companies are susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates and the prices of such equity securities may decline when interest rates rise rising interest rates could adversely impact the financial performance of energy companies by increasing their cost of capital interest rates are at or near historic lows and as a result they are likely to rise over time capital markets risk global financial markets and economic conditions have been and continue to be volatile due to a variety of factors as a result the cost of raising capital in the debt and equity capital markets has increased while the ability to raise capital from those markets has diminished if funding is not available when needed or is available only on unfavorable terms midstream companies and mlps may not be able to meet their obligations as they come due moreover without adequate funding midstream companies and mlps may be unable to execute their growth strategies complete future acquisitions take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on their revenues and results of operations equity securities risk equity securities are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the price of securities to which the fund has exposure debt securities risk debt securities in which the fund invests are subject to many of the risks described elsewhere in this section in addition they are subject to credit risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and depending on their quality other special risks risks associated with an investment in initial public offerings “ipos’ securities purchased in ipos are often subject to the general risks associated with investments in companies with small market capitalizations and typically to a heightened degree securities issued in ipos have no trading history and information about the companies may be available for very limited periods in addition the prices of securities sold in an ipo may be highly volatile privately held company risk privately held companies are not subject to sec reporting requirements are not required to maintain their accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and are not required to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting as a result salient capital advisors llc may not have timely or accurate information about the business financial condition and results of operations of the privately held companies in which the fund invests in addition the securities of privately held companies are generally illiquid and entail the risks described under—“liquidity risk” below liquidity risk securities with limited trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements therefore it may be more difficult for the fund to buy and sell significant amounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices interest rate hedging risk interest rate transactions that the fund may use for hedging purposes will expose the fund to certain risks that differ from the risks associated with its portfolio holdings the fund’s success in using hedging instruments is subject to salient capital advisors llc’s ability to predict correctly changes in the relationships of such hedging instruments to its interest rate risk and there can be no assurance that salient capital advisors llc’s judgment in this respect will be accurate concentration risk the focus of the fund’s portfolio on companies within the midstream sector may present more risks than if its portfolio were broadly diversified over numerous sectors of the economy inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investment will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline portfolio turnover risk the fund anticipates that its annual portfolio turnover rate will range between  and  excluding the turnover from its hedging program but the rate may vary greatly from year to year a higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the fund management risk dependence on key personnel of salient capital advisors llc the fund’s portfolio is subject to management risk because it is actively managed salient capital advisors llc applies investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for us but there can be no guarantee that they will produce the desired results the fund depends upon salient capital advisors llc’s key personnel for its future success and upon their access to certain individuals and investments in the midstream sector the departure of any of salient capital advisors llc’s portfolio managers or the senior management of salient capital advisors llc could have a material adverse effect on salient capital advisors llc’s ability to achieve the fund’s investment objective in addition the fund can offer no assurance that salient capital advisors llc will remain its investment adviser or that the fund will continue to have access to salient capital advisors llc’s industry contacts and deal flow conflicts of interest of salient capital advisors llc conflicts of interest may arise because salient capital advisors llc and its affiliates generally carry on substantial investment activities for other clients in which the fund will have no interest salient capital advisors llc or its affiliates may have financial incentives to favor certain of such accounts over the fund any of their proprietary accounts and other customer accounts may compete with the fund for specific trades risk of owning securities of affiliates from time to time the fund may “control” or may be an “affiliate” of one or more of its portfolio companies which depending on securities and exchange commission interpretations may result in restrictions being imposed on the size of positions that may be taken for the fund or on the type of investments that the fund could make competition risk there are a limited number of other companies including other publicly traded investment companies and private funds which may serve as alternatives to the fund for investment in a portfolio of companies in the midstream sector valuation risk market prices may not be readily available for any restricted or unregistered investments in public companies or investments in private companies made by the fund due to the difficulty in valuing these securities and the absence of an active trading market for these investments the fund may not be able to realize these securities’ carrying value or may have to delay their sale in order to do so restricted securities the fund may invest in unregistered or otherwise restricted securities restricted securities may be more difficult to value and the fund may have difficulty disposing of such assets either in a timely manner or for a reasonable price nondiversified status overall risk can be reduced by investing in securities from a diversified pool of issuers while overall risk is increased by investing in securities of a small number of issuers credit market and other risks associated with its investment strategies or techniques may be more pronounced for the fund than for a fund that is more “diversified” antitakeover provisions provisions of the declaration of trust and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of the fund’s common shareholders as a result these provisions may deprive the fund’s common shareholders of opportunities to sell common shares at a premium over the then current market price of common shares market discount risk shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at prices lower than their net asset value which is commonly referred to as “trading at a discount” the risk of loss due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the offering an investment in the fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not designed to be
