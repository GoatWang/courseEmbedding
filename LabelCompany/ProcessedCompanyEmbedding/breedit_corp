the oldest and youngest industries in the world on one hand cannabis has been used for centuries as a medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments on the other hand the drug has only recently been legalized by uruguay and some parts of the united states the result is an immensely popular industry with very little infrastructure and regulationthe legalization of cannabis has created an overnight spike in demand for infrastructure and regulatory solutions on the regulatory side strict requirements on cbdthc content for medical cannabis has created demand for effective breeding and testing solutions on the infrastructure side legalization has created an enormous opportunity for largescale cannabis cultivationbreedit corp brdt aims to capitalize on both of these trends with its ibreeditr an intelligent decision support software idss for breeders developed at the hebrew university of jerusalem by helping breeders quickly and effectively to plan manage and analyze breeding data the system reduces time to market eliminates costly errors enhances product quality and reduces costin the cannabis industry commercial growers must balance firstmover advantage with producing highquality cannabis for target end markets in addition to consistently producing the right mix results it is also important to minimize waste these dynamics are similar to those in the food industry where premiums for the right seeds are justified by a higher yield and greater product quality at harvestinnovative technologybreeders commonly spend millions of dollars and several years developing new plant varieties and hybrids often times the process involves tracking thousands of different plants across multiple locations despite the complexity many breeders use tools like microsoft excel and lack effective centralization of data basic planning tools intelligent decision support and rapid reporting that could make the process much more efficient and almost error freebreedits proprietary ibreeditr idss is designed to solve these problems by standardizing the collection of data making it easily accessible via the cloud and analyzing the data to extract key data points most importantly the software also eliminates possibilities and advises the breeder on the best path to take as a result breeders can avoid crucial mistakes and researchers are able to free up more time to work on important issues and waste less time on mundane tasks while collaboration across multiple locations is greatly simplifiedmany large companies including a leading breeder of daniela tomatoes are already using the software in the field breedit will license its software to breeders in exchange for a onetime sale and an ongoing service and support fee or pay per use agreements software as service which generates highmargin recurring income for shareholders over the longterm the business model could unlock significant valuetransition to a licensingthe institutionalization of the

and hardware provider to breeders the company has recently changed its name ticker and core business from progaming platforms corporation with the ticker pptf please note i use the ticker brdt ticker to refer to progaming platforms corporation in some parts of article in order to secure a flow in the article which was engaged in development of software to the gaming industry which never got completed or sold to a customer… i will analyze the history of the company its executives and business associates as well as the likely future scenario for the company in this article the old company the company was originally incorporated with the name progaming platforms corporations on may   in the state of delaware the company operated from israel the companys original core business was the development of an online gaming platform which it tried to distribute through distribution agents who first paid the company an upfront fee and afterwards a royalty on every sale it entered into distribution agreements with two distribution agents the luxembourgian gtsat international distribution to luxembourg belgium and holland  upfront fee and the israeli company yanir levin ltd distribution to israel  upfront fee gtsat international ended their agreement without selling any product it also seems like a rather odd partner since the company sells digital tv receivers the following is a screenshot from their website as far as i understand they never actually had any material revenue as set forth in the following screenshot from their recent k keep in mind that  of the revenue in fiscal  was from the upfront fee from the licensing agreement with gtsat international brdt furthermore entered into a joint venture agreement with zenetek llc which at the time of the jv was a wholly owned subsidiary of anything technologies medias otcpkexmt on february   the stated reason behind the jv was that zenetek llc should try to find jv opportunities that could generate revenue for brdts stateoftheart multiplayer puzzle game platform in china singapore taiwan vietnam hong kong and indonesia for the initial  months the jv with zenetek llc has ended its highly relevant to perform due diligence on the companys previous business affiliates and joint ventures in order to detect if any wrongdoing is in the blood of the company i will start with evaluating its former jv partner zenetek llc according to zenetek llcs webpage its a developer of marijuana apps for iphone android windows and mac the following is a screenshot from the companys webpage this seems rather strange as how should a marijuana app developer be able to distribute a mobile gaming development companys products in asia it gets even stranger as the parent company off zenetek llc was exmt during the tenure of the jv exmt operated in the multimedia industry excluding the gaming part of the multimedia industry exmt has since the end of the jv pursued a business opportunity in the medical marijuana space but with big losses ml capital group inc otcpkmlcg tried to acquire  of zenetek llc the parties have signed a letter of intent on september   but i havent found any evidence of the transaction having closed mlcg has since pursued another business opportunity by launching the superstar vapor pens the new company as the old game business didnt play out well for brdt it decided like its former business associates to pursue a new business opportunity in the medical marijuana space it announced an k filling describing a deal with another israel based company called breedit ltd on august   brdt should invest between  and  in breedit ltd for a  stake in the company the company in later fillings then decided to change its name and ticker from progaming platforms corporation with the ticker pptf to breedit corporation with the ticker brdt the following figure illustrates the current company structure dr oded sagee owns the remaining  of breedit ltd the board and management have changed since brdt bought a part breedit ltd the following changes have occured mr oded gilboa age  a licensed cpa in the united states and israel has been appointed cfo of the company he has a background in public finance and accounting with over  years of experience in these areas he has held several positions at big us listed companies before accepting the job at brdt mr yoel yogev has been appointed ceo of the company on january   he has a sales and support background in companies such as intel phillips and idt he later established elgev one of israels most successful electronic components and salesdistribution organizations mr itshack itrem has been appointed chairman of the board of directors he has served as managing director of yaad consulting  ltd which was organized in  and provides business development marketing and investment banking services to a wide variety of israeli companies the company agreed to invest between  and  although the company didnt have that in cash on hand as such the new management and board decided to dilute shareholders by issuing new equity at a low price to themselves and few new investors this increased the share count significantly the following table shows the unregistered sales of equity performed by the company as per its publicly available sec fillings as the table above shows the company has increased its diluted share count assuming that the company has paid back its convertible notes since the last q was filed to  diluted shares outstanding assuming that all warrants were converted note they are all in the money this is a considerably higher amount of shares outstanding than financial websites such as yahoo finance and google finance indicates which indicates shares outstanding of  million and  million respectively the companys authorized shares are  million so we might see management continue issuing stock to them in the future valuation as of the close of march   the company was trading with a market cap of  million this valuation is a bit high when taking into account that the company bought its core asset for  million a few months ago last time the company filed a q was on november   the balance sheet from the filling is as follows the balance sheet shows us that the companys cash and cash equivalents as of september   was  thousand dollars this number is excluding the issuance of equity and warrants the company has raised a total of  through issuing equity and warrants this gives us a total of  we then subtract the runrate deficit that the company is operating at which is  a quarter times two and the  million investment in breedit ltd resulting in an estimated cash balance of  the runrate deficit i have used in this calculation is fairly low compared to the companys recent hires so the cashbalance is likely lower so the company has cash of about  million and a  million investment in its subsidiary totaling its assets at approximately  million but is trading at a valuation of  million approximately  times assets this high valuation multiple presents a large downside if the company doesnt succeed with its business plan but lets now try to focus on the potential upside for the company potential upside first i have to admit that the management team of the company and its subsidiary has impressive backgrounds with a variety of skills that supplement each other which is a positive for the company second its important to thoroughly understand the product and business model of the company the company provides a socalled intelligent decision support system idss for breeders which is basically software and hardware that help breeders through their entire process from the lab to the field as the company hasnt filed any k filings since it changed its core business we dont have a detailed explanation of the business and business model in any sec filings we will have to use the companys website and management interviews instead the company has uploaded a marketing video to the front page of their website which describes its solution and shows pictures of the system according to the founder  ceo of bdrts subsidiary breedit ltd dr oded sagee the company are still in the process of translating its software from hebrew to multiple languages the company will be ready start market and sell its product around the world once this translation is done according to dr oded sagee he told us that in a recent interview link to the slides he uses in the interview hosted by fellow seeking alpha contributor and founder of the cannabis stock investment community  investor for those of you interested in cannabis investing alan provides unmatched and unbiased research and education on the cannabis industry through his community at  investor at a price every investor can afford dr oded sagee provided us with some very useful information during the interview which we can use to evaluate the business prospects of the company he told us that they are in talks with a us group about entering into a potential jv agreement they are furthermore in premature talks with a canadian company regarding the possibility of entering into a jv agreement he also stated that the company is in talks with the biggest medical cannabis grower in israel these talks have the potential of turning into great news for the company if it manages to convert talks to clever deals dr oded sagee furthermore provided us with sales projections the sales price per solution and the market size the sales price per solution is around  and the estimated size of the world market is  units according to dr oded sagee the following is his sales projection as we can see on the chart above the company expects to sell  units in year  which corresponds to  and  units by  this corresponds to a projected cumulative annual growth rate cagr of  which seems a bit too optimistic when taking the fact into account that the companys team is relatively small with only one guy responsible for sales however if the company manages to grow at that rate and charge k per unit with an estimated  net margin the companys net income will be approximately  millions by  which makes the stock look like a steal with a forward pe ratio of  however there is a big uncertainty inherent in this projection as the company is yet to build up an international sales and production organization investors should wait for the company to actually sell its products and see if the business model is sustainable before investing in other words wait for proof of business concept before investing conclusion we have seen a green rush so far in  with the marketfy  investor cannabis stock index rising by  in the first two months of the year for longterm success in investing investors have to compare the risk with the potential reward the risk relative to the reward seems too high in brdt as  the business model is unproven  the company is trading at multiple of  times assets  one of the first thing the new management did when they were hired was to issue stock at a low price to themselves which has diluted shareholders and  a realistic scenario with the companys current organization doesnt warrant such a high price it will be more prudent for investors to wait for the financials and wait for proof of business concept before investing disclosure i have no positions in
