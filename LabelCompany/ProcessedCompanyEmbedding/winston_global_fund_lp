beginning on march  the securities and exchange commission now requires all companies to report form d securities sales electronically form d is convenient in that it requires little detail most securities shares sold in the us must be registered but form d registration requires less disclosure than other stock sales sec regulation d was intended to facilitate access to capital markets funds for small companies that might otherwise have trouble finding capital the sellers are named but investors are not in a holdover from the bush administration a large corporation or a highly capitalized global network of investment firms can avail itself of form d on march  form d filings show that hedge funds connected to marvin p bushyoungest brother of former president george w bush former gop finance chairman in virginia and head of a northern virginia hedge fundraised over  billion by filing deadline more form d filings from march  show another  billion raised by bush companies companies directed by bush codirectors or spinoff companies the total is almost  billion raised by bushconnected hedge funds more than half of the money was raised offshore in large form d transactions for

courteous had trouble understanding my name replied to a question about securities by saying that the firm has made no such sales of assets and referred to form b d as in dog i clarified oh d as in dog saying that his position would make him knowledgeable about such transactions he disclaimed knowledge of the form d transactions in a followup email after being sent the sec filings mr power said these filings relate not to a securities sale from our portfolio but to us registering with the sec every time a sale in a new state has occurred or in other words every time we have received an investment from a particular us state for the first time i think the below filings were us playing catch up and registering all previous sales as we had not previously been keeping up to date with the filings power declined to answer questions about potential investments if powers guess is correct then perhaps the  billion in proceeds registered on march  and march  was bushrelated firms playing catch up and some people say change has not come spokespersons of other companies contacted have been unavailable or have not returned calls under sec regulations the form d notice must be filed within  days after the first sale of securities in the offering not counting weekends or holidays so the proceeds indicated on march  and march  could have been raised back to feb 2 or feb 2 in any case the network of relationships indicates that either the quiet transactions or the filings were coordinated or both these unregulated transactions seem to have a lot of vibrancy offshore evidently huge amounts of liquidity can be raised in the british virgin islands and the caymans even when we read every day about the skittishness of investors unwilling to wet their toes in american stock markets that skittishness is used to justify enormous taxpayer bailouts for us banks and other financial entities to induce them to invest in lending in the us housing education and transportation sectorsbut the brother of an expresident can still find a remarkable splash of investor energy even in tortola again the hedge fund transactions mentioned share an offshore dimension broadly the money trail is always the samefrom island base to shared personnel to shared company name back in dallas or atlanta or stamford conn or chatham nj the companies have not clarified what kind of investment they contemplate but realistic possibilities include shortselling by definition hedge funds aggressively play both the ups and the downs in the market by investing in stocks expected to rise and also shortselling stocks expected to go down theoretically they thus hedge their position against market downturnshence the name ironically former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan refused to regulate hedge funds or to monitor them stringently thinking that increased regulation would drive them offshore the edgar edgarestcom list of new filers for march  includes numerous hedge funds the march  and march  filings may indicate a preemptive effort to move offshore ahead of new proposals for regulatory reform such as those suggested by treasury secretary timothy geithner on march 2 proposals to regulate hedge funds are now being floated in congress high time federal oversight is overdue for the least monitored sector in financial markets where billions of dollars get floated for scantly defined and sometimes as it turns out unsecured shares in sales that also exploit an sec regulation intended to benefit small companies no productive purpose can be served by setting up a vertiginous array of separate company names filing separately with the secsometimes with shades of difference as small as different punctuation for the same company addressfor the sake of issuing and selling undefined shares these mechanisms exploited up to the highest levels of politics and finance look like a security breach as well as a drain on the us treasury margie
