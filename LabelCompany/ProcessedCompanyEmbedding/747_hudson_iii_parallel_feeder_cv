henry h hap arnold carl a spaatz and john h jouett as a counterbalance to the germanowned colombian carrier scadta operating in colombia since  scadta lobbied hard for landing rights in the panama canal zone ostensibly to survey air routes for a connection to the united states which the air corps viewed as a precursor to a possible german aerial threat to the canal arnold and spaatz drew up the prospectus for pan american when scadta hired a company in delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the us government pan american was able to obtain the us mail delivery contract to cuba but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in cuba on june   juan trippe formed the aviation corporation of the americas aca with the backing of powerful and politically connected financiers who included cornelius vanderbilt whitney and w averell harriman and raised  in startup capital from the sale of stock their operation had the allimportant landing rights for havana having acquired american international airways a small airline established in  by john k montgomery and richard b bevier as a seaplane service from key west florida to havana aca met its deadline of having an air mail service operating by october   by chartering a fairchild fc floatplane from a small dominican republic carrier west indian aerial express the atlantic gulf and caribbean airways company was established on october   by new york city investment banker richard hoyt who served as president this company merged with paa and aca on june   richard hoyt was named as president of the new aviation corporation of the americas but trippe and his partners held  of the equity and whitney was made president trippe became operational head of pan american airways the new companys principal operating subsidiary flown cover autographed by pilot cy caldwell and carried from key west fl to havana cuba on the first contract air mail flight operated by pan american airways oct   birthplace of pan american world airways key west florida the us government approved the original pan ams mail delivery contract with little objection out of fears that scadta would have no competition in bidding for routes between latin america and the united states the government further helped pan am by insulating it from its us competitors seeing the airline as the chosen instrument for usbased international air routes the airline expanded internationally benefiting from a virtual monopoly on foreign routes trippe and his associates planned to extend pan ams network through all of central and south america during the late s and early s pan am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in central and south america and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the governments airmail contracts to the region in september  trippe toured latin america with charles lindbergh to negotiate landing rights in a number of countries including barranquilla on scadtas home turf of colombia maracaibo and caracas by the end of the year pan am offered flights along the west coast of south america to peru the following year pan am purchased the new york rio and buenos aires line giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of south america to buenos aires argentina and westbound to santiago chile its brazilian subsidiary nyrba do brasil was later renamed as panair do brasil pan am also partnered with grace shipping company in  to form pan americangrace airways better known as panagra to gain a foothold to destinations in south america in the same year pan am acquired a controlling stake in mexicana de aviación and took over mexicanas ford trimotor route between brownsville texas and mexico city extending this service to the yucatan peninsula to connect with pan ams caribbean route network pan ams holding company the aviation corporation of the americas was one of the most sought after stocks on the new york curb exchange in  and flurries of speculation surrounded each of its new route awards in april  trippe and his associates reached an agreement with united aircraft and transport corporation uatc to segregate pan am operations to south of the mexico – united states border in exchange for uatc taking a large shareholder stake uatc was the parent company of what are now boeing pratt  whitney and united airlines the aviation corporation of the americas changed its name to pan american airways corporation in  flight crewsedit the sikorsky s was one of pan ams earlier flying boats and was used to survey the san francisco – china route critical to pan ams success as an airline was the proficiency of its flight crews who were rigorously trained in longdistance flight seaplane anchorage and berthing operations overwater navigation radio procedure aircraft repair and marine tides during the day use of the compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure at night all flight crews were trained to use celestial navigation in bad weather pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns making successful landings at foggedin harbors by landing out to sea then taxiing the plane into port many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates a pan am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic steadily gaining his licenses and working his way up the flight crew roster to navigator second officer and first officer before world war ii it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at remote locations pan ams mechanics and support staff were similarly trained newly hired applicants were frequently paired with experienced flight mechanics in several areas of the company until they had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties as might be expected in a small foreign port without an aviation infrastructure or even an adequate road network many crews supported repair operations by flying in spare parts to planes stranded overseas in some cases

primary international airline it encountered increasing competition — first from american export airlines american overseas airlines aoa from november  across the atlantic to europe and subsequently from others including twa to europe braniff to south america united to hawaii and northwest orient to east asia as well as five potential rivals to mexico this changed situation resulted from the new

douglas dcb operating an internal german service at hanover airport in may  from  until  pan am operated a comprehensive network of highfrequency shorthaul scheduled services between west germany and west berlin first with douglas dcs then with dcbs from  and boeing s from  this had come about as a result of an agreement between the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union at the end of world war ii which prohibited germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services from and to berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries rising cold war tensions between the soviet union and the three western powers resulted in unilateral soviet withdrawal from the quadripartite allied control commission in  culminating in the division of germany the following year these events together with soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the postwar agreement on the western powers access rights to berlin meant that until the end of the cold war air transport in west berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the remaining allied control commission powers with aircraft required to fly across hostile east german territory through three  mi  km wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of  ft  mnb  the airlines west berlin operation consistently accounted for more than half of the

widebodies by pan am and its competitors coincided with an economic slowdown reduced air travel after the  oil crisis made the overcapacity problem worse pan am was vulnerable with its high overheads and fixed costs as a result of a large decentralized infrastructure high fuel prices and its many older less fuelefficient narrowbodied airplanes increased the airlines operating costs federal route awards to other airlines such as the transpacific route case further reduced the number of passengers pan am carried and its profit margins a pan am flight attendant in s uniform on september   a group of pan am employees published an advertisement in the new york times to register their disagreement over federal policies which they felt were harming the financial viability of their employer the ad cited discrepancies in airport landing fees such as pan am paying  to land a plane in sydney while the australian carrier qantas paid only  to land a jet in los angeles the ad also contended that the united states postal service was paying foreign airlines five times as much to carry us mail in comparison to pan am finally the ad questioned why the exportimport bank of the united states

strategy trimming the network by  slashing the strong workforce by  and cutting wages introducing stringent economies and rescheduling debt and reducing the size of the fleet these measures aided by the use of taxloss credits enabled pan am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in  attempts to build a us domestic networkedit since the s juan trippe had coveted domestic routes for pan am through the late s and early s and in the mids there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as american airlines eastern air lines trans world airlines or united airlines as rival airlines convinced congress that pan am would use its political clout to monopolize us air routes the cab repeatedly denied the airline permission to operate in the us by growth or by a merger with another airline pan am remained an american carrier operating international routes only aside from hawaii and alaska the last time pan am was permitted to merge with another airline prior to the deregulation of the us airline industry was in  when it took over american overseas airlines from american airlines after deregulation in  more us domestic airlines began competing with pan am internationally national airlines takeoveredit to acquire domestic routes pan am under president seawell set its eyes on national airlines pan am wound up in a bidding war with frank lorenzos texas international that boosted nationals stock price but pan am was granted permission to buy national in  in what was described as the coup of the decade the acquisition of national airlines for  million further burdened pan ams balance sheet already under strain after financing the boeing s ordered in the mids this acquisition did little to improve pan ams competitive position in relation to nimbler lowercost competitors in a deregulated industry as nationals northsouth route structure provided insufficient feed at pan ams transatlantic and transpacific gateways in new york and los angeles the airlines had incompatible fleets apart from the boeing  and corporate cultures partly as a result of the former being perceived by some pan am employees as mainly a regional backwoods carrier with few trunk routes and the integration was poorly handled by pan am management who presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing nationals pay scales with pan ams

intercontinental hotels chain before this transaction closed seawell was replaced by c edward acker air floridas founder and expresident as well as a former braniff international executive the combined sale value of the intercontinental chain and the falcon jet corp stake was  million acker followed up the asset disposal program he had inherited from his predecessor with operational cutbacks most prominent among these was the discontinuation of the roundthe world service from october   when pan am ceased flying between delhi bangkok and hong kong due to the sectors unprofitability to provide additional seating capacity for its  springsummer season the airline also acquired three passenger boeing bs from flying tigers who took four pan ams – freighters in return fleet restructuringedit despite pan ams precarious financial situation in summer  acker went ahead with an order for new airbus models in wide body and narrowbodied aircraft becoming the second american company to order airbus aircraft after eastern air lines these advanced aircraft economically and operationally superior to the s and s pan am operated at the time were intended to make the

transatlantic network following etops certification approval by the federal aviation administration faa of transoceanic flying with twinengined aircraft pan ams decision not to take delivery of the as and to sell its delivery positions to braniff meant that the majority of its shorthaul us domestic and european feeder routes and most of its igs services continued to be flown with obsolete s until the airlines demise this put it at a disadvantage against rivals operating stateoftheart aircraft with greater passenger appeal in september  pan american world airways created a holding company called pan am corporation to assume ownership and control of the airline and the services division sale of pacific divisionedit given the airlines dire state in april  acker sold pan ams entire pacific division which consisted of  of its entire route system to united airlines for  million this sale also enabled pan am to address fleet incompatibility issues related to the earlier acquisition

address the issue of providing additional feed for pan ams mainline services at its hubs in new york los angeles and miami in the united states and berlin in germany the renamed pan am express operated routes mostly from new york as well as berlin germany miami services were added in  however the regional pan am express operation provided only an incremental feed to pan ams international route system which was now focused on the atlantic division us east coast shuttleedit in an attempt to gain a presence on the busy washington–new york–boston commuter air corridor the ransome acquisition was accompanied by the  million purchase of new york airs shuttle service between boston new york and washington dc this parallel move was intended to enable pan am to provide a highfrequency service for highyield business travelers in direct competition with the longestablished successful eastern air lines shuttle operation the renamed pan am shuttle began operating out of

jfk and miami it was also intended to help the airline regain its status as a global airline by reestablishing a sizable transpacific presence the merger was expected to result in annual savings of  million however billionaire financier al checchi outbid pan am by presenting northwests directors with a superior proposal fallout from – persian gulf waredit the first gulf war triggered by the iraqi invasion of kuwait on august   sent fuel prices skyrocketing which severely depressed global economic activity this in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand plunging once profitable operations including pan ams prime transatlantic routes into steep losses these unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to pan am which was still reeling from the  lockerbie disaster to shore up its finances pan am sold most of its routes serving london heathrow – arguably pan ams most important international destination – to united airlines this left pan am with only two daily london flights serving detroit and miami which used gatwick as their london terminal from the start of the  winter timetable further asset disposals included pan ams sale of its igs routes to

jets and computerized reservation systems it was also a founding member of the international air transport association iata the global airline industry association identified by its blue globe logo the blue meatball the use of the word clipper in aircraft names and call signs and the white pilot uniform caps the airline was a cultural icon of the th century in an era dominated by flag carriers

company on march   by air corps majors henry h hap arnold carl a spaatz and john h jouett as a counterbalance to the germanowned colombian carrier scadta operating in colombia since  scadta lobbied hard for landing rights in the panama canal zone ostensibly to survey air routes for a connection to the united states which the air corps viewed as a precursor to a possible german aerial threat to the canal arnold and spaatz drew up the prospectus for pan american when scadta hired a company in delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the us government pan american was able to obtain the us mail delivery contract to cuba but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in cuba on june   juan trippe formed the aviation corporation of the americas aca with the backing of powerful and politically connected financiers who included cornelius vanderbilt whitney and w averell harriman and raised  in startup capital from the sale of stock their operation had the allimportant landing rights for havana having acquired american international airways a small airline established in  by john k montgomery and richard b bevier as a seaplane service from key west florida to havana aca met its deadline of having an air mail service operating by october   by chartering a fairchild fc floatplane from a small dominican republic carrier west indian aerial express the atlantic gulf and caribbean airways company was established on october   by new york city investment banker richard hoyt who served as president this company merged with paa and aca on june   richard hoyt was named as president of the new aviation corporation of the americas but trippe and his partners held  of the equity and whitney was made president trippe became operational head of pan american airways the new companys principal operating subsidiary flown cover autographed by pilot cy caldwell and carried from key west fl to havana cuba on the first contract air mail flight operated by pan american airways oct   birthplace of pan american world airways key west florida the us government approved the original pan ams mail delivery contract with little objection out of fears that scadta would have no competition in bidding for routes between latin america and the united states the government further helped pan am by insulating it from its us competitors seeing the airline as the chosen instrument for usbased international air routes the airline expanded internationally benefiting from a virtual monopoly on foreign routes trippe and his associates planned to extend pan ams network through all of central and south america during the late s and early s pan am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in central and south america and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the governments airmail contracts to the region in september  trippe toured latin america with charles lindbergh to negotiate landing rights in a number of countries including barranquilla on scadtas home turf of colombia maracaibo and caracas by the end of the year pan am offered flights along the west coast of south america to peru the following year pan am purchased the new york rio and buenos aires line giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of south america to buenos aires argentina and westbound to santiago chile its brazilian subsidiary nyrba do brasil was later renamed as panair do brasil pan am also partnered with grace shipping company in  to form pan americangrace airways better known as panagra to gain a foothold to destinations in south america in the same year pan am acquired a controlling stake in mexicana de aviación and took over mexicanas ford trimotor route between brownsville texas and mexico city extending this service to the yucatan peninsula to connect with pan ams caribbean route network pan ams holding company the aviation corporation of the americas was one of the most sought after stocks on the new york curb exchange in  and flurries of speculation surrounded each of its new route awards in april  trippe and his associates reached an agreement with united aircraft and transport corporation uatc to segregate pan am operations to south of the mexico – united states border in exchange for uatc taking a large shareholder stake uatc was the parent company of what are now boeing pratt  whitney and united airlines the aviation corporation of the americas changed its name to pan american airways corporation in  flight crewsedit the sikorsky s was one of pan ams earlier flying boats and was used to survey the san francisco – china route critical to pan ams success as an airline was the proficiency of its flight crews who were rigorously trained in longdistance flight seaplane anchorage and berthing operations overwater navigation radio procedure aircraft repair and marine tides during the day use of the compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure at night all flight crews were trained to use celestial navigation in bad weather pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns making successful landings at foggedin harbors by landing out to sea then taxiing the plane into port many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates a pan am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic steadily gaining his licenses and working his way up the flight crew roster to navigator second officer and first officer before world war ii it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at remote locations pan ams mechanics and support staff were similarly trained newly hired applicants were frequently paired with experienced flight mechanics in several areas of the company until they had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties as might be expected in a small foreign port without an aviation infrastructure or even an adequate road network many crews supported repair operations by flying in spare parts to planes stranded overseas in some cases performing repairs themselves clipper eraedit paa routes as of   advertising mailer for pan ams flying clipper cruises to south america pan am started its south american routes with consolidated

douglas dcb operating an internal german service at hanover airport in may  from  until  pan am operated a comprehensive network of highfrequency shorthaul scheduled services between west germany and west berlin first with douglas dcs then with dcbs from  and boeing s from  this had come about as a result of an agreement between the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union at the end of world war ii which prohibited germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services from and to berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries rising cold war tensions between the soviet union and the three western powers resulted in unilateral soviet withdrawal from the quadripartite allied control commission in  culminating in the division of germany the following year these events together with soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the postwar agreement on the western powers access rights to berlin meant that until the end of the cold war air transport in west berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the remaining allied control commission powers with aircraft required to fly across hostile east german territory through three  mi  km wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of  ft  mnb  the airlines west berlin operation consistently accounted for more than half of the

for pan am through the late s and early s and in the mids there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as american airlines eastern air lines trans world airlines or united

texas international that boosted nationals stock price but pan am was granted permission to buy national in  in what was described as the coup of the decade the acquisition of national airlines for  million further burdened pan ams balance sheet already under strain after financing the boeing s ordered in the mids this acquisition did little to improve pan ams competitive position in relation to nimbler lowercost competitors in a deregulated industry as nationals northsouth route structure provided insufficient feed at pan ams transatlantic and transpacific gateways in new york and los angeles the airlines had incompatible fleets apart from the boeing  and corporate cultures partly as a result of the former being perceived by some pan am employees as mainly a regional backwoods carrier with few trunk routes and the integration was poorly handled by pan am management who presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing nationals pay scales with pan ams

combined sale value of the intercontinental chain and the falcon jet corp stake was  million acker followed up the asset disposal program he had inherited from his predecessor with operational cutbacks most prominent among these was the discontinuation of the roundthe world service from october   when pan am ceased flying between delhi bangkok and hong kong due to the sectors unprofitability to provide additional seating capacity for its  springsummer season the airline also acquired three passenger boeing bs from flying tigers who took four pan ams – freighters in return

company on march   by air corps majors henry h hap arnold carl a spaatz and john h jouett as a counterbalance to the germanowned colombian carrier scadta operating in colombia since  scadta lobbied hard for landing rights in the panama canal zone ostensibly to survey air routes for a connection to the united states which the air corps viewed as a precursor to a possible german aerial threat to the canal arnold and spaatz drew up the prospectus for pan american when scadta hired a company in delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the us government pan american was able to obtain the us mail delivery contract to cuba but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in cuba on june   juan trippe formed the aviation corporation of the americas aca with the backing of powerful and politically connected financiers who included cornelius vanderbilt whitney and w averell harriman and raised  in startup capital from the sale of stock their operation had the allimportant landing rights for havana having acquired american international airways a small airline established in  by john k montgomery and richard b bevier as a seaplane service from key west florida to havana aca met its deadline of having an air mail service operating by october   by chartering a fairchild fc floatplane from a small dominican republic carrier west indian aerial express the atlantic gulf and caribbean airways company was established on october   by new york city investment banker richard hoyt who served as president this company merged with paa and aca on june   richard hoyt was named as president of the new aviation corporation of the americas but trippe and his partners held  of the equity and whitney was made president trippe became operational head of pan american airways the new companys principal operating subsidiary flown cover autographed by pilot cy caldwell and carried from key west fl to havana cuba on the first contract air mail flight operated by pan american airways oct   birthplace of pan american world airways key west florida the us government approved the original pan ams mail delivery contract with little objection out of fears that scadta would have no competition in bidding for routes between latin america and the united states the government further helped pan am by insulating it from its us competitors seeing the airline as the chosen instrument for usbased international air routes the airline expanded internationally benefiting from a virtual monopoly on foreign routes trippe and his associates planned to extend pan ams network through all of central and south america during the late s and early s pan am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in central and south america and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the governments airmail contracts to the region in september  trippe toured latin america with charles lindbergh to negotiate landing rights in a number of countries including barranquilla on scadtas home turf of colombia maracaibo and caracas by the end of the year pan am offered flights along the west coast of south america to peru the following year pan am purchased the new york rio and buenos aires line giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of south america to buenos aires argentina and westbound to santiago chile its brazilian subsidiary nyrba do brasil was later renamed as panair do brasil pan am also partnered with grace shipping company in  to form pan americangrace airways better known as panagra to gain a foothold to destinations in south america in the same year pan am acquired a controlling stake in mexicana de aviación and took over mexicanas ford trimotor route between brownsville texas and mexico city extending this service to the yucatan peninsula to connect with pan ams caribbean route network pan ams holding company the aviation corporation of the americas was one of the most sought after stocks on the new york curb exchange in  and flurries of speculation surrounded each of its new route awards in april  trippe and his associates reached an agreement with united aircraft and transport corporation uatc to segregate pan am operations to south of the mexico – united states border in exchange for uatc taking a large shareholder stake uatc was the parent company of what are now boeing pratt  whitney and united airlines the aviation corporation of the americas changed its name to pan american airways corporation in  flight crewsedit the sikorsky s was one of pan ams earlier flying boats and was used to survey the san francisco – china route critical to pan ams success as an airline was the proficiency of its flight crews who were rigorously trained in longdistance flight seaplane anchorage and berthing operations overwater navigation radio procedure aircraft repair and marine tides during the day use of the compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure at night all flight crews were trained to use celestial navigation in bad weather pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns making successful landings at foggedin harbors by landing out to sea then taxiing the plane into port many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates a pan am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic steadily gaining his licenses and working his way up the flight crew roster to navigator second officer and first officer before world war ii it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at remote locations pan ams mechanics and support staff were similarly trained newly hired applicants were frequently paired with experienced flight mechanics in several areas of the company until they had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties as might be expected in a small foreign port without an aviation infrastructure or even an adequate road network many crews supported repair operations by flying in spare parts to planes stranded overseas in some cases performing repairs themselves clipper eraedit paa routes as of   advertising mailer for pan ams flying clipper cruises to south america pan am started its south american routes with consolidated

was shortlived as all were commandeered for military service when the united states entered world war ii the clippers — the name hearkened back to the th century clipper ships – were the only american passenger aircraft of the time capable of intercontinental travel to compete with ocean liners the airline offered firstclass seats on such flights and the style of flight crews became more formal instead of being leatherjacketed silkscarved airmail pilots the crews of the clippers wore navalstyle uniforms and adopted a set procession when boarding the aircraft while waiting at foynes county

heathrow in  growing competition after world war iiedit air transports growing importance in the postwar era meant that pan am would no longer enjoy the official patronage it had been afforded in prewar days to prevent the emergence of any meaningful competition both at home and abroad although pan am continued to use its political influence to lobby for protection of its position as americas primary international airline it encountered increasing competition — first from american export airlines american overseas airlines aoa from november  across the atlantic to europe and subsequently from others including twa to europe braniff to south america united to hawaii and northwest orient to east asia as well as five potential rivals to mexico this changed situation resulted from the new postwar approach the civil aeronautics board cab took towards the promotion of competition between major us carriers on key domestic and international scheduled routes compared with prewar us aviation

reservations which was installed in  it also held large amounts of information about cities countries airports aircraft hotels and restaurants the computer occupied the fourth floor of the pan am building which was the largest commercial office building in the world for some time the airline also built worldport a terminal building at john f kennedy airport in new york it was distinguished by its elliptical fouracre  m² roof suspended far from the outside columns of the terminal below by  sets of steel posts and cables the terminal was designed to allow passengers to board and disembark via stairs without getting wet by parking the nose of the aircraft under the overhang the introduction of the jetbridge made this feature obsolete pan am built a gilded training building in the style of edward durell stone designed by stewardskinner architects in miami peakedit at its peak in the late s and early s pan am advertised under the slogan the worlds most experienced airline it carried  million passengers in  and by  its  jets flew to  countries on every continent except for antarctica over a scheduled route network of  unduplicated miles  km during that period the airline was profitable and its cash reserves totaled  billion most routes were between new york europe and south america and between miami and the caribbean in  pan am began a helicopter shuttle between new yorks

owned the intercontinental hotel chain and had a financial interest in the falcon jet corporation which held marketing rights to the dassault falcon  business jet in north america the airline was involved in creating a missiletracking range in the south atlantic and operating a nuclearengine testing laboratory in nevada in addition pan am participated in several notable humanitarian flights at its height pan am was well regarded for its modern fleet and experienced crews cabin staff were multilingual and usually college graduates hired from around the world frequently with nursing training pan ams onboard service and cuisine inspired by maxims de paris were delivered with a personal flair that has rarely been equaled internal german services igs and other operationsedit pan american douglas dcb operating an internal german service at hanover airport in may  from  until  pan am operated a comprehensive network of highfrequency shorthaul scheduled services between west germany and west berlin first with douglas dcs then with dcbs from  and boeing s from  this had come about as a result of an agreement between the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union at the end of world war ii which prohibited germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services from and to berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries rising cold war tensions between the soviet union and the three western powers resulted in unilateral soviet withdrawal from the quadripartite allied control commission in  culminating in the division of germany the following year these events together with soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the postwar agreement on the western powers access rights to berlin meant that until the end of the cold war air transport in west berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the remaining allied control commission powers with aircraft required to fly across hostile east german territory through three  mi  km wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of  ft  mnb  the airlines west berlin operation consistently accounted for more than half of the citys entire commercial air traffic during that period for years more passengers boarded pan am flights at berlin templehof than at any other airport pan am operated a berlin crew base of mainly german flight attendants and american pilots to staff its igs flights the german national flight attendants were later taken over by lufthansa when it acquired pan ams berlin route authorities over the years other local flight attendant bases outside the us included london for intraeurope and transatlantic flying warsaw istanbul and belgrade for intraeurope flights a tel aviv base solely

kennedy airport in may  fallout from  oil crisisedit pan am had invested in a large fleet of boeing s expecting that air travel would continue to increase it didnt as the introduction of many widebodies by pan am and its competitors coincided with an economic slowdown reduced air travel after the  oil crisis made the overcapacity problem worse pan am was vulnerable with its high overheads and fixed costs as a result of a large decentralized infrastructure high fuel prices and its many older less fuelefficient narrowbodied airplanes increased the airlines operating costs federal route awards to other airlines such as the transpacific route case further reduced the number of passengers pan am carried and its profit margins a pan am flight attendant in s uniform on september   a group of pan am employees published an advertisement in the new york times to register their disagreement over federal policies which they felt were harming the financial viability of their employer the ad cited discrepancies in airport landing fees such as pan am paying  to land a plane in sydney while the australian carrier qantas paid only  to land a jet in los angeles the ad also contended that the united states postal service was paying foreign airlines five times as much to carry us mail in comparison to pan am finally the ad questioned why the exportimport bank of the united states loaned money to japan france and saudi arabia at  interest while pan am paid  by the mids pan am had racked up  million of accumulated losses over a year period and its debts approached  billion this threatened the airline with bankruptcy former american airlines vice president of operations william t seawell who had replaced najeeb halaby as pan am president in  began implementing a turnaround strategy trimming the network by  slashing the strong workforce by  and cutting wages introducing stringent economies and rescheduling debt and reducing the size of the fleet these measures aided by the use of taxloss credits enabled pan am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in  attempts to build a us domestic networkedit since the s juan trippe had coveted domestic routes for pan am through the late s and early s and in the mids there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as american airlines eastern air lines trans world airlines or united airlines as rival airlines convinced congress that pan am would use its political clout to monopolize us air routes the cab repeatedly denied the airline permission to operate in the us by growth or by a merger with another airline pan am remained an american carrier operating international routes only aside from hawaii and alaska the last time pan am was permitted to merge with another airline prior to the deregulation of the us airline industry was in  when it took over american overseas airlines from american airlines after deregulation in  more us domestic airlines began competing with pan am internationally national airlines takeoveredit to acquire domestic routes pan am under president seawell set its eyes on national airlines pan am wound up in a bidding war with frank lorenzos texas international that boosted nationals stock price but pan am was granted permission to buy national in  in what was described as the coup of the decade the acquisition of national airlines for  million further burdened pan ams balance sheet already under strain after financing the boeing s ordered in the mids this acquisition did little to improve pan ams competitive position in relation to nimbler lowercost competitors in a deregulated industry as nationals northsouth route structure provided insufficient feed at pan ams transatlantic and transpacific gateways in new york and los angeles the airlines had incompatible fleets apart from the boeing  and corporate cultures partly as a result of the former being perceived by some pan am employees as mainly a regional backwoods carrier with few trunk routes and the integration was poorly handled by pan am management who presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing nationals pay scales with pan ams although revenues increased by  from  to  fuel costs from the merger increased by  during a weak economic climate further miscellaneous expenses increased by  clipper spreeathen at zürich in  disposal of noncore assets and operational cutbacksedit as  progressed and the airlines financial situation worsened seawell began selling pan ams noncore assets the first asset to be sold off was the airlines  interest in falcon jet corporation in august later in november pan am sold the pan am building to the metropolitan life insurance company for  million in september  pan am sold off its intercontinental hotels chain before this transaction closed seawell was replaced by c edward acker air floridas founder and expresident as well as a former braniff international executive the combined sale value of the intercontinental chain and the falcon jet corp stake was  million acker followed up the asset disposal program he had inherited from his predecessor with operational cutbacks most prominent among these was the discontinuation of the roundthe world service from october   when pan am ceased flying between delhi bangkok and hong kong due to the sectors unprofitability to provide additional seating capacity for its  springsummer season the airline also acquired three passenger boeing bs from flying tigers who took four pan ams – freighters in return fleet restructuringedit despite pan ams precarious financial situation in summer  acker went ahead with an order for new airbus models in wide body and narrowbodied aircraft becoming the second american company to order airbus aircraft after eastern air lines these advanced aircraft economically and operationally superior to the s and s pan am operated at the time were intended to make the airline more competitive new as began replacing s on the internal german services igs and caribbean networks later the same year while new as later replaced some of the s on the slimmeddown transatlantic network following etops certification approval by the federal aviation administration faa of transoceanic flying with twinengined aircraft pan ams decision not to take delivery of the as and to sell its delivery positions to braniff meant that the majority of its shorthaul us domestic and european feeder routes and most of its igs services continued to be flown with obsolete s until the airlines demise this put it at a disadvantage against rivals operating stateoftheart aircraft with greater passenger appeal in september  pan american world airways created a holding company called pan am corporation to assume ownership and control of the airline and the services division sale of pacific divisionedit given the airlines dire state in april  acker sold pan ams entire pacific division which consisted of  of its entire route system to united airlines for  million this sale also enabled pan am to address fleet incompatibility issues related to the earlier acquisition

company on march   by air corps majors henry h hap arnold carl a spaatz and john h jouett as a counterbalance to the germanowned colombian carrier scadta operating in colombia since  scadta lobbied hard for landing rights in the panama canal zone ostensibly to survey air routes for a connection to the united states which the air corps viewed as a precursor to a possible german aerial threat to the canal arnold and spaatz drew up the prospectus for pan american when scadta hired a company in delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the us government pan american was able to obtain the us mail delivery contract to cuba but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in cuba on june   juan trippe formed the aviation corporation of the americas aca with the backing of powerful and politically connected financiers who included cornelius vanderbilt whitney and w averell harriman and raised  in startup capital from the sale of stock their operation had the allimportant landing rights for havana having acquired american international airways a small airline established in  by john k montgomery and richard b bevier as a seaplane service from key west florida to havana aca met its deadline of having an air mail service operating by october   by chartering a fairchild fc floatplane from a small dominican republic carrier west indian aerial express the atlantic gulf and caribbean airways company was established on october   by new york city investment banker richard hoyt who served as president this company merged with paa and aca on june   richard hoyt was named as president of the new aviation corporation of the americas but trippe and his partners held  of the equity and whitney was made president trippe became operational head of pan american airways the new companys principal operating subsidiary flown cover autographed by pilot cy caldwell and carried from key west fl to havana cuba on the first contract air mail flight operated by pan american airways oct   birthplace of pan american world airways key west florida the us government approved the original pan ams mail delivery contract with little objection out of fears that scadta would have no competition in bidding for routes between latin america and the united states the government further helped pan am by insulating it from its us competitors seeing the airline as the chosen instrument for usbased international air routes the airline expanded internationally benefiting from a virtual monopoly on foreign routes trippe and his associates planned to extend pan ams network through all of central and south america during the late s and early s pan am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in central and south america and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the governments airmail contracts to the region in september  trippe toured latin america with charles lindbergh to negotiate landing rights in a number of countries including barranquilla on scadtas home turf of colombia maracaibo and caracas by the end of the year pan am offered flights along the west coast of south america to peru the following year pan am purchased the new york rio and buenos aires line giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of south america to buenos aires argentina and westbound to santiago chile its brazilian subsidiary nyrba do brasil was later renamed as panair do brasil pan am also partnered with grace shipping company in  to form pan americangrace airways better known as panagra to gain a foothold to destinations in south america in the same year pan am acquired a controlling stake in mexicana de aviación and took over mexicanas ford trimotor route between brownsville texas and mexico city extending this service to the yucatan peninsula to connect with pan ams caribbean route network pan ams holding company the aviation corporation of the americas was one of the most sought after stocks on the new york curb exchange in  and flurries of speculation surrounded each of its new route awards in april  trippe and his associates reached an agreement with united aircraft and transport corporation uatc to segregate pan am operations to south of the mexico – united states border in exchange for uatc taking a large shareholder stake uatc was the parent company of what are now boeing pratt  whitney and united airlines the aviation corporation of the americas changed its name to pan american airways corporation in  flight crewsedit the sikorsky s was one of pan ams earlier flying boats and was used to survey the san francisco – china route critical to pan ams success as an airline was the proficiency of its flight crews who were rigorously trained in longdistance flight seaplane anchorage and berthing operations overwater navigation radio procedure aircraft repair and marine tides during the day use of the compass while judging drift from sea currents was normal procedure at night all flight crews were trained to use celestial navigation in bad weather pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns making successful landings at foggedin harbors by landing out to sea then taxiing the plane into port many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates a pan am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic steadily gaining his licenses and working his way up the flight crew roster to navigator second officer and first officer before world war ii it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at remote locations pan ams mechanics and support staff were similarly trained newly hired applicants were frequently paired with experienced flight mechanics in several areas of the company until they had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties as might be expected in a small foreign port without an aviation infrastructure or even an adequate road network many crews supported repair operations by flying in spare parts to planes stranded overseas in some cases performing repairs themselves clipper eraedit paa routes as of   advertising mailer for pan ams flying clipper cruises to south america pan am started its south american routes with consolidated

was shortlived as all were commandeered for military service when the united states entered world war ii the clippers — the name hearkened back to the th century clipper ships – were the only american passenger aircraft of the time capable of intercontinental travel to compete with ocean liners the airline offered firstclass seats on such flights and the style of flight crews became more formal

heathrow in  growing competition after world war iiedit air transports growing importance in the postwar era meant that pan am would no longer enjoy the official patronage it had been afforded in prewar days to prevent the emergence of any meaningful competition both at home and abroad although pan am continued to use its political influence to lobby for protection of its position as americas primary international airline it encountered increasing competition — first from american export airlines american overseas airlines aoa from november  across the atlantic to europe and subsequently from others including twa to europe braniff to south america united to hawaii and northwest orient to east asia as well as five potential rivals to mexico this changed situation resulted from the new postwar approach the civil aeronautics board cab took towards the promotion of competition between major us carriers on key domestic and international scheduled routes compared with prewar us aviation

douglas dcb operating an internal german service at hanover airport in may  from  until  pan am operated a comprehensive network of highfrequency shorthaul scheduled services between west germany and west berlin first with douglas dcs then with dcbs from  and boeing s from  this had come about as a result of an agreement between the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union at the end of world war ii which prohibited germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services from and to berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries rising cold war tensions between the soviet union and the three western powers resulted in unilateral soviet withdrawal from the quadripartite allied control commission in  culminating in the division of germany the following year these events together with soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the postwar agreement on the western powers access rights to berlin meant that until the end of the cold war air transport in west berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the remaining allied control commission powers with aircraft required to fly across hostile east german territory through three  mi  km wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of  ft  mnb  the airlines west berlin operation consistently accounted for more than half of the

widebodies by pan am and its competitors coincided with an economic slowdown reduced air travel after the  oil crisis made the overcapacity problem worse pan am was vulnerable with its high overheads and fixed costs as a result of a large decentralized infrastructure high fuel prices and its many older less fuelefficient narrowbodied airplanes increased the airlines operating costs federal route awards to other airlines such as the transpacific route case further reduced the number of passengers pan am carried and its profit margins a pan am flight attendant in s uniform on september   a group of pan am employees published an advertisement in the new york times to register their disagreement over federal policies which they felt were harming the financial viability of their employer the ad cited discrepancies in airport landing fees such as pan am paying  to land a plane in sydney while the australian carrier qantas paid only  to land a jet in los angeles the ad also contended that the united states postal service was paying foreign airlines five times as much to carry us mail in comparison to pan am finally the ad questioned why the exportimport bank of the united states

threatened the airline with bankruptcy former american airlines vice president of operations william t seawell who had replaced najeeb halaby as pan am president in  began implementing a turnaround strategy trimming the network by  slashing the strong workforce by  and cutting wages introducing stringent economies and rescheduling debt and reducing the size of the fleet these measures aided by the use of taxloss credits enabled pan am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in  attempts to build a us domestic networkedit since the s juan trippe had coveted domestic routes for pan am through the late s and early s and in the mids there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as american airlines eastern air lines trans world airlines or united airlines as rival airlines convinced congress that pan am would use its political clout to monopolize us air routes the cab repeatedly denied the airline permission to operate in the us by growth or by a merger with another airline pan am remained an american carrier operating international routes only aside from hawaii and alaska the last time pan am was permitted to merge with another airline prior to the deregulation of the us airline industry was in  when it took over american overseas airlines from american airlines after deregulation in  more us domestic airlines began competing with pan am internationally national airlines takeoveredit to acquire domestic routes pan am under president seawell set its eyes on national airlines pan am wound up in a bidding war with frank lorenzos texas international that boosted nationals stock price but pan am was granted permission to buy national in  in what was described as the coup of the decade the acquisition of national airlines for  million further burdened pan ams balance sheet already under strain after financing the boeing s ordered in the mids this acquisition did little to improve pan ams competitive position in relation to nimbler lowercost competitors in a deregulated industry as nationals northsouth route structure provided insufficient feed at pan ams transatlantic and transpacific gateways in new york and los angeles the airlines had incompatible fleets apart from the boeing  and corporate cultures partly as a result of the former being perceived by some pan am employees as mainly a regional backwoods carrier with few trunk routes and the integration was poorly handled by pan am management who presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing nationals pay scales with pan ams although revenues increased by  from  to  fuel costs from the merger increased by  during a weak economic climate further miscellaneous expenses increased by  clipper spreeathen at zürich in  disposal

intercontinental hotels chain before this transaction closed seawell was replaced by c edward acker air floridas founder and expresident as well as a former braniff international executive the combined sale value of the intercontinental chain and the falcon jet corp stake was  million acker followed up the asset disposal program he had inherited from his predecessor with operational cutbacks most prominent among these was the discontinuation of the roundthe world service from october   when pan am ceased flying between delhi bangkok and hong kong due to the sectors unprofitability to provide additional seating capacity for its  springsummer season the airline also acquired three passenger boeing bs from flying tigers who took four pan ams – freighters in return fleet restructuringedit despite pan ams precarious financial situation in summer  acker went ahead with an order for new airbus models in wide body and narrowbodied aircraft becoming the second american company to order airbus aircraft after eastern air lines these advanced aircraft economically and operationally superior to the s and s pan am operated at the time were intended to make the

transatlantic network following etops certification approval by the federal aviation administration faa of transoceanic flying with twinengined aircraft pan ams decision not to take delivery of the as and to sell its delivery positions to braniff meant that the majority of its shorthaul us domestic and european feeder routes and most of its igs services continued to be flown with obsolete s until the airlines demise this put it at a disadvantage against rivals operating stateoftheart aircraft with greater passenger appeal in september  pan american world airways created a holding company called pan am corporation to assume ownership and control of the airline and the services division sale of pacific divisionedit given the airlines dire state in april  acker sold pan ams entire pacific division which consisted of  of its entire route system to united airlines for  million this sale also enabled pan am to address fleet incompatibility issues related to the earlier acquisition

address the issue of providing additional feed for pan ams mainline services at its hubs in new york los angeles and miami in the united states and berlin in germany the renamed pan am express operated routes mostly from new york as well as berlin germany miami services were added in  however the regional pan am express operation provided only an incremental feed to pan ams international route system which was now focused on the atlantic division us east coast shuttleedit in an attempt to gain a presence on the busy washington–new york–boston commuter air corridor the ransome acquisition was accompanied by the  million purchase of new york airs shuttle service between boston new york and washington dc this parallel move was intended to enable pan am to provide a highfrequency service for highyield business travelers in direct competition with the longestablished successful eastern air lines shuttle operation the renamed pan am shuttle began operating out of

jfk and miami it was also intended to help the airline regain its status as a global airline by reestablishing a sizable transpacific presence the merger was expected to result in annual savings of  million however billionaire financier al checchi outbid pan am by presenting northwests directors with a superior proposal fallout from – persian gulf waredit the first gulf war triggered by the iraqi invasion of kuwait on august   sent fuel prices skyrocketing which severely depressed global economic activity this in turn caused a sharp contraction of worldwide air travel demand plunging once profitable operations including pan ams prime transatlantic routes into steep losses these unforeseen events constituted a further major blow to pan am which was still reeling from the  lockerbie

daily london flights serving detroit and miami which used gatwick as their london terminal from the start of the  winter timetable further asset disposals included pan ams sale of its igs routes to

company on march   by air corps majors henry h hap arnold carl a spaatz and john h jouett as a counterbalance to the germanowned colombian carrier scadta operating in colombia since  scadta lobbied hard for landing rights in the panama canal zone ostensibly to survey air routes for a connection to the united states which the air corps viewed as a precursor to a possible german aerial threat to the canal arnold and spaatz drew up the prospectus for pan american when scadta hired a company in delaware to obtain air mail contracts from the us government pan american was able to obtain the us mail delivery contract to cuba but lacked any aircraft to perform the job and did not have landing rights in cuba on june   juan trippe formed the aviation corporation of the americas aca with the backing of powerful and politically connected financiers who included cornelius vanderbilt whitney and w averell harriman and raised  in startup capital from the sale of stock their operation had the allimportant landing rights for havana having acquired american international airways a small airline established in  by john k montgomery and richard b bevier as a seaplane service from key west

by pan american airways oct   birthplace of pan american world airways key west florida the us government approved the original pan ams mail delivery contract with little objection out of fears that scadta would have no competition in bidding for routes between latin america and the united states the government further helped pan am by insulating it from its us competitors seeing the airline as the chosen instrument for usbased international air routes the airline expanded internationally benefiting from a virtual monopoly on foreign routes trippe and his associates planned to extend pan ams network through all of central and south america during the late s and early s pan am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in central and south america and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the governments airmail contracts to the region in september  trippe toured latin america with charles lindbergh to negotiate landing rights in a number of countries including barranquilla on scadtas home turf of colombia maracaibo and caracas by the end of the year pan am offered flights along the west coast of south america to peru the following year pan am purchased the new york rio and buenos aires line giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of south america to buenos aires argentina and westbound to santiago chile its brazilian subsidiary nyrba do brasil was later renamed as panair do brasil pan am also partnered with grace shipping company in  to form pan americangrace airways better known as panagra to gain a foothold to destinations in south

trained to use celestial navigation in bad weather pilots used dead reckoning and timed turns making successful landings at foggedin harbors by landing out to sea then taxiing the plane into port many pilots had merchant marine certifications and radio licenses as well as pilot certificates a pan am flight captain would normally begin his career years earlier as a radio operator or even mechanic steadily gaining his licenses and working his way up the flight crew roster to navigator second officer and first officer before world war ii it was not unusual for a captain to make engine repairs at

had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties as might be

douglas dcb operating an internal german service at hanover airport in may  from  until  pan am operated a comprehensive network of highfrequency shorthaul scheduled services between west germany and west berlin first with douglas dcs then with dcbs from  and boeing s from  this had come about as a result of an agreement between the united states the united kingdom france and the soviet union at the end of world war ii which prohibited germany from having its own airlines and restricted the provision of commercial air services from and to berlin to air transport providers headquartered in these four countries rising cold war tensions between the soviet union and the three western powers resulted in unilateral soviet withdrawal from the quadripartite allied control commission in  culminating in the division of germany the following year these events together with soviet insistence on a very narrow interpretation of the postwar agreement on the western powers access rights to berlin meant that until the end of the cold war air transport in west berlin continued to be confined to the carriers of the remaining allied control commission powers with aircraft required to fly across hostile east german territory through three  mi  km wide air corridors at a maximum altitude of  ft  mnb  the airlines west berlin operation consistently accounted for more than half of the

for pan am through the late s and early s and in the mids there were talks of merging the airline with a domestic operator such as american airlines eastern air lines trans world airlines or united

texas international that boosted nationals stock price but pan am was granted permission to buy national in  in what was described as the coup of the decade the acquisition of national airlines for  million further burdened pan ams balance sheet already under strain after financing the boeing s ordered in the mids this acquisition did little to improve pan ams competitive position in relation to nimbler lowercost competitors in a deregulated industry as nationals northsouth route structure provided insufficient feed at pan ams transatlantic and transpacific gateways in new york and los angeles the airlines had incompatible fleets apart from the boeing  and corporate cultures partly as a result of the former being perceived by some pan am employees as mainly a regional backwoods carrier with few trunk routes and the integration was poorly handled by pan am management who presided over an increase in labor costs as a result of harmonizing nationals pay scales with pan ams

combined sale value of the intercontinental chain and the falcon jet corp stake was  million acker followed up the asset disposal program he had inherited from his predecessor with operational cutbacks most prominent among these was the discontinuation of the roundthe world service from october   when pan am ceased flying between delhi bangkok and hong kong due to the sectors unprofitability to provide additional seating capacity for its  springsummer season the airline also acquired three passenger boeing bs from flying tigers who took four pan ams – freighters in return

transatlantic network following etops certification approval by the federal aviation administration faa of transoceanic flying with twinengined aircraft pan ams decision not to take delivery of the as
