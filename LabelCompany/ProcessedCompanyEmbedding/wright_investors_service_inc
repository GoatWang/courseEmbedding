voting proxy voting policies proxy voting policy and procedures summary as a registered investment advisor wright investors’ service is entrusted by its clients to vote proxies for their accounts wright takes seriously its duty to monitor corporate events and to vote proxies in the best interests of its clients following is a summary of wright’s proxy voting policy and procedures general policy wright’s general policy is to vote proxies in a manner that is generally intended to support the ability of management of a company soliciting proxies to run its business in a responsible and cost effective manner while staying focused on maximizing shareholder value wright’s equity selection for portfolios is determined by a series of quality screens which measure both current and long term financial strength profitability stability and growth of a company these quality screens measure to what extent corporate managements have acted in the best interests of their shareholders over the long term this reflects a basic investment philosophy that good management is shareholderfocused however all proxy votes are ultimately cast on a casebycase basis taking into account the foregoing principle and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time of the vote for this reason consistent with wright’s fiduciary duty to ensure that proxies are voted in the best interest of its clients wright may from time to time vote proxies against management’s recommendations in accordance with certain guidelines included in its proxy voting policy and procedures certain issues arise frequently as proxy proposals including executive compensation performancebased stock options shareholder approval of antitakeover measures for example poison pills and shareholders’ rights to call a special meeting however wright’s actual voting decisions are made on a casebycase basis depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each proxy vote wright’s compliance officer “co” will assess the extent if any to which there may be a material conflict between the interests of our clients and our own interests proxy proposals that present potential conflicts of interest between wright and its clients will be brought to the attention of wright’s chief executive officer who is authorized to resolve the conflict in a manner that is in the collective best interests of wright’s clients wright’s compliance office will from time to time review its proxy voting policy and procedures and may adopt changes deemed necessary or desirable currently wright retains a third party to
