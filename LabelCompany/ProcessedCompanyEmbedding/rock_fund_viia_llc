fixed income investments are and the types that exist want to know more about fixed income view transcript q what is fixed income fixed income is nothing more than a fancy word for the world of investing in bonds and when we think about the stock market it turns out that the world of investing in bonds is much much larger what does bond investing entail well it entails interest rates and government bonds but so much more than government bonds is available to investors inside the overall bond market what are some of the other opportunities for investors in bonds include high yield bonds and investment grade bonds global opportunities in nondollardenominated developed market bonds and opportunities in emerging markets both across dollardenominated issues from sovereign that’s country issuers corporate issuers also typically in dollar form as well as local currencydenominated emerging market bonds the world of bonds goes beyond fixed income in the sense of we have floating rate bonds we have things that are in the bond market that are not bonds they are called loans that’s the bank loan market one of the attractions to the bank loan market is that it is generally a floating rate market floating rate means that rather than fixed as interest rates rise the coupons on your loans in this case can rise as well more about fixed income what are common misconceptions about fixed income investing in a changing interest rate environment many americans with investments lack a good understanding of the impact of rates on their portfolios – and even many who claim to be “knowledgeable” about fixed income have fundamental misconceptions about those investments according to new research from blackrock blackrock conducted a survey from april  to  and covered  americans with  or more in investible assets common misconceptions included nearly one third  of those surveyed incorrectly believe that when it comes to fixed income investing “you can’t lose your money” only  correctly noted that if interest rates rise the effect on the fixed income investments that investors already own is negative when interest rates rise bond prices fall  of americans surveyed don‘t consider themselves knowledgeable regarding fixed income and just  said they understand the market and economic forces that drive bond prices learn more what are the potential benefits of fixed income fixed income investments can potentially benefit investors in different ways depending on their financial goals if you are seeking to grow your assets over time to save for retirement or other longterm goals you probably hold a significant amount of equity in your portfolio allocating a portion of your portfolio to fixed income investments can potentially help offset losses when stock markets are erratic if you are seeking to generate income fixed income investments are likely a critical part of your portfolio fixed income investors receive a fixed amount of income at a predetermined cadence in the form of coupon payments on bond holdings fixed income asset classes provide different levels of yield and entail different types and amounts of risks reasons to consider bond funds  capital preservation income generation diversification from equity market risk why blackrock investors trust blackrock with more assets than any other fixed income manager our goal is to provide you with the quality and value you deserve and expect evidenced through our history of attractive performance competitive prices and a comprehensive set of offerings what are the risks associated with fixed income bonds are broadly known to carry lower risk than stocks fixed income assets generally are less sensitive to most macro threats such as economic downturns and geopolitical events but there are risks associated with fixed income investments interest rate risk garners the most attention among investors because when interest rates rise bond prices fall interest rate movements are the major cause of price volatility in bond markets inflation is another source of risk for bond investors if the rate of inflation outpaces the fixed amount of income a bond provides the investor loses purchasing power credit risk also known as business risk or financial risk refers to the possibility of an issuer defaulting on its debt obligation liquidity risk is the risk that an investor wishing to sell a fixed income asset is unable to find a buyer you can manage these risks by diversifying investments within your fixed income portfolio advisors drive increasing use of
