company specializing in discovering developing and commercializing molecular imaging pharmaceuticals with initial applications in the area of cardiology the company operates through biopharmaceutical research and development segment the company is focused on the development of cardiovascular imaging agents that can detect and assess acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease cad the company has two clinicalstage molecular imaging pharmaceutical product candidates flourine f tpp bfpet and f fcpha cardiopetbfpet f ftppthe companys bfpet program includes a flabeled cationic lipophilic tetraphenylphosphonium ion f tpp as an imaging agent designed for use in stresstesting for patients with presumptive or proven cad f ftpp measures the extent and severity of cardiovascular disease through the detection of ischemic reversible and viable and infarcted irreversibly damaged myocardial heart tissue its mechanism of action allows it to enter the myocardial cells of the heart muscle in direct proportion to blood flow and membrane potential the indicators of adequate cardiac blood supply since ischemic and infarcted myocardial cells take up less f ftpp than normal healthy myocardial cells do f ftpp can distinguish ischemic and infarcted cells from those that are healthy f ftpp has completed a phase i clinical trial in approximately  healthy volunteerscardiopet f fcphathe companys cardiopet program includes transffluoro methyleneheptadecanoic acid f fcpha as a molecular imaging agent designed to assess myocardial blood flow and metabolism in patients with cad including patients unable to perform exercise cardiac stresstesting f fcpha allows for the potential detection of ischemic reversible and viable and infarcted irreversibly damaged myocardial tissue in patients with presumptive or proven acute and chronic cad and related cardiac diseases in addition f fcpha could be useful for assessing myocardial viability for the prediction of improvement prior to andor following revascularization in patients with acute cad including myocardial infarction heart attack f fcpha allows for the identification of compromised but viable heart tissue the revascularization in those patients with substantial viable myocardium results in improved left ventricular function and survival the company has completed enrollment in a phase iia trial at four sites in belgium to assess its safety and efficacy in cad patients the company is conducting final safety and efficacy analysis » full overview of fpmipk company address fluoropharma medical inc suite

medical inc fpmi a company specializing in the development of novel diagnostic imaging products that utilize positron emission tomography pet technology for the detection and assessment of disease before clinical manifestation today announced that enrollment for this phase ii trial will be closing on december th  to date fluoropharma believes it has acquired sufficient patient data allowing for the assessment of the pharmaceuticals safety and quality of fcpha generated cardiac images in humansaccording to thijs spoor chairman and ceo of fluoropharma this trial has so far produced data on image quality the optimal time for imaging after injection and preliminary data on myocardial blood flow to date no major adverse events have been seen with any patients dosed with cardiopet as we plan for the next development steps all of this data will now be incorporated into a thorough assessment versus other clinical comparators of spect and angiography it is expected that the full data will be evaluated in a blinded read fashion and then presented early next year mr spoor continues this is a major milestone for the company we are encouraged by our progress to date and believe that cardiopet potentially signals a compelling new direction for pet cardiac imaging at a time when healthcare professionals around the world could benefit from novel diagnostic imaging that expand and improve their diagnostic capabilities symptomatic coronary artery disease affects millions of patients worldwide and accounts for the significant increase in mortalitythis phase ii clinical trial is an open label study designed to assess the safety and diagnostic performance of cardiopet f fcpha as compared to currently utilized spect myocardial perfusion imaging agents and angiography the traditional standard of care for establishing the presence of obstructive cad the trial allows the company to evaluate the dynamics and performance of fatty acid markers in patients under variable conditions at rest or with induced stress this multicenter study was conducted in belgiumcardiopet f fcpha one of fluoropharmas pet imaging products is a fatty acid uptake indicator which is designed to be used as a cardiac imaging agent and may prove to be an effective alternative to currently available diagnostic tests fluoropharma believes its pharmacokinetic characteristics could be especially valuable in patients who are unable to exercise there is no commercially available fatty acid analog marker in the us or europe where coronary disease is a major problemolivier gheysens md phd the principal investigator for the entire study noted fatty acid metabolism is affected in various degrees by the presence of coronary disease under normal conditions free fatty acids are the hearts main energy source with reduction in blood flow to the myocardium it switches its metabolism to glucose the myocardium will switch back to fatty acid metabolism when blood flow is restored and if the myocardium has not been permanently damaged cardiopet has the potential to evaluate the degree to which the myocardium has been affecteda traceable fatty acid marker such as cardiopet will allow the evaluation of cardiac blood flow as well as the dietary preference of the cardiac muscle under stress or at rest which is an indicator of the metabolic state of the heart ergo cardiac muscle viability the ability to evaluate cardiac viability provides a significant advantage in comprehensive assessment of cad in comparison to the currently utilized methods which focus mainly on hemodynamics aloneabout fluoropharma medicalfluoropharma is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary pet imaging products to evaluate cardiac disease at the cellular and molecular levels the company has licensed technology from the massachusetts general hospital in bostonthe companys goal is to enable personalized medicine through precision diagnostics that will help
