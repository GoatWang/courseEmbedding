engineering and the analysis of thermal and flow processes he applies his expertise to the investigation and prevention of failures in mechanical systems he also investigates fires and explosions and their origin and cause he consults in the utilities oil and gas and chemical industries dr kytömaa’s project experience includes consumer products intellectual property matters automobiles aircraft turbines compressors boilers steam generators pneumatic and hydraulic systems instrumentation nuclear waste management heat transfer systems fuel distribution delivery and storage systems including lng facilities dr kytömaa has decades of experience in the area of dynamics and thermal hydraulics of piping systems valves and pipelines he has developed flow modeling tools for such systems and their components and has applied these to drilling and downhole applications he pioneered the modeling of the acoustics of drilling fluid piping systems for acoustic telemetry and measurementwhiledrilling mwd which was one of the enabling technologies for directional drilling dr kytömaa has also developed ultrasonic techniques for both medical and engineering applications including instrumentation for flow measurement and the characterization of dense suspensions  dr kytömaa was assistant professor and associate professor of mechanical engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology where he was head of the fluid mechanics laboratory he has also held positions as visiting professor at the helsinki university of technology and at the doe pacific northwest
