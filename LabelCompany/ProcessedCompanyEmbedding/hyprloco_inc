gunner in operation iraqi freedom into a hightech startup by ilan mochari ilan mocharis debut novel zinsky the obscure fomite press  earned rave reviews from publishers weekly kirkus reviews and booklist bostons npr station named it one of  good reads for the summer he is a senior writer for inc magazine ilanmochari senior writer incilanmochari  comments credit shutterstock you might think you have your startups story straight until you share it with an investor or mentorand he says youre not making sense thats what happened two years ago to nic gray founder and ceo of hyprloco a denverbased startup providing locationbased marketing and analytics software to customers hyprloco ceo nic gray served in operation iraqi freedom in grays mind the story was simple his cofounder damon baker had developed some amazing locationdetection technology bakers technology was so advanced businesses could use it to track where customers were at almost any given moment imagine all the individualized marketing messages these businesses could send out imagine all the analytics theyd have access to  the problem that wasnt really grays story it was a description of technology one of grays business mentors david mandell of techstars broke the news to him he said you need to go ahead and get your story straight it’s bullshit right now  like many founders gray 3 was more comfortable talking about technology than talking about himself but at mandells urging gray learned to integrate his own story into his startups when you hear grays story youll wonderand also understandwhat took him so long  the art of storytelling theres a reason storytelling is an essential skill in the founders toolkit youre giving presentations to investors and potential customersand talented recruits you want to show your own vulnerability for thats the fastest path to mutual trust you also want to display your skills and competence  hyprloco cto damon baker served in the united states marine corps so you can go ahead and talk about your potent technology but that doesnt tell investors customers and employees what they really want to know which is whos this person im potentially trusting with my time and money  heres grays story he was deployed to baghdad in 6 in support of operation iraqi freedom he was in charge of tracking the nighttime movements of both enemy forces and nato forces he was a  cal gunner one of the challenges over there gray recalls was understanding where someone was inside of a buildingand also knowing if they were friend or foe in iraq information like that wouldve saved american lives he says he wondered what it would be like if troops on handheld mobile devices could learn the realtime locales of possible threats in their surroundings  back in the us after an honorable discharge gray became hellbent on finding a solution he met baker a former marine at a military function they began talking about their business ambitions gray shared his idea coincidentally baker had been working on this type of hyperlocation technology inspired by the movie minority report soon they became partners and cofounders gray became ceo and baker became cto  landing initial customers some founders wonder whether its worth it to join an incubator or accelerator for gray and baker the experience has been priceless gray was part of a threeday program based in washington dc called the techstars patriot boot camp pbc its exactly what it sounds like for no cost veterans and their families get to use the mentors and tools in the techstars network it was at pbc that gray met mandell and learned the importance of personalizing his story it was at pbc too that gray learned about a great offer from galvanize an entrepreneurfocused communityworkspace with locations in denver san francisco and boulder galvanize offered three months of free rent to pbc participants i used that was there a couple months and havent left says gray  so far hyprloco has three clients a las vegas casino a cruise company and a ski resort gray expects 4 revenues to reach the mid six digits not bad considering he and baker remain the only fulltime employees in landing these initial customers gray has remained vertical agnostic that is though he and baker have their ideas for which vertical markets are the most lucrative longterm fit for hyprlocos offerings his initial goal is pluck the proverbial lowhanging fruit  for example he was able to close the deal with the casino in a minute phone call it was a fast close for two reasons  gray had networked his way to the decision maker  through his personal network of military connections techstar connections and galvanize connections gray learned that this particular casino had the hardware infrastructure to rapidly integrate hyprlocos cloudbased technology  the bottom line if youre working as a oneperson sales team as gray is you need help if you cant network your way to your end customers network your way to others selling to the vertical youre targeting theyll help you reach the decision maker and thats one way to shorten the sales cycle  making connections whats next for hyprloco is a potential deal with one of americas four major sports leagues this league would use hyprlocos software to enhance the stadiumarena experience for attendees who opt in to using the product the general idea is this if a sports team or sports league knows exactly where its customers are in the building it can be smarter about offering other products and services to those customers it can also improve its marketing efforts having zeroed in demographically on the attendees cookies for the physical worldthats what we are says gray he is referring of course not to what girl scouts sell but to the online cookies that collect user information as you browse the web  how did hyprloco land a meeting with this sports league it was a techstars connection whom gray had stayed in touch with grays biggest tip for improving your networking is a classic from the dale carnegie playbook of making connections understand the potential value you can bring to them first says gray and establish that mind you gray doesnt think of his networking as networking per se from his perspective hes just being his friendly self meeting new people shaking hands asking them for coffee or a beer learning about each other and then concluding the hangouts with one simple question is there anything i can go ahead and do or any connections you need this friendly behavior is something he routinely observed in his parents it just carried over he says  a patient approach to fundraising hyprloco is projecting  revenue to exceed  million despite its hightech product the company has opted to wait before taking venture capital or angel money the big reason for being patient is a potential pitfall of private valuations which grays connections have warned him about tempting as it can be to take venture capital or angel investmentsand the prestige and networks they bring to the tablethe risk is establishing a premature and thus too low valuation for your company before youve generated revenues or attracted highleverage customers  to help their cash flow in the absence of early investors hyprloco is in the process of closing a 4 convertible note with a  interest rate and an 8month maturity date with no valuation this allows us to go ahead and increase sales and marketing says gray  the note will provide a cash bridge that will get hyprloco to the start of  at which time the company anticipates closing a series a round by which time gray also believes hell have bolstered revenues and broadened the customer base the more clients we can onboard the higher our valuation will be he says  in terms of exits gray says hyprloco is definitely expecting to be acquired in the next 8 months in his ideal exit though hed stay involved and continue to manage the company indepedently under the auspices of the right acquirer  meanwhile hell keep networking his way to potential customers and partners dont be surprised if in the next few years you find hyprlocos technology at a stadium near
