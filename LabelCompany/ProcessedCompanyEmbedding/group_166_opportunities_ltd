ton incineration boiler which uses factory wastes  fabric waste thread cones and carton boxespaper as combustion fuel biogas plant biogas is the product of the natural biological breakdown of organic  carbonrich waste when the supply of oxygen is restricted our technology extracts the value contained in nonrecyclable waste by producing ‘biogas’ a methanerich natural gas it is renewable source of energy where wastage food has been used as a raw material instead of disposing off the food waste every day the factory uses it as feedstock for its biogas plant for cooking energy management skylight prismatic skylights have been installed to reduce consumption of electricity the prismatic skylights diffuses the sun’s lights and make the interior not only bright but healthier for the occupants by improving the working environment of factories solar panel in order to manage electricity consumption solar panels have been fitted on the roof of the factories  kw solar panels have installed and it helps to meet  of the total electricity requirement of the factory hvls fans unlike the usual fans used in offices factories and houses special fans have been installed in the sewing floor of the

healthy and comfortable working atmosphere waste water treatment etp has been installed in  facilities of bitopi group to purify water and remove any toxic and non toxic materials or chemicals from it the electro catalytic oxidation technology is innovative  a first in bangladesh the reactor synthesizes nano catalysts that continuously enter the wastewater and accelerate treatment processes etp is essential to purify the waste water generated at the factory the purified water is again recycyled for washroom flush and plantation with zero hazardous materials condensate recovery system the condensate recovery system helps to conserve the steam and recover and reuse it so that the energy consumption is reduced thermos oil heater unlike conventional boilers which use watersteam as heat transfer fluid thermal oil heaters can operate at atmospheric pressure and achieve temperatures up to °c thermal oil heaters are thus relatively cheaper and convenient plus they minimize the risk of corrosion lime deposits and scale formation two of the facilities replaced  steam dryers in the wet processing section with  thermal oil heaters and  washing mc steam heating to thermal oil heating thus leading to less energy consumption water recycling water recycling is wastewater collected from rain water harvest plant and through etp as well as the wet wash process this water is used in
