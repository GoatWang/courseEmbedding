diagnostic data sets into a coherent dtreatment plan allows individualized precision tumor targeting radiation oncology has the potential to provide outstanding personalized cancer treatment however cancer cell radioresistance and normal tissue injury represent two important limitations that can limit the ability of ionizing radiation to provide localregional control of tumor growth to addresses these limitations our laboratory initiated a cancer drug discovery program that seeks to develop efficacious radiation sensitizers twoindolylmethylenequinuclidinols and nbenzylhindolylmethylenepyrimidinehhh trione have been synthesized and are currently being evaluated using defined dna substrates cellbased and murine mouse models elucidating the underlying
