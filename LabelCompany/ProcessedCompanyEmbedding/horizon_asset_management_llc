market commentary latest commentary nd quarter 7 commentary july  7 conference call replay it’s always nice to pay a lower fee for the same product who wouldn’t but what if it’s not the same the nasdaq  etf qqq fact sheet says it is filled with growth companies and only trades at x earnings the same as the sp  they don’t tell you that they exclude any companies with losses they don’t describe how they effectively eliminate the impact of companies with very pe ratios through a rather abstruse formula known as the weighted average harmonic mean in the absence of having an mba or statistical degree if you calculated the pe ratio of the nasdaq  the way you know how by simply averaging the pe ratios of the 9 profitable companies then the pe is over x it’s one thing to not know it’s another to be told what isn’t so as with every quarterly commentary we’ll review just how indexed products that purport to be low volatility or low risk or provide exposure to a given country or industry actually are not or do not you don’t get something for nothing particularly on wall street read more  st quarter 7 commentary april  7 conference call replay in past reviews we’ve titillated you with some of the more startling and storyworthy examples of the distortions caused by the indexation vortex we have chosen far flung examples in order to direct one’s attention through all the noise of conflicting information from the financial news media toward the bubble conditions that etfs have wrought but because those examples have been drawn from more marginal sectors on the market many of you might have wondered whether they are relevant to their portfolios so in this quarter’s letter we go mainstream to see what’s going on in the most basic portfolio building blocks the bread and butter asset classes first the sp  itself and then a typical mainstream growth fund and a mainstream value fund that an everyman or everywoman would use the kind of fund that is relevant read more  th quarter 6 commentary january 7 7 conference call replay this past year was interesting on so many more fronts than  and this coming year could be more interesting still in 6 the financial markets saw all sorts of records and precedents – and not in a good way we have been taking some time to prepare our client portfolios for advantage advantage hinges on the ability to make opportunistic investments to take what the market gives not what it doesn’t opportunism has a field of play when prices have declined sometimes they decline suddenly other times slowly sometimes the whole market together other times just pieces of it but entry to that field of opportunity itself hinges on having sufficient liquidity without liquidity the opportunities are just an idea of what might have been money flows into etfs and similar funds have not only pushed up the prices of the major indexcentric companies but also created an artificial downdraft among the thousands of nonindexation securities that is where the companies with less systemic risk will be found there will be more in the way of idiosyncratic investments with the opportunity for true optionality perhaps our portfolios will have to have fewer but more selective securities with perhaps larger weightings in those companies with truly discounted valuations and a truly superior business position so the watch words are

horizon kinetics llc founded in  is an independently owned and operated investment adviser we adhere to a longterm contrarian fundamental value investment philosophy that the founders established in 9 at bankers trust company horizon kinetics has over  employees with primary offices in new york city and white plains new york philosophy horizon kinetics was founded on the belief that a shortterm investment approach widely adopted with the modernization of financial markets ultimately produces suboptimal returns we believe that investors are better served not by taking more risk but by extending their investment time horizon which affords far wider ranges of opportunity and valuation than are available to timeconstrained institutional investors  the startling degree of return possibility ignored by a shortterm focus is most easily seen in the equity yield curve a chart you will not find elsewhere and while all acknowledge the tremendous power of compounding practically speaking and by definition this benefit simply cannot be harnessed in a short time frame our investment strategies – supported entirely by our independent fundamental research – typically reflect contrarian views that seek to take advantage of the shortterm focus of the marketplace find out more investment research publishing research has been the cornerstone of our investment process we believe that requiring research analysts to frame their investment ideas in writing helps avoid the common behavioral finance error of adjusting one’s investment thesis in response to shortterm market price fluctuations our research team produces a variety of research publications for the institutional investment community covering undervalued and often systematically mispriced classes of securities ranging from global spinoffs to distressed debt find out more investment strategies with a longterm absolute return mindset and based on firsthand research our portfolios tend to be concentrated and avoid tracking or mimicking any benchmark or index an investment and research process that is delinked from the standard shortterm relativereturn benchmarking that leads to crowdinvesting behavior should be expected to produce returns that are generally less correlated with other managers and funds accordingly our strategies might be considered diversifying elements within broader asset allocations horizon kinetics offers separately managed accounts mutual funds and alternative investment products suitable for individual and institutional investors through its
