artventive medical group inc is a medical device corporation focused on developing manufacturing and marketing a family of endoluminal occlusion devices known as the artventive endoluminal occlusion system artventive eostm or eostm through our patented technology we have developed minimally invasive occlusion devices and procedures capable of achieving immediate complete and permanent occlusion of peripheral vasculature we believe eostm represents a paradigm shift in the vessel occlusion marketplace through our use of a unique technology platform that when deployed immediately occludes a vessel and does not depend on waiting for blood or fluids to clot around the device we believe that this new novel technology significantly reduces risks to both patients and doctors is more cost effective than currently available products and has the potential to become the standard of care in the vessel occlusion market the artventive eostm is our proprietary technology platform which we plan to expand from peripheral vascular to neurological vascular disorders womens contraceptive health varicose veins interventional oncology and cardiology procedures we were incorporated on january   in the state of nevada as big bear resources inc we changed our name to uranium plus resource corporation on march   on january   we completed the acquisition of all of the assets of artventive medical inc a california company and changed our name on january   to artventive medical group inc to concentrate on developing manufacturing and marketing the artventive eostm family of devices based on the work of dr leon rudakov phd and dr philippe gauilloud md we developed our first prototype of the artventive eostm in  since inception our activities have been focused on our corporate operations research and development eostm device design and testing implementation of quality controls and protocols animal studies and regulatory strategy for fda and european submissions and approvals in december  the company formally froze the eostm device design for the peripheral category of indications in preparation for the regulatory phase and prior to commercialization in europe followed by the united states we protect our technology with  approved patents and  patents pending we outsource certain operations to assist us in the implementation of our strategic plan to develop manufacture and commercialize our products these companies provided the following services � medical murray inc is our manufacturer and a leader in the field of medical device development and manufacturing that is iso certified and fda registered � alvamed inc formerly northwest clinical research group inc develops our regulatory and clinical strategy provides a platform of quality control and communicates with the fda and the european notified body in september of  we implemented our quality management system qms based on the requirements of the following regulations and international standards � us fda quality system regulation  cfr  � eu medical device directive mdd eec  � canada medical devices regulations cmdr sor � iso  medical devices  quality management systems  requirements regulatory purposes we completed a comprehensive iso certification audit performed by bsi product services bsi bsi is an international iso iso registrar and ce mark notified body required for the european regulatory approval and subsequent ce mark certification the audit confirmed that the companys document and quality control systems were up to iso standards and in compliance with international requirements for the maintaining quality of the products without nonconformities our common stock is currently listed on the otc market pink tier under the symbol avtd our product eostm is a minimally invasive occlusion device and procedure capable of achieving immediate complete and permanent occlusion of peripheral vasculature eostm is designed to be deployed into an artery vein or tube using our patented catheter and placed precisely in the correct location to cut off blood or fluid supply immediately completely and permanently the eostm delivery catheter is designed to permit fast and controlled deployment with instantaneous occlusion of the treated vessel making it safer and more effective than other treatment modalities the major advantage of the artventive eostm is its immediate action of occluding target sites most of all devices require much more time and radiation to perform the same type of procedure we received our ce mark certification for eostm on may   and implemented the planned eostm peripheral device transfer from research and development to commercialization marketing and exploratory distribution throughout europe simultaneous to making our us food and drug administration fda application the fda granted us k clearance for the following sizes of eostm as a therapy in patients with peripheral vasculature requiring occlusion fda k clearance granted productsize commercial introduction december   mm mm eos and guide catheter february  in  we commenced limited commercialization of our product targeting key hospitals in europe as proctoring centers we plan to expand our efforts in europe and the united states in  as well as expand the sizes of eostm to perform occlusions in a wider variety of vascular applications recent corporate developments since the commencement of the year through september   we have experienced the following corporate developments resignation of directors on april   the board of directors accepted the resignation of h james graham as executive chairman and a member of the board of directors effective may   on july   the board of directors accepted the resignation of christopher thorson as a member of the board of directors effective july   on may   the board of directors appointed tom brauser a member of the board of directors effective june   subsequent to that on august   the board of directors accepted mr brausers resignation from the board of directors of the company results of operations comparison of the three months ended september   to the three months ended september   revenue we recognize revenue via the sale of the eostm device to the companys distributors in europe and through direct sales in the us we invoice customers when products are shipped for the three months ended september   our total revenues were  as compared to  for the same period in  an increase of  the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to increased sales focus of the eostm device in the us which began just prior to the quarter ended september   expenses our expenses for the three months ended september   are summarized as follows in comparison to our expenses for the three months ended september   three months ended september    revenues     cost of sales   gross profit   research and development   selling general and administration   depreciation expense   financial expenses income net   net loss     research and development expenses three months ended september    salaries and related expenses    other research and development expenses   for the three months ended september   our gross profit was  based on both domestic and international sales including the cost of free demos for the three months ended september   our gross profit was zero since the volume of unit production was not enough to achieve profitable per unit costs of sales we expect manufacturing costs to decrease over the next twelve months with increased sales volume and the successful negotiation of a unit price cost from our manufacturing partner research and development costs decreased by  for the three months ended september   from the comparative period of  the decrease is due to our transitioning from the research and development stage of our product to the commercial stage we expect research and development costs to be ongoing due to the enhancement of current products and the development of new devices selling general and administrative expenses three months ended september    salaries and related expenses     stockbased compensation   professional fees   rent and related expenses   business development   other general and administrative expenses   total     for the three months ended september   selling general and administrative expenses decreased by  from the comparative period in  this was due in part to an effort by management to reduce certain general and administrative expenses and business development expenses professional fees decreased by  due primarily to efforts to reduce legal fees we anticipate continued professional fees mainly from regulatory legal and accounting due to ongoing public company reporting requirements business development expense decreased by  due to the companys efforts to reduce expenses and conserve cash including decreased participation in industry shows and conferences other general and administrative expenses increased by  due primarily to increased use of outside services and consultants comparison of the nine months ended september   to the nine months ended september   revenue for the nine months ended september   our total revenues were  as compared to  for the same period in  a decrease of  the decrease in revenue is attributable primarily to decreased sales of the eostm device to european distributors that was mainly due to a realignment of the companys sales strategy in the european market expenses our expenses for the nine months ended september   are summarized as follows in comparison to our expenses
