methods for using various forms of a novel receptor expressed by hematopoietic and endothelial cells an additional variant form of this receptor has been detected in brain cells and shown to bind to the obese gene product leptin therefore leptin may be used to stimulate the growth and development of receptorpositive hematopoietic and endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo in addition this receptor is selectively expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells with longterm repopulating potential thus agents that specifically bind to this receptor may be used to identify and isolate progenitor cells for a variety of clinical applications  background of the invention   hematopoietin receptor gene family  a variety of diseases including malignancy and immunodeficiency are related to malfunction within the lymphohematopoietic system some of these conditions could be alleviated andor cured by repopulating the hematopoietic system with progenitor cells which when triggered to differentiate would overcome the patients deficiency therefore the ability to initiate and regulate hematopoiesis is of great importance mccune et al  science   the process of blood cell formation by which a small number of selfrenewing stem cells give rise to lineage specific progenitor cells that subsequently undergo proliferation and differentiation to produce the mature circulating blood cells has been shown to be at least in part regulated by specific hormones these hormones are collectively known as hematopoietic growth factors or cytokines metcalf  science  dexter  j cell sci  golde and gasson  scientific american july tabbara and robinson  anticancer res  ogawa  environ health presp  dexter  br med bull   with the advent of recombinant dna technology the genes encoding a number of these molecules have now been molecularly cloned and expressed in recombinant form souza et al  science  gough et al  nature  yokota et al  proc natl acad sci usa  kawasaki et al  science  these cytokines have been studied in their structure biology and even therapeutic potential some of the most well characterized factors include erythropoietin epo stem cell factor scf granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor gmcsf macrophage colony stimulating factor mcsf granulocyte colony stimulating factor gcsf the interleukins il to il and thrombopoietin tpo  these cytokines act on different cell types at different stages during blood cell development and their potential uses in medicine are farreaching which include blood transfusions bone marrow transplantation correcting immunosuppressive disorders cancer therapy wound healing and activation of the immune response golde and gasson  scientific american july  apart from inducing proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells such cytokines have also been shown to activate a number of functions of mature blood cells stanley et al  j exp med  schrader et al  proc natl acad sci usa  moore et al

et al  j immunol   cytokines exert their effects on target cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors a number of cytokine receptors have been identified and the genes encoding them molecularly cloned several cytokine receptors have recently been classified into a hematopoietin receptor hr superfamily the grouping of these receptors was based on the conservation of key amino acid motifs in the extracellular domains bazan  immunology today  the hr family is defined by three conserved motifs in the extracellular domain of its members the first is a trpserxtrpser wsxws box motif which is highly conserved and located aminoterminal to the transmembrane domain most members of the hr family contain this motif the second consists of four conserved cysteine residues located in the aminoterminal half of the extracellular region the third is that both the conserved cysteines and the wsxws box are found within two separate conserved fibronectin type iii fn iii domains the members of the hr family include receptors for ligands such as epo gcsf fukunaga  cell  gmcsf il il il il il il βsubunit il il il and lif cosman  tibs   ligands for the hr are critically involved in the proliferation maturation and differentiation of blood cells for example il promotes the proliferation of early multilineage pluripotent stem cells and synergizes with epo to produce red cells il and il synergize to induce proliferation of early hematopoietic precursors gmcsf has been shown to induce the proliferation of granulocytes as well as increase macrophage function il is a bone marrowderived cytokine that plays a role in producing immature t and b lymphocytes il induces proliferation of antigenprimed b cells and antigenspecific t cells thus members of this receptor superfamily are involved in the regulation of the hematopoietic system   the obese gene gene product and its receptor  in order to study the molecular mechanism of weight regulation zhang et al  nature  cloned the mouse obese ob gene from obob mice which contain a single nucleotide mutation resulting in an obese phenotype when an isolated gene fragment was used as a probe it was shown to hybridize with rna only in white adipose tissue by northern blot analysis but not with rna in any other tissue in addition the coding sequence of the ob gene hybridized to all vertebrate genomic dnas tested indicating a high level of conservation of this molecule among vertebrates the deduced amino acid sequences are  identical between human and mouse and both molecules contain features of secreted proteins  in an effort to understand the physiologic function of the ob gene several independent research groups produced recombinant ob gene product in bacteria for in vivo testing pelleymounter et al  science  halaas et al  science  campfield et al  science  when the ob protein also known as leptin was injected into grossly obese mice which possessed two mutant copies of the ob gene the mice exhibited a reduced appetite and began to lose weight more importantly campfield et al  science  injected leptin directly into lateral ventricle and observed that the animals reduced their food intake suggesting that leptin acts on central neuronal networks to regulate feeding behavior and energy expenditure this result also provided evidence that leptinresponsive cells might reside in the brain  recently a leptin fusion protein was generated and used to screen for a leptin receptor obr in a cdna expression library prepared from mouse choroid plexus a tissue that lines brain cavities termed ventricles tartaglia et al  cell  this approach led to the cloning of one form of the obr coding sequence which reveals a single membranespanning receptor sharing structural similarities with several class i cytokine receptors such as the gp signaltransducing component of the il receptor taga et al  cell  the gcsf receptor fukunaga et al  cell  and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gearing et al  embo j  northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction rtpcr demonstrate that obr mrna is expressed in several tissues including lung kidney total brain and hypothalamus but there was no report on the expression of obr in hematopoietic tissues  the mouse obr isolated by tartaglia et al contains a relatively short intracellular cytoplasmic domain as compared with other class i cytokine receptors subsequently when its human homolog was isolated from a human infant brain library its predicted protein sequence contains a much longer intracellular domain in view of this finding it was speculated that different forms of the receptor might exist barinaga  science  however prior to the present invention no alternative forms of the obr had been identified  summary of the invention  the present invention relates to methods for using hub or obr variants as markers for the identification and isolation of progenitor cells in the hematopoietic and endothelial lineages and methods for using the ob gene and its gene product leptin to stimulate hematopoietic and endothelial development  the invention is based in part on the applicants discovery of three forms of a novel member of the hr family designated hub which have been isolated from a human fetal liver cdna library sequence comparison of these molecules with a human obr sequence tartaglia et al  cell  shows that they are nearly identical in their extracellular domains therefore these four molecules represent variant forms of the receptor that respond to leptin as a ligand while the three isoforms described herein differ from the reported obr protein at only three amino acid positions in the extracellular domain all four variants contain extensive differences in their intracellular domains at their ′ ends thus although these receptors bind to leptin they may transduce different signals upon ligand binding in addition hub is expressed in several cell lines of hematopoietic and endothelial origin tissue expression analysis demonstrates that fetal lung and liver also contain high levels of its mrna moreover human cd bone marrow cells express hub when mouse fetal liver cells are separated into several fractions based on their expression of aa and fcr the expression of the mouse homolog of hub is detected exclusively in the aafcr− population which has been shown to contain most if not all of the longterm repopulating hematopoietic progenitor cells at this stage of fetal liver development furthermore mouse bone marrow cells proliferate and differentiate in response to leptin stimulation by producing erythroid colonyforming units cfue erythroid burstforming units bfue and granulocytemacrophage cfugm colonies freshly isolated murine yolk sac cells also produce erythroid growth following leptin stimulation additionally hub is expressed in some endothelial cells and their precursors as they are derived from the embryonic yolk sac therefore hub is a marker for hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells  a wide variety of uses are encompassed in the present invention including but not limited to the use of hubspecific binding agents to identify and isolate hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells the use of leptin to activate such progenitor cells for in vitro or ex vivo expansion the use of leptin for in vivo stimulation of the same cell population in patients with immunodeficiency and anemia and the use of leptin to promote angiogenesis and vasculogenesis as well as augmentation of donor cell

novel hematopoietic progenitor cell marker and its use for cell identification and isolation as well as the use of leptin to stimulate hematopoietic and endothelial development via this receptor known as hub in a specific embodiment by way of example in section  infra several forms of this receptor were cloned and characterized amino acid sequence comparison of these related molecules with a published human obr sequence tartaglia et al  cell  reveals only three amino acid differences in their extracellular domains but extensive diversity in their intracellular cytoplasmic domains more specifically figs ag shows that in the hub molecules described herein nucleotide residues  encode alanine nucleotide residues  encode arginine and nucleotide residues  encode arginine additionally the four forms diverge both in length and sequence composition from nucleotide residue  and beyond in this regard the intracellular domain of form  of hub described herein is highly homologous to a retrotransposon sequence ono et al  nucl acid res   analysis of the hub variants reveals significant homology to the fn iii domain of the hr family indicating that they belong to the hr family of receptors northern blot hybridization and rtpcr analyses indicates that hub mrna is highly expressed in cells of hematopoietic and endothelial origin in addition the hub sequence is expressed in certain fetal tissues and tumor cell lines hence in addition to its expression in the brain for weight regulation by leptin hub or obr is expressed by hematopoietic and endothelial cells thereby rendering these cells responsive to the action of leptin  since additional variant forms of the molecule may exist they can be identified by labeled dna probes made from nucleic acid fragments corresponding to any portion of the cdna disclosed herein in a cdna library prepared from human fetal liver human lung human kidney human choroid plexus human hypothalamus human prostate and human ovary more specifically oligonucleotides corresponding to either the ′ or ′ terminus of the cdna sequence may be used to obtain longer nucleotide sequences briefly the library may be plated out to yield a maximum of  pfu for each  mm plate approximately  plates may be screened the plates are incubated at ° c until the plaques reach a diameter of  mm or are just beginning to make contact with one another  hours nylon filters are placed onto the soft top agarose and after  seconds the filters are peeled off and floated on a dna denaturing solution consisting of n sodium hydroxide the filters are then immersed in neutralizing solution consisting of m tris hcl ph  before being allowed to air dry the filters are prehybridized in casein hybridization buffer containing  dextran sulfate m nacl  mm tris hcl ph   sodium pyrophosphate  casein  sds and denatured salmon sperm dna at  mgml for  hours at ° c the radiolabelled probe is then denatured by heating to ° c for  minutes and then added to the prehybridization solution containing the filters the filters are hybridized at ° c for  hours the filters are then washed in × wash mix × wash mix contains m nacl m tris base and m edta twice for  minutes each at room temperature then in × wash mix containing  sds at ° c for  minutes and finally in × wash mix containing  sds at ° c for  minutes the filters are then air dried and exposed to xray film for autoradiography after developing the film is aligned with the filters to select a positive plaque if a single isolated positive plaque cannot be obtained the agar plug containing the plaques will be removed and placed in lambda dilution buffer containing m nacl m magnesium sulfate m tris hcl ph   gelatin the phage may then be replated and rescreened to obtain single well isolated positive plaques positive plaques may be isolated and the cdna clones sequenced using primers based on the known cdna sequence this step may be repeated until a full length cdna is obtained  one method for identifying all ′ isoforms is to pcr amplify the ′ ends of the variant cdna from a variety of tissues including but not limiting to choroid plexus hypothalamus fetal liver bone marrow ovary or prostate to obtain the ′ end of the cdna an oligodt primer is used to synthesize the cdna first strand hub specific primers from the conserved region of the gene eg up stream of nucleotide  and oligodt are then used to amplify the ′ end the pcr fragments are cloned and sequenced by standard techniques once obtained these sequences may be translated into amino acid sequence and examined for certain landmarks such as continuous open reading frame regulatory regions that associate with tyrosine kinase activation and finally overall structural similarity to known variants   hub as a progenitor cell marker  hub is expressed in cells of hematopoietic and endothelial origin in a specific embodiment by way of example in section  infra hub is expressed in early progenitor cells and in a small percentage of progenitors with longterm repopulating potential in order to utilize hub receptor as a marker for cell identification and isolation specific binding agents such as antibodies may be generated to the protein   generation of antibodies  various procedures known in the art may be used for the production of antibodies to epitopes of natural or recombinant hub receptor such antibodies include but are not limited to polyclonal monoclonal chimeric single chain fab fragments and fragments produced by an fab expression library neutralizing antibodies ie those which compete for the ligand binding site of the receptor are especially preferred for diagnostics and therapeutics  monoclonal antibodies that bind hub may be radioactively labeled allowing one to follow their location and distribution in the body after injection radioisotope tagged antibodies may be used as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for imaging de novo cells of tumors and metastases as well as fetal tissues  immunotoxins may also be designed which target cytotoxic agents to specific sites in the body for example high affinity hub specific monoclonal antibodies may be covalently complexed to bacterial or plant toxins such as diphtheria toxin or ricin a general method of preparation of antibodyhybrid molecules may involve use of thiolcrosslinking reagents such as spdp which attack the primary amino groups on the antibody and by disulfide exchange attach the toxin to the antibody the hybrid antibodies may be used to specifically eliminate hub expressing tumor cells  for the production of antibodies various host animals may be immunized by injection with the hub protein fragments thereof or synthetic peptides including but not limited to rabbits mice rats hamsters etc various adjuvants may be used to increase the immunological response depending on the host species including but not limited to freunds complete and incomplete mineral gels such as aluminum hydroxide surface active substances such as lysolecithin pluronic polyols polyanions peptides oil emulsions keyhole limpet hemocyanin dinitrophenol and potentially useful human adjuvants such as bcg bacilli calmetteguerin and corynebacterium parvum  monoclonal antibodies to hub may be prepared by using any technique which provides for the production of antibody molecules by continuous cell lines in culture these include but are not limited to the hybridoma technique originally described by kohler and milstein nature   the human bcell hybridoma technique kosbor et al  immunology today  cote et al  proc natl acad sci  and the ebvhybridoma technique cole et al  monoclonal antibodies and cancer therapy alan r liss inc pp  in addition techniques developed for the production of “chimeric antibodies” morrison et al  proc natl acad sci  neuberger et al  nature  takeda et al  nature  by splicing the genes from a mouse antibody molecule of appropriate antigen specificity together with genes from a human antibody molecule of appropriate biological activity can be used alternatively techniques described for the production of single chain antibodies us pat no  can be adapted to produce hubspecific single chain antibodies  antibody fragments which contain specific binding sites of hub may be generated by known techniques for example such fragments include but are not limited to the fab′ fragments which can be produced by pepsin digestion of the antibody molecule and the fab fragments which can be generated by reducing the disulfide bridges of the fab′ fragments alternatively fab expression libraries may be constructed huse et al  science  to allow rapid and easy identification of monoclonal fab fragments with the desired specificity to hub   progenitor cell separation  human hematopoietic progenitor cells may be isolated using an antibody to hub protein a leptin ligand a leptin peptide containing the receptorbinding domain or a leptin fusion protein using conventional cell separation methods well known in the art such hubspecific binding agents may be used in combination with other agents such as anticd antibodies  although bone marrow is the preferred cell source other physiologic sources of hematopoietic cells may be utilized for example the spleen thymus peripheral blood cytokinemobilized blood umbilical cord blood embryonic yolk sac or fetal liver bone marrow is preferably removed from the iliac crest but may also be removed from other bone cavity bone marrow may be removed from bone cavity by various methods well known to those skilled in the art including flushing the bone with a mixture of physiological media balanced salt solution physiological buffer and other naturally occurring factors typically the bone marrow is filtered centrifuged and resuspended  once a source of hematopoietic cells is obtained hematopoietic progenitor cells may be separated from the cell mixture by various methods which utilize an agent such as a specific antibody or a leptin ligand which specifically binds to cell surface hubencoded receptor protein these techniques may include for example flow cytometry using a fluorescence activated cell sorter facs and specific fluorochromes biotinavidin or biotinstreptavidin separations using biotin conjugated to cell surface markerspecific antibodies and avidin or streptavidin bound to a solid support such as affinity column matrix or plastic surfaces magnetic separations using antibodycoated magnetic beads destructive separations such as antibody and complement or antibody bound to cytotoxins or radioactive isotopes  separation of a cell mixture via antibodies may be performed by negative or positive selection procedures in negative separation antibodies are used which are specific for markers present on undesired hematopoietic cells cells bound by an antibody may be removed or lysed and the remaining desired mixture retained in positive separation antibodies specific for hub or leptin ligand may be used cells bound by the antibody or leptin are separated and retained it will be understood that positive and negative separations may be used substantially simultaneously or in a sequential manner it will also be understood that the present invention encompasses any separation technique which can isolate cells based on the expression of hub as disclosed herein for example a cell mixture may be separated into cd and cd− fractions first followed by hubspecific separation  at present the most common technique for antibodybased separation has been the use of flow cytometry such as by a facs typically separation by flow cytometry is performed as follows the suspended mixture of hematopoietic cells are centrifuged and resuspended in media antibodies which are conjugated to fluorochrome are added to allow the binding of the antibodies to specific cell surface markers the cell mixture is then washed by one or more centrifugation and resuspension steps the mixture is run through facs which separates the cells based on different fluorescence characteristics facs systems are available in varying levels of performance and ability including multicolor analysis the cells can be identified by a characteristic profile of forward and side scatter which is influenced by size and granularity as well as by positive andor negative expression of certain cell surface markers  other separation techniques besides flow cytometry may provide for faster separations one such method is biotinavidin based separation by affinity chromatography typically such a technique is performed by incubating the washed hematopoietic cells with biotincoupled leptin or antibodies to specific markers followed by passage through an avidin column biotinantibodycell or biotinleptincell complexes bind to the column via the biotinavidin interaction while other cells pass through the column finally the columnbound cells may be released by perturbation or other methods the specificity of the biotinavidin system is well suited for rapid positive separation  flow cytometry and biotinavidin techniques provide highly specific means of cell separation if desired a separation may be initiated by less specific techniques which however can remove a large proportion of mature blood cells from the hematopoietic cell source for example magnetic bead separations may be used to initially remove differentiated hematopoietic cell populations including tcells bcells natural killer nk cells and macrophages as well as minor cell populations including megakaryocytes mast cells eosinophils and basophils desirably at least about  and usually at least about  of the total hematopoietic cells present can be removed  a preferred initial separation technique is densitygradient separation here the bone marrow or other hematopoietic cell mixture preparation is centrifuged and the supernatant removed the cells are resuspended in for example rpmi  medium gibco with  fcs and placed in a density gradient prepared with for example “ficoll” or “percoll” or “eurocollins” media the separation may then be performed by centrifugation or automatically with a cobel  cell separator  cobev lakewood colo additional separation procedures may be desirable depending on the source of the hematopoietic cell mixture and its content for example if blood is used as a source of hematopoietic cells it may be desirable to lyse red blood cells prior to the separation of any fraction furthermore elutriation may also be used alone or in combination with all of other purification procedures described herein noga et al  prog clin biol res  noga et al  prog clin biol res    the obese gene product leptin  the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of both human and mouse leptin have been published recently by zhang et al  nature  thereafter the mouse coding sequence was used to express functional leptin in e coli pelleymounter et al  science  halaas et al  science  campfield et al  science  furthermore human leptin was also expressed and shown to be biologically active in murine experiments halaas et al  science  hence human murine and homologous coding sequences from other species may be expressed and the recombinant protein purified by conventional techniques such as affinity chromatography with an antibody alternatively natural protein may be directly purified from cells that secrete leptin such as adipose cell lines   expression of leptin protein  for the practice of the present invention human and mouse leptin polynucleotide sequences which encode the proteins peptide fragments fusion proteins or functional equivalents thereof may be used to generate recombinant dna molecules that direct their expression in appropriate host cells  due to the inherent degeneracy of the genetic code other dna sequences which encode substantially the same or a functionally equivalent amino acid sequence may be used in the practice of the invention for the cloning and expression of the leptin protein in particular such dna sequences include those which are capable of hybridizing to the human leptin sequences under stringent conditions  altered dna sequences which may be used in accordance with the invention include deletions additions or substitutions of different nucleotide residues resulting in a sequence that encodes the same or a functionally equivalent gene product the gene product itself may contain deletions additions or substitutions of amino acid residues within a coding sequence which result in a silent change thus producing a functionally equivalent leptin protein such amino acid substitutions may be made on the basis of similarity in polarity charge solubility hydrophobicity hydrophilicity andor the amphipathic nature of the residues involved for example negatively charged amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamic acid positively charged amino acids include lysine histidine and arginine amino acids with uncharged polar head groups having similar hydrophilicity values include the following glycine asparagine glutamine serine threonine tyrosine and amino acids with nonpolar head groups include alanine valine isoleucine leucine phenylalanine proline methionine tryptophan  the dna sequences of leptin may be engineered in order to alter the coding sequence for a variety of ends including but not limited to alterations which modify processing and expression of the gene product for example mutations may be introduced using techniques which are well known in the art eg sitedirected mutagenesis to insert new restriction sites to alter glycosylation patterns phosphorylation etc  in another embodiment of the invention a leptin or a modified leptin sequence may be ligated to a heterologous sequence to encode a fusion protein it may also be useful to encode a chimeric leptin protein expressing a heterologous epitope that is recognized by a commercially available antibody a fusion protein may also be engineered to contain a cleavage site located between a leptin sequence and the heterologous protein sequence so that the leptin protein may be cleaved away from the heterologous moiety  in an alternate embodiment of the invention the coding sequence of leptin could be synthesized in whole or in part using chemical methods well known in the art see for example caruthers et al  nuc acids res symp ser  crea and horn  nuc acids res  matteucci and caruthers  tetrahedron letters  and chow and kempe  nuc acids res  alternatively the protein itself could be produced using chemical methods to synthesize leptin amino acid sequence in whole or in part for example peptides can be synthesized by solid phase techniques cleaved from the resin and purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography eg see creighton  proteins structures and molecular principles wh freeman and co ny pp  the composition of the synthetic peptides may be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing eg the edman degradation procedure see creighton  proteins structures and molecular principles wh freeman and co ny pp   in order to express a biologically active leptin protein the nucleotide sequence coding for leptin or a functional equivalent is inserted into an appropriate expression vector ie a vector which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and translation of the inserted coding sequence the leptin gene products as well as host cells or cell lines transfected or transformed with recombinant leptin expression vectors can be used for a variety of purposes   expression systems for leptin  methods which are well known to those skilled in the art can be used to construct expression vectors containing the leptin coding sequence and appropriate transcriptionaltranslational control signals these methods include in vitro recombinant dna techniques synthetic techniques and in vivo recombinationgenetic recombination see for example the techniques described in sambrook et al  molecular cloning a laboratory manual cold spring harbor laboratory ny and ausubel et al  current protocols in molecular biology greene publishing associates and wiley interscience ny  a variety of hostexpression vector systems may be utilized to express the leptin coding sequence these include but are not limited to microorganisms such as bacteria transformed with recombinant bacteriophage dna plasmid dna or cosmid dna expression vectors containing the leptin coding sequence yeast transformed with recombinant yeast expression vectors containing the leptin coding sequence insect cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors eg baculovirus containing the leptin coding sequence plant cell systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors eg cauliflower mosaic virus camv tobacco mosaic virus tmv or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors eg ti plasmid containing the leptin coding sequence or animal cell systems  the expression elements of these systems vary in their strength and specificities depending on the hostvector system utilized any of a number of suitable transcription and translation elements including constitutive and inducible promoters may be used in the expression vector for example when cloning in bacterial systems inducible promoters such as pl of bacteriophage x plac ptrp ptac ptrplac hybrid promoter and the like may be used when cloning in insect cell systems promoters such as the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter may be used when cloning in plant cell systems promoters derived from the genome of plant cells eg heat shock promoters the promoter for the small subunit of rubisco the promoter for the chlorophyll αβ binding protein or from plant viruses eg the s rna promoter of camv the coat protein promoter of tmv may be used when cloning in mammalian cell systems promoters derived from the genome of mammalian cells eg metallothionein promoter or from mammalian viruses eg the adenovirus late promoter the vaccinia virus k promoter may be used when generating cell lines that contain multiple copies of the leptin dna sv bpv and ebvbased vectors may be used with an appropriate selectable marker  in bacterial systems a number of expression vectors may be advantageously selected depending upon the use intended for the leptin expressed for example when large quantities of leptin are to be produced for the generation of antibodies or to screen peptide libraries vectors which direct the expression of high levels of fusion protein products that are readily purified may be desirable such vectors include but are not limited to the e coli expression vector pur ruther et al  embo j  in which the leptin coding sequence may be ligated into the vector in frame with the lac z coding region so that a hybrid aslac z protein is produced pin vectors inouye  inouye  nucleic acids res  van heeke  schuster  j biol chem  and the like pgex vectors may also be used to express foreign polypeptides as fusion proteins with glutathione stransferase gst in general such fusion proteins are soluble and can easily be purified from lysed cells by adsorption to glutathioneagarose beads followed by elution in the presence of free glutathione the pgex vectors are designed to include thrombin or factor xa protease cleavage sites so that the cloned polypeptide of interest can be released from the gst moiety  in yeast a number of vectors containing constitutive or inducible

expression of the leptin coding sequence may be driven by any of a number of promoters for example viral promoters such as the s rna and s rna promoters of camv brisson et al  nature  or the coat protein promoter of tmv takamatsu et al  embo j  may be used alternatively plant promoters such as the small subunit of rubisco coruzzi et al  embo j  broglie et al  science  or heat shock promoters eg soybean hspe or hspb gurley et al  mol cell biol  may be used these constructs can be introduced into plant cells using ti plasmids ri plasmids plant virus vectors direct dna transformation

plant molecular biology d ed blackie london ch   an alternative expression system which could be used to express leptin is an insect system in one such system autographa californica nuclear polyhidrosis virus acnpv is used as a vector to express foreign genes the virus grows in spodoptera frugiperda cells the leptin coding sequence may be cloned into nonessential regions for example the polyhedrin gene of the virus and placed under control of an acnpv promoter for example the polyhedrin promoter successful insertion of the leptin coding sequence will result in inactivation of the polyhedrin gene and production of nonoccluded recombinant virus ie virus lacking the proteinaceous coat coded for by the polyhedrin gene these recombinant viruses are then used to infect spodoptera frugiperda cells in which the inserted gene is expressed eg see smith et al  j virol  smith us pat no   in mammalian host cells a number of viral based expression systems may be utilized in cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector the leptin coding sequence may be ligated to an adenovirus transcriptiontranslation control complex eg the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence this chimeric gene may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination insertion in a nonessential region of the viral genome eg region e or e will result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing leptin in infected hosts eg see logan  shenk  proc natl acad sci usa  alternatively the vaccinia k promoter may be used see eg mackett et al  proc natl acad sci usa  mackett et al  j virol  panicali et al  proc natl acad sci usa   specific initiation signals may also be required for efficient translation of inserted leptin coding sequences these signals include the atg initiation codon and adjacent sequences in cases where the entire leptin gene including its own initiation codon and adjacent sequences is inserted into the appropriate expression vector no additional translational control signals may be needed however in cases where only a portion of the leptin coding sequence is inserted exogenous translational control signals including the atg initiation codon must be provided furthermore the initiation codon must be in phase with the reading frame of the leptin coding sequence to ensure translation of the entire insert these exogenous translational control signals and initiation codons can be of a variety of origins both natural and synthetic the efficiency of expression may be enhanced by the inclusion of appropriate transcription enhancer elements transcription terminators etc see bittner et al  methods in enzymol   in addition a host cell strain may be chosen which modulates the expression of the inserted sequences or modifies and processes the gene product in the specific fashion desired such modifications eg glycosylation and processing eg cleavage of protein products may be important for the function of the protein the presence of several consensus nglycosylation sites in leptin support the possibility that proper modification may be important for leptin function different host cells have characteristic and specific mechanisms for the posttranslational processing and modification of proteins appropriate cell lines or host systems can be chosen to ensure the correct modification and processing of the foreign protein expressed to this end eukaryotic host cells which possess the cellular machinery for proper processing of the primary transcript glycosylation and phosphorylation of the gene product may be used such mammalian host cells include but are not limited to cho vero bhk hela cos mdck  wi etc  for longterm highyield production of recombinant proteins stable expression is preferred for example cell lines which stably express the leptin sequence may be engineered rather than using expression vectors which contain viral origins of replication host cells can be transformed with the leptin dna controlled by appropriate expression control elements eg promoter enhancer sequences transcription terminators polyadenylation sites etc and a selectable marker following the introduction of foreign dna engineered cells may be allowed to grow for  days in an enriched media and then are switched to a selective media the selectable marker in the recombinant plasmid confers resistance to the selection and allows cells to stably integrate the plasmid into their chromosomes and grow to form foci which in turn can be cloned and expanded into cell lines  a number of selection systems may be used including but not limited to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase wigler et al  cell  hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase szybalska  szybalski

communications in molecular biology cold spring harbor laboratory ed  once the leptin protein is expressed by any of the aforementioned systems supernatants of the cultured cells or cell lysates may be subjected to various standard methods of protein purification for example an antileptin antibody or hub protein can be used to purify it by affinity chromatography alternatively leptin may be purified by ion exchange chromatography or hplc thereafter the purity of the protein can be confirmed by various methods including sdspage and the protein used immediately or stored frozen for future use for cell cultures and in vivo administration purified leptin must be sterilized prior to use   activation of hubexpressing cells by leptin  since various forms of hub including obr are essentially identical in the extracellular domain these receptors can bind leptin as a ligand in order to compare the binding affinity of hub isoforms to leptin the variant forms are cloned into standard expression vectors eg cmv promoter expression vectors and transfected into cos and baf cells surface expression of the receptor is then evaluated by direct binding to an antihub antibody in addition leptin binding assays can also be performed as described by tartaglia et al  cell  using a leptin fusion protein or soluble leptin conjugated to a radiolabel a fluorescent dye or an enzyme the results are compared with mock transfected cells as negative controls  since the four variants of hub contain different intracellular domains these isoforms can be compared with respect to their signal transduction capabilities to determine the most active form stimulation of most if not all hematopoietic receptors with ligands results in the rapid phosphorylation of tyrosines both on the receptors and on a cascade of cellular protein kinases heidin  cell  ihle  nature  phosphorylation of these molecules results in an activation signal being propagated ultimately to the nucleus leading to gene activation upon ligand binding to an hematopoietin receptor some of the first molecules to be activated in this fashion are the jak janus family of protein kinases ziemiecki et al  trends cell biol  these activated kinases in turn phosphorylate members of the stat family of molecules which eventually translocate to the nucleus and form active transcription complexes darnell et al  science  zhong

cd bone marrow and cord blood for the murine experiments three primitive populations can be evaluated eg ly lineage negative bone marrow or the equivalent in fetal liver or aa fetal liver  while tyrosine phosphorylation is an indication of cell activation resulting from ligandreceptor interactions additional manifestations of activation at the cellular level can be assayed by using leptin to induce the proliferation andor differentiation of hematopoietic precursors cell proliferation can be easily assessed by hthymidine uptake or by visual enumeration of cell numbers differentiation of hematopoietic cells can be assayed by testing the ability of leptin to stimulate the in vitro growth and differentiation of various hematopoietic colonies for example a cell mixture can be isolated from the yolk sac fetal liver or bone marrow and cultured in standard methylcellulose colony assays with and without serum supplements in the presence of leptin  nm with or without various other cytokines metcalf  in clonal culture of hematopoietic cells techniques and applications elsevier ny  a standard protocol for such an assay involves density gradient centrifugation of a cell mixture by

elsevier ny freshney  in culture of hematopoietic cells wileyliss inc pp  optimal concentrations of leptin in this assay may increase both the size and the frequency of these primitive pluripotent colonies  while leptin may be used alone it can also be used  synergistically with several cytokines to promote hematopoietic cell growth including but not limited to il il il epo steel factor scf and gmcsf  ngml in addition since biologically active leptin is present in fetal calf serum fcs cultures with  of fcs can be  tested the specific activity of leptin in fcs can be inhibited by an antileptin antibody or a soluble variant of hub as a control  in particular the effects of leptin may be tested on the primitive precursors that form high proliferative potential cells hppc mcniece

even more primitive cells in these assays cd bone marrow cord blood and fetal liver cells can be first sorted by an antibody and tested in the above assays since recent evidence has suggested the existence of a cd− stem cell the cd− lin− population may also be stimulated by leptin  furthermore the effect of leptin on the primitive long term culture initiating cells ltcic and on hematopoietic

the competitive repopulation assay harrison  blood  this assay allows for the quantification of hematopoietic stem cells  additionally since endothelial cells also express hub leptin may be used to stimulate the growth of primary endothelial cells at  nm in standard cultures for maintaining primary endothelial cells masek and sweetenham  br j haematol  visner et al  am j physiol l moyer et al

growth factor fgf transforming growth factor tgf and epidermal growth factor egf are harvested and tested as a supplement in the hematopoietic colony assays above  in another aspect of the invention since receptors often form dimers on the cell surface the combination of different hub isoforms that give optimal signal transduction can be measured by growth stimulation and phosphorylation patterns a hubgrowth factordependent indicator cell line eg baf can be transfected with various combinations of the isoforms using standard cmv expression vectors following the demonstration of cell surface expression leptin  nm is added to the cultures followed by the measurement of growth rates and phosphorylation patterns by established techniques other cell lines such as tf fd and ts may also be used  because of the expression of isoforms with truncated cytoplasmic tails it is possible that another protein chain is used in some tissues as the signaling molecule in association with hub such a molecule can be screened and selected by transfecting pools of cdna from expression libraries of a variety of tissues eg fetal liver cdbone marrow lung ovary etc together with constructs expressing one of the truncated hub isoforms into a growth factordependent cell line eg baf the ability to grow in the presence of leptin is used as a readout in particular the insulin receptorrelated receptor zhang and roth  j biol chem  the lifra ilry ilrα mosely et al  cell  and ilra chains hilton et al  proc natl acad sci usa  may function as complementary chains for hub activity the techniques to identify the unique cdna responsible for this complementation are well established in the art  additionally agents that activate hub in a manner similar to leptin may also be used in place of leptin these agents include small molecules and peptides and they may be selected in the following screening assay ten thousand baf and bafhub transfectant cells that express the full length hub isoform cells will be screened in microtiter plates for proliferative effects after incubation with a test agent without stimulation these cells die any growth promoting effect seen on the transfected cell line and not with the baf host would indicate that the test agent specifically activates the hub receptor or its signaling pathway this assay is used to screen small molecules including peptides oligonucleotides and chemical libraries   in vitro uses of leptin  in view of the expression of hub in diverse cell types leptin may be used to activate these cells in culture the activated cells expand in number due to increased proliferation andor differentiate to become more mature cells in this connection the optimal effective concentration of leptin for each cell type may be determined by conventional titration experiments in which different amounts of leptin are incubated with the specific cells and their activation levels measured by tyrosine phosphorylation proliferation or differentiation  in particular hematopoietic progenitor cells express hub hematopoietic cells may be activated by exposure to leptin in vitro which results in their expansion in number prior to their use in vitro and in vivo such hematopoietic cells may be obtained from the bone marrow the peripheral blood demuynck et al  ann hematol  scheding et al  stem cells suppl  and cord blood in order to selectively enhance the growth of hematopoietic stem cells the donor cell mixture may be first separated into cd cells followed by leptin stimulation the expanded cells may be used as donor cells in bone marrow transplantation or as longterm bone marrow cultures ponchio et al  blood  testa and dexter  curr opin  naughton and naughton  us pat no  for in vitro cytotoxicity testing and the discovery of novel cytokines  since hub is also expressed in some endothelial cells and their progenitors leptin may be used to induce blood vessel formation in vitro in that regard leptin may be used alone or in combination with vegf pdgf fgf or tgfα blood vessels form by a combination of two primary processes some blood vessel growth depends on angiogenesis in a process similar to that associated with pathological conditions for instance the cns depends solely on angiogenesis for development of its vascular supply nodew  am rev respir dis  risau et al  embo j  a second process vasculogenesis depends on the incorporation of migratory individual endothelial cells angioblasts into the developing blood vessel leptin may be used to promote both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis  in addition the coding sequence of leptin may be inserted in an expression vector in accordance with section  supra and transferred into leptinnonproducing cell types to result in endogenous expression of leptin for example hematopoietic stem cells are isolated and transfected with the leptin coding sequence thereafter the cells are transferred into a bone marrow transplant recipient to cause endogenous production of leptin in stimulating hematopoiesis us pat no    in vivo uses of leptin  the appropriate dosage and formulation of leptin on human hematopoietic and endothelial development in vivo can be first determined in animal models for example normal mice may be lethally irradiated or chemically ablated and reconstituted with syngeneic or allogeneic bone marrow since recombinant human leptin has been shown to be active on mouse cells the rate of donor cell engraftment can be compared between leptintreated and nontreated groups because of the hub expression on primitive hematopoietic cells leptin facilitates the growth and recovery of these cells in the recipient the effect of leptin on in vivo hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation in these situations can be evaluated by reconstituting lethally irradiating mice r with normal bone marrow cells × per mouse groups of animals are given pbs injections as controls and other groups receive leptin  mgkg at varying intervals the activity of leptin is assayed by the rapidity of renormalization and stability of blood profiles eg hematocrit wbc count differential etc  in addition neonatal sublethally irradiated adult normal or scid mice can be reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cell isolated from bone marrow cord blood or fractions thereof in these mice the human hematopoietic cells engraft and differentiate mccune et al  science  sandhu et al  j immunol  the effects of leptin can be evaluated by measuring the growth rate and extent of differentiation of human cells in these animals  an effective amount of leptin may be administered into a patient who is in need of increased hematopoietic cell function such a need may arise from various forms of immunodeficiencies b cell deficiencies t cell deficiencies and combined deficiencies myelosuppression anemias and cancer in these cases leptin may be used alone or in combination with other cytokines additionally since certain tumor cells such as leukemic cells express hub leptin may be used therapeutically to suppress tumor growth by inducing terminal differentiation of these cells alternatively leptin may be conjugated to a growth inhibitory agent such as ricin diphtheria toxin or a chemotherapeutic drug to specifically target and destroy tumor cells furthermore antagonists of leptin eg a modified leptin molecule or a fragment thereof that binds to its receptor but does not trigger signal transduction may be used to block the stimulatory effects of leptin in cases where naturally occurring leptin stimulates tumor growth in vivo  additionally the leptin coding sequence may be inserted in a viral vector for use in gene therapy jolly  cancer gene therapy  in particular retrovirus adenovirus vaccinia virus and adenoassociated viruses are preferred the leptin coding sequencecarrying virus is injected into a patient to directly supply leptin by secretion into the bloodstream or to a specific target tissue   dosage determination  the leptin protein and nucleic acid sequences described herein can be administered to a patient at therapeutically effective doses to treat or ameliorate various hematologic disorders and deficiencies a therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the protein sufficient to result in amelioration of symptoms of the disorder or alternatively to that amount of a nucleic acid sequence sufficient to express a concentration of gene product which results in the amelioration of the disorder  toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of leptin can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals eg for determining the ld the dose lethal to  of the population and the ed the dose therapeutically effective in  of the population the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio lded purified leptin which exhibits large therapeutic indices is preferred while leptin preparations that exhibit toxic side effects may be used care should be taken to design a delivery system that targets such preparations to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize potential damage to normal cells and thereby reduce side effects  the data obtained from the cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans the dosage of leptin lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ed with little or no toxicity the dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized a dose may be formulated in animal models to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that includes the ic ie the concentration of leptin which achieves a halfmaximal inhibition of symptoms as determined in cell culture such information can be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans levels in plasma may be measured for

were isolated from a human fetal liver cdna library clontech palo alto calif and the dna sequences of several of these clones were determined these clones designated hub            contained overlapping sequences which were then compiled into a contiguous nucleotide sequence both the nucleotide sequence and the predicted protein sequence from one such cdna are shown in figs ag this cdna sequence contains two fn iii domains each containing a “ws box” which are characteristic of genes of the hr family thus this cdna represents a novel member of the hr gene family herein referred to as hub table  based on the sequence of hub presented in figs ag the translation initiation site appears at position  the sequence encodes an open reading frame up to and including nucleotide  it is believed that the sequence from about nucleotide  to about  encodes a transmembrane domain the complete sequence encodes a protein of  amino acids  subsequent amino acid sequence comparison of this molecule with other published protein sequences revealed that it was highly homologous to a recently published human obr protein tartaglia  cell  in this connection the sequence of hub shown in figs ag differs from the published human obr sequence only at three nucleotide positions in the extracellular domain ie nucleotide residues   and  resulting in amino acids alanine arginine and arginine respectively in hub protein the two molecules are identical in the transmembrane region and a portion of the intracellular domain up to and including nucleotide  then they diverge at nucleotide  and

sequence in figs ag referred to as form  of hub and the variant form reported to be obr other lambda clones were discovered that contained different sequences from form  near the ′ end known as form  and form  all three forms contain the identical sequence up to and including nucleotide  then they diverge at nucleotide  and beyond fig  an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of all three forms and the obr is shown in figs af two of the originally isolated lambda clones  and  contain the ′ end sequences of form  and form  respectively the different forms of hub may derive from a common precursor mrna by an alternative splicing mechanism the sequence in this region is consistent with well known splice junctions it is noteworthy that the dna sequence of form  from nucleotide  to the end is  identical to a human retrotransposon sequence that is thought to be derived from a human endogenous retroviral dna sequence singer  cell  weiner et al  ann rev biochem  lower et al  proc natl acad sci usa  ono et al  nucl acid res   in view of the foregoing the recently published human obr by tartaglia  cell  represents a fourth form of hub because of its structural similarities to the aforementioned three forms figs af although there are three amino acid substitutions in the obr such differences may have resulted from allelic disparities between genetically diverse individuals it is also possible that the three forms of the receptor described herein are specific isoforms in fetal and hematopoietic cells while the obr is expressed in the brain the differences in their intracellular domains may be involved in the different signalling pathways used by these receptor variants in different cells  in order to examine the expression of the variant forms of cdna rtpcr was performed using several human cell lines the results in table  show that form  was expressed as rna in k cells and in a human fetal liver cdna preparation since hub was cloned from human fetal liver cdna library this served as a positive control however with respect to several other human cell lines form  was not detected whereas hub expression was positive for example form  was not expressed in kgla cells but form  was expressed thus it is possible that different forms of hub are not expressed simultaneously in the same cells there may be selective expression of certain forms in particular cell populations additionally table  shows expression of hub in cell lines of diverse origins including hematopoietic endothelial central nervous system cns breast and muscle it is interesting to note that the variant hub reported to be obr is also detected in these cells particularly in hematopoietic cell lines hel and k table  table rtpcr analysis ofcomparative expression of two hub formscell

human tissue rna were probed with a radiolabelled hub fragment corresponding to nucleotide numbers from  to  as disclosed in figs ag for northern blot analyses two different size mrnas were detected this result suggests that there may be another homologous gene or there is alternative splicing of a single rna transcript hub expression was by far the strongest in human fetal tissues particularly the liver and lung trace levels were found in several adult tissues interestingly a chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line k table  was strongly positive for its expression while some expression was

blood−leukocytescancerhl−hela−kmolt−raji−sw−ag−  taken together the data indicates that the hub represents a new member of the human hematopoietin receptor family it was originally cloned from a hematopoietic tissue fetal liver it is expressed by certain fetal tissues and shares structural homology with several receptors which interact with ligands capable of influencing hematopoietic development in this regard it shares certain sequence homology with the ilr ilr gcsfr ilr beta chain gp ilr and lifr it contains two “ws box” motifs with the correct spacing of conserved amino acids in the fn iii domains an amphipathic sequence in block  of the fn iii domains and alternating hydrophobic and basic amino acids in block  of the fn iii domains it also contains conserved cysteines in the cysteine rich regions upstream of the fn iii domains  despite its structural similarities with receptors expressed by hematopoietic cells the extracellular domain of hub is nearly identical to that of the human obr expressed in the brain in fact since three variant forms of hub have been isolated which show extensive sequence diversity primarily in their intracellular cytoplasmic domains obr may be considered an additional isoform of the same receptor the data presented in table  further confirm that the obr is expressed not only in cells of the brain but also in hematopoietic and endothelial cells therefore since leptin binds to obr it is also a ligand that can trigger hub activation in hematopoietic and endothelial cells that express these receptor variants  example hub is expressed by longterm repopulating hematopoietic progenitor cells   materials and methods   rna extraction and cdna synthesis  total rna was extracted using the recommended procedure for rnazol

endothelial cells in this connection its expression in fetal liver is consistent with the high hematopoietic activities in the fetal liver and its expression in fetal lung is consistent with the high level of endothelial development in fetal lung to more precisely determine the expression of hub in different populations of hematopoietic cells human bone marrow cells were highly enriched for hematopoietic stem cells by cell sorting based on their cd expression collins et al  stem cells  berenson  j hematother  civin and gore  j hematother  when rna extracted from human cdand cd− bone marrow fractions were reacted with hub primers in pcr hub message was detected in both fractions fig a the fact that only the cd fraction expressed cd message in pcr demonstrates the purity of the sorted population fig b since the cd− fraction contained several cell types the detected hub message might have been produced by endothelial cells alternatively hub may be expressed by a cd− hematopoietic stem cell  the expression of fc receptors fcr and aa antigen in murine fetal liver cells has been used to define distinct fetal liver precursor cell subpopulations carlsson et al  eur j immunol  jordan et al  exp hematol  trevisan and iscove  j exp med  sorting murine fetal liver cells day  based on the expression of these two markers has resulted in the isolation of a small  subpopulation of aa and fcr− cells that are highly enriched for primitive hematopoietic stem cells animal repopulating experiments have shown that fetal liver cells with this phenotype contain longterm repopulating potential upon adoptive transfer into recipients with destroyed lymphohematopoietic system therefore fetal liver cells were sorted into various fractions based on expression of aa and fcr and primers designed from hub that would amplify murine hub message were used to detect its expression figs a and b shows that the highly enriched aafcr− subpopulation was the only population at this stage that expressed hub whereas cd mrna was detected in all fractions tested this result indicates that while cd has been used as a marker of hematopoietic progenitor cells hub marks with greater specificity the longterm repopulating cells within the cdfraction in addition hub expression was also observed in the subpopulation of murine adult bone marrow sorted for ly expression but negative for mature lineage markers this fractionation procedure is a well established technique for isolating a highly purified population of hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow li et al  j exp med  spangrude and brooks  blood  szilvassy and cory  blood  furthermore murine fetal liver cells enriched for longterm repopulating cells by a recently developed method utilizing expression of the mac marker also expressed hub morrison et al  proc natl acad sci usa   taken collectively the aforementioned mouse and human studies indicate that hub is a marker of a subpopulation of early progenitor cells within the cd fraction in particular hub expression in longterm repopulating cells allows its use as a marker for their isolation in this regard an antibody specific for hub or leptin may be used alone or in combination with a progenitor cellspecific antibody such as anticd for example human bone marrow cells can be separated first into cdcells followed by hub sorting to obtain such progenitor cells in addition since hub expression is detected in a cd− subpopulation it can also be used as a marker to isolate a cd− stem cell  additionally early embryonic yolk sac cells have been described to possess the potential of giving rise to both hematopoietic and endothelial cells wagner and antczak  wo in the yolk sac endothelial cells also produce the microenvironment for hematopoietic differentiation and proliferation it is important to note that yolk sac cells with endothelial potential wei et al  stem cells  have also been shown to express hub therefore hub may also be used as a marker for endothelial progenitor cells  example recombinant leptin stimulates bone marrow colony formation   materials and methods   production of recombinant leptin  total rna was

elsevier ny freshney  in culture of hematopoietic cells wileyliss inc pp    results  recombinant leptin was tested for its ability to stimulate bone marrow cells to form hematopoietic colonies in methylcellulose assays when normal mouse bone marrow cells were incubated with leptin in the presence of il gmcsf and epo a twofold increase in the number of cfue was observed as compared to the cells stimulated with medium containing the cytokines except leptin fig  similarly leptin caused an increased number of cfue from obob mouse bone marrow in contrast leptin did not stimulate cfue from dbdb mouse bone marrow an observation consistent with the belief of an aberrant obr expressed by such animals chen et al  cell   additionally leptin also stimulated other types of colonies from normal mouse bone marrow for example bfue was induced by leptin incubation indicating that leptin acts on early progenitor cells of the erythroid lineage fig  furthermore leptin also stimulated the formation of early cfugm colonies indicating its effects on granulocyte erythroid macrophage and megakaryocyte lineages when freshly isolated murine yolk sac cells were incubated with leptin alone cellular proliferation and erythroid development were also induced in conclusion the hubobr is not only expressed in early hematopoietic progenitor cells it renders these cells responsive to leptin stimulation resulting in cellular proliferation and differentiation into cell types of diverse hematopoietic lineages thus leptin is a growth and differentiation factor of hematopoietic progenitor cells   deposit
