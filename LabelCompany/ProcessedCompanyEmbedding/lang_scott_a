privilege and vulnerability management scott lang june nd  facebook twitter google linkedin the cyber attack chain or kill chain is a common reference for illustrating the steps involved in an externallydriven cyber attack after witnessing firsthand so many data breaches that happen as a result of these methods we have developed a summary version that you can use as you make the case to better protect your important data and assets let’s begin by reviewing the steps in the cyber attack chain then i will define six steps you can take today to reduce your attack surface steps in the cyber attack chain based on our experience externallydriven data breaches start when an attacker exploits asset vulnerabilities this can be done via driveby downloads phishing attacks or even direct hacking attempts the verizon data brach investigations report provides ample data on the frequency of such attacks but  of attacks come from outsiders next once inside the network the attacker hijacks privileges or leverages stolen or weak passwords in fact  of breaches involved misused privileged accounts once the attacker successfully becomes an insider they can leverage those privileges and passwords to move laterally and exploit other resources to achieve their ultimate objective – your data what’s scarier than that is it takes an average of  days to realize you’ve been breached taking control how integrated privileged access management and vulnerability management mitigate the risks from cyber attacks how can an organization prevent an attacker from exploiting the perimeter through a vulnerability prevent hijacking and privilege escalation and limit lateral movement start with these basic six steps  identify and remediate vulnerabilities with better prioritization of risks how well are you able to prioritize vulnerabilities or correlate those vulnerabilities against other threats in the wild integratingmultiple threat inputs into a single system for prioritization and “heat mapping” is the one way  limit access to sensitive systems and data by leveraging vulnerability data to make decisions on granting privileges to assets or applications  enforce least privilege to prevent clientside attacks and reduce default user privileges to contain potential account hijackers basically stopping an attacker before he moves laterally  eliminate shared accounts and password sharing uncontrolled accounts are involved in  out of every  data breaches want a fast way to reduce  of that risk store all your enterprise passwords in a single secure store that requires a checkin checkout process and provides a secure enclave for thirdparties  monitor all privileged activities for security and accountability logging must be done for compliance purposes but session monitoring also adds additional benefits – indexed recordings provide keystrokelevel detail on who did what and when ensuring that you have a full audit trail for the auditors  tie it all together by correlating and analyzing user and asset behavior to identify inprocess attacks this is where the value of fullintegrated privileged access management and vulnerability management comes into play this combination of behavioral analytics vulnerability and malware intelligence user and security data from bestofbreed security solutions allows you to outmaneuver attackers and stop data breaches putting it all together the real value of a fullintegrated solution to address every step of the cyber attack chain is that there are no gaps and that you can leverage vulnerability and external threat data to make privilege decisions all of this reduces your attack surfaces and risks want more information on how beyondtrust can help disrupt the cyber attack chain check out the infographic now or request a demo
