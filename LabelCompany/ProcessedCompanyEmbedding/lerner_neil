current information made available by psychemedics corporation heart of hampstead  by neil lerner kitchen design  the kitchen think facebook twitter pinterest youtube search menu   heart of hampstead – by neil lerner kitchen design may  by linda parker neil lerner designed this spacious equipmentpacked kitchen for clients who entertain large numbers on a regular basis neil lerner neil lerner was invited to design this large and spacious kitchen in hampstead north london for clients he had previously worked with ‘they were happy to come back to me and my team’ explains neil ‘we had also designed their three previous kitchens’ q what were the client’s priorities in the original brief this hampstead house has a very peaceful and calm location and was built in  with a countrycottage style the owners originally wanted to take this feeling into the kitchen however once they moved in they realised that many views of the heath were blocked as the ground floor was made up of lots of small rooms which simply didn’t work within the brief q how did you set about fulfilling the brief to open up the kitchen and make it into one larger space with enough room for a family dining table we had to take down a large chimney breast they also removed an old porch a second staircase and passage that went nowhere they opened up the link between the kitchen and former breakfast room converting it into a comfortable family room with exposed wall made of reclaimed brick for added character q what were the owner’s priorities designwise as someone who enjoys cooking and entertaining twentyfour for dinner is a regular friday night occurrence this client had a very clear list of requirements she worked closely together with the team at the beginning of the project to plan the storage surfaces and working spaces in meticulous detail consequently every area of the kitchen works well and makes her preparation and cooking tasks easier the large central island forms both the main preparation zone and the sociable area with its sweeping breakfast bar bridged across one side the cooking zone has an induction hob builtin ovens and integrated fridge running along one wall and there are further sections of tall storage cabinets a double pantry cupboard and integrated freezer the owner also specified a drinks station close to the dining table with roller shutters to conceal a coffee machine mugs and glassware of course it looks good but it’s also perfect for concealing teenage mess q explain the reasons for your suggestions for cabinetry and work surfaces … i suggested a blend of softly coloured cashmere doors with rich brown woodlands worktops and an acacia grey breakfast bar for added warmth and contrast we also used the acacia grey to frame some of the wall units in the living room this simple step introduced more character and balance to the overall design which was continued through to other areas – such as the bespoke shelving to house the client’s vintage model car collection and of course also gave additional continuity to the overall scheme q what is your best advice to your clients when starting out on a new project when embarking on a new project with a new client i always encourage them to take their time and to be sure they fully understand and feel happy with their kitchen design – before a single cabinet is ordered once the kitchen is on site any major changes can become very costly and disruptive so we aim to cover all bases well in advance to avoid any unforeseen issues arising we were happy to be asked to work on this project – the client has had several kitchens from us before and the formula clearly works because we are delighted to say that they keep coming back for more” we love the space and open feel of this kitchen and the way it eases into the family room plus the fact that there is plenty of work surface area for a serious chef and a superuseful mixer lift feature the details all design and cabinetry by neil

my projects   sponsored next page list your business here for free  learn more before you hire a london kitchen designer know what you want from your new fitted kitchen list your priorities according to what you use your kitchen for whether it’s primarily cooking or also dining and entertaining prep space on worktops and ample storage are the primary factors when designing a kitchen but layout is equally crucial kitchen designers can advise on important considerations such as a work triangle which is essential to an efficient cooking space a kitchen designer will likely begin by asking questions about how you use your kitchen space and then apply their architectural and technological expertise to your vision of a dream kitchen to turn it into a space that serves your needs this may involve contracting other professionals including experienced london kitchen fitters plumbers and electricians to carry out specialist work so rely on your designer’s industry contacts and knowhow or some kitchen professionals offer installation inhouse and employ kitchen fitters in london themselves to carry out the fitting of your specially designed kitchenwhat should i look for with kitchen fitters in londononce you have your perfect kitchen design your kitchen designer may be able to introduce you to qualified kitchen fitters in london or you may want to look for one yourself if you decide to find your own kitchen fitters in london then it is important to look for someone with specialist experience in fitting kitchens as they are extremely complicated and are easily damaged during installation your kitchen is intended to last for many years and is often a huge investment so you dont want to let things slip at point of installation a fitter that specialises in fitting kitchens will do much more than simply fit the kitchen in place – they will consider practical aspects of kitchen installation like the best place to put a stop cock for those kitchen water emergencies be sure to get references for your london kitchen fitters and ideally complete a site visit on a recent installation project it could be that your kitchen design company employs their own kitchen fitters in london but always ask for testimonials and do background checks firstquestions to ask kitchen designers and fitters in london may i see your portfolio of previous work what type of education and experience do you have in kitchen design are you and your employees licensed and insured what licenses do you have what other training and affiliations do you have how long will the redesign take to complete will you provide any costsaving ideas do you design ecofriendly kitchens can i add in green kitchen features how long have you been in the business how many projects like mine have you completed who will be working on the project do you employ kitchen fitters within your company or do you work with third party kitchen installers can you provide me with references may i see a current project how do you charge and what does that include can you give me a written estimate how will i be charged for parts and materials when are you available to begin work what is your policy for change orders what happens when cost exceeds the budget what about changes to materials or labour pricing are there any important considerations or concerns you foresee with this projectfind a kitchen fitter or designer on houzz narrow your search in the professionals section of the website to london kitchen designers you can also look through london photos to find a kitchen
