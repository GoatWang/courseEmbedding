jointly by edhec and cfa institute and will be held in london next march we speak to jeffrey diermeier president and chief executive officer of cfa institute jeffrey j diermeier what is the cfa institute policy with regard to partnerships with academic and research institutions and why has it decided to partner with edhec asset management education jeffrey diermeier an important part of our mission is to provide high quality financial education for investment professionals so academic and research institutions are our natural partners we decided a couple of years ago to approach some of the best schools in the world providing undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in finance which significantly overlap with the cfa program curriculum as well as teaching ethical standards for professional conduct given this strategy edhec was an obvious candidate and quickly became a cfa program partner we also wanted to provide opportunities for continuing education for our more experienced members after surveying them we found that there was a demand for an executive education programme focused on asset allocation given edhec asset management education�s considerable experience competence and renown in this area we decided to collaborate and offer a joint annual programme scheduled for march   marked the th anniversary of your institution what have its main achievements been jeffrey diermeier over the last six decades cfa institute has strived to build the leading association of investment professionals worldwide that has involved defining a body of investment knowledge preparing an educational curriculum and examination setting ethical standards for professional conduct as well as disciplinary procedures providing opportunities for continuing education and much besides i believe that cfa institute�s major achievement has been to put in place all these requirements to become a profession throughout we have been guided by our mission which emphasises ethics education and professional excellence as a result we have close to  members worldwide with even more candidates each year we are recognised as the leading voice on issues that matter most to investment professionals and our members are trusted as among the best investment practitioners the generations that built the institute can take some pride in that achievement what challenges lie ahead for the profession and how does the cfa institute plan to prepare the industry for these jeffrey diermeier we are in the process of preparing our strategy for  and beyond and have been talking to a wide range of practitioners executives and academics including edhec�s own professor of finance lionel martellini so this is a timely question but difficult to answer succinctly i think the immediate challenges can be summarised as follows globalisation and the need for emerging markets to �professionalise� and develop their own skilled human capital talent management and the fact that the industry needs to do more to retain and develop the people it employs and provide them with life learning opportunities which interestingly given the changes that are going on in the investment world investment professionals need to increase their breadth of knowledge versus their specialist skills this should be good news for edhec and similar organizations customer orientation the industry needs to evolve to provide customer solutions rather just create products and innovation whereby the industry has to strive to develop new approaches to the world of investment and risk if it is to continue to move forward cfa institute is looking to address all of these issues through a strategy of product development and partnerships with industry academia members and leading experts in the world of investment these are exciting times and we are very well placed to address all these issues on behalf of the investment profession and the industry what are cfa institute�s development goals for europe jeffrey diermeier we are pleased with our achievements in europe we have around  members and  local societies of investment professionals we have enjoyed rapid growth in candidates and members reflecting the widespread acceptance of the cfa program as a global vocational benchmark for serious investment professionals our emphasis on high ethical standards for professional conduct has also proved popular looking ahead we are developing some exciting plans to offer more opportunities for lifelong learning this will include broader and deeper involvement with our educational partners such as edhec we are also busily adding staff and resources to our european office established five years ago as a means for better supporting our expanding membership in the region in particular we are expanding our european advocacy team dedicated to engaging with regulators and others to champion financial market integrity all this demonstrates our ambition and
