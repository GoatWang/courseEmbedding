market review for serious investors and industry executives this special feature contains expert industry commentary through indepth interviews with public company ceos equity analysts and money managers the full issue is available by calling   or via the wall street transcript onlinetopics covered investing in energy  north american shale development  investing in technology  oil and gas  ep  value investingcompanies include linn energy llc line southwestern energy co swn goldman sachs group inc gs and many othersin the following excerpt from the investing in energy report a leading private equity fund manager discusses the economic basis for successful energy sector investingtwst please tell us about quantum energy partnersmr vanloh quantum energy partners has been around since  i actually cofounded the firm almost  years ago we are an energyfocused private equity firm our bread and butter is upstream oil and gas we also do midstream we have a pretty active power practice as well and more recently weve gotten into the oilfield service sector so there are four different kind of verticals of the energy space that we invest in with upstream being our most active area we have about  billion of capital under management focused on investments in the  million to  millionsize rangei think we are a little unique from most of the players in this space in the sense that about half of our senior team here are actually professionals who came out of industry as opposed to professionals who came out of wall street we have a number of technical and operating partners here that have run energy companies either their own or big divisions for large public companies and they are very technically steeped in the petroleum engineering geology and geophysical disciplines that gives us much more of a knowledgeable industryinsider perspective on investing in the space as opposed to coming in purely from a financial perspectiveadditionally we typically invest in a lot fewer companies per fund but make larger more significant commitments and then really work with the companies as partners as opposed to just financial sponsors to really build the companies into substantial enterprises and either take them public or sell them to a public companywe have been pretty involved in innovating within the energy space we did the firstever upstream mlp back in  we took a company public called linn energy line and it was the first of its kind it started a new asset class as far as public companies go linn has gone on to be a very successful company i think they have a  billion enterprise value today so we have done three of thosewe are based in houston the capital of the us energy sector and we have a very active presence throughout north america weve got a portfolio of companies in almost every major basin in the us and canada have some activity over in eastern europe as well as kurdistan over in the middle east but principally we are a north americanfocused investortwst why did you choose the private equity route rather than another type of investment approachmr vanloh i started on wall street i was with kidder peabody back in the early s in the energy investment banking group i was doing ma deals and capital raisings and stuff for upstream and midstream companies i left kidder in  and started my own boutique investment bank helping private companies access private equity and of course back in early s there was not a lot of private equity for energy at all i think there were six investors in the whole country that would put money into upstream oil and gas companies from a private equity standpoint i wanted to be involved in starting and building businesses and as i started representing these private companies in private placements and reinvesting most of my fees back into these companies i fell in love with principal investing i decided that was what i wanted to dowe built a nice little track record from  to  taking small pieces of deals that we were raising money for and in about four or five years we were able to parley that track record into raising our own fund in  working with entrepreneurs is exhilarating it doesnt feel like its work you create things and build companies and its a lot more exciting than the transactional side of the business to metwst when you are looking at potential investments what are
