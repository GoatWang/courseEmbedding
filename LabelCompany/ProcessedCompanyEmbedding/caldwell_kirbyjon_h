yourself in a house of worship doesnt matter which denomination or whether it is affiliated with a denomination at all just imagine some holy place bathed in sunlight on some flawless sunday morning things begin slowly before gradually rising in a crescendo you watch the choir setting up the congregation filing in the background noise of muffled conversation shuffling prayerbook pages and building anticipation then the pastor or any other variety of clergy walks onto the pulpit strictly for the purpose of this daydream allow that person to be me kirbyjon h caldwell pastor of windsor villageunited methodist church in houston texas one of the fastestgrowing churches in americagood morning i begin thanks for coming we have come here to praise the lordthe words serve as a cue for a mighty choir behind me a ninetymember vocal cyclone whose voices rise up in sweet tones of exultation singing weve come to praise himbut im not here strictly for praise im here to talk about some bonedeep deadserious truth not truth about the world of the hereafter but an entrepreneurial gospel of how you can maximize your godgiven potential in the hereandnow im here to help you identify the faith within you that once nourished can rocket your life to new levels of empowerment and good successyou might do a double take when you first see me in the pulpit because i dont preach in some regal vestment not even a suit or a tie im wearing a casual shirt and slacks expensive clothes are not a prerequisite to celebrating the holy spirits presence at the church that you have just entered were here for empowerment not posing any social barriers that might prevent people from feeling comfortable are barred at our door i hope youve dressed casually too because now im directing  percent of my energy upon youyes you maybe you want a little more out of life  or maybe you want a whole lot more maybe youre seeking a more joyful life a more satisfying career deeper relationships more money in the bank better parenting skills a more solid spiritual connection a more healthy body and a more muscular mental resolve or maybe your needs go deeper maybe youre sick lonely battling addictions frustrated suffering disease battling low selfesteem adrift in life but if youre thinking god simply offers some pieinthesky sunday religious promise without regard to the realities of a stormy monday you are about to discover a whole new worldafter all you are a vip like any normal person youre seeking answers to three of lifes most basic questionsvalue what am i doing with my life that makes a differenceidentity who am ipurpose why am i heresuddenly the sunlight explodes through those stainedglass windows the choir lifts its collective voice in awesome exultation and youve found yourself in the midst of a miracleweve come to praise him sings the choir clapping hands and swaying back and forth a force of ninety people all pointing their fingers directly at youthen a light shines down from heaven and you hear some startlingly good news god wants you to be successful god has literally laid all the bountiful gifts of the universe at your feetand im not just talking about the traditional concept of spiritual blessings but redemption in every aspect of your existence your emotions entrepreneurship career finances relationships health parenting skills academic career and more you have been given the promise of a successful and absolutely abundant life but you must stand up claim it and develop a strategy to attain ityoure on your feet now arms in the air running down the aisle like somebody whos won the lottery or picked the right door on a tv game show the people who matter most in your life  your husband or wife mother and father children friends and associates  are gathered around you hugging you congratulating you wishing you wellyou have become whole in every aspect of your existenceyou have entered the place of holistic salvation with special emphasis on that first syllable whole in this place there is no such thing as a halfway god  or a partial person here god doesnt restrict his grace to your soul but watches over every aspect of your well being god doesnt bless you on sunday then turn a blind eye the moment you step into the streets gods salvation is available every day of the weekwhole keep this word in mind throughout the reading of this book its the oneword essence of holistic salvation and being in it to win it once you become whole within yourself and within gods preferred vision for your life you have begun to position yourself in the aspired place of holistic salvation all of the pieces of your life  your financial emotional relational professional physical and spiritual pieces  will be in sync not as pieces of some convoluted puzzle but as pieces fitting harmoniously together as a whole you will be complete  ready willing and able to realize gods optimal plan for your futureyou might think the scenario presented above is a fantasy but ive seen it happen over and over again at windsor village where our worship celebrations are just as likely to end with a prayer for blessed social relationships or economic opportunities as with spiritual redemption there is however one caveat god is not a gameshow host god doesnt always offer instant gratification god sets up a road to success to holistic salvation a road that can have as many ups and downs as a roller coaster and only those willing to make the sacrifices of the journey enter the place where all your dreams line up with gods purpose for your life whether its an emotional state a financial condition or a spiritual transformationnow i know what youre thinking wheres the road map whats the fee and where are we going well the road map is in this book the fee is whatever price you put on persistence and the destination is as i mentioned before a place called holistic salvationlet me take you therethe power centeri have discovered in life that there are ways of getting almost anywhere you want to go if you really want to go  langston hughesif you want to see holistic salvation in action come to windsor village a church whose membership has grown from  to more than  in the past sixteen years at windsor village we dont just preach about holistic salvation we practice it daily were a lean mean kingdombuilding machine with over  ministries serving the community seven days a week there are ministries for everything from job placement and financial planning to weight loss and alcohol rehabilitation ministries for everything that will help somebody step out of the herd and become a leader of his or her own lifethe story of windsor village is prayer coupled with action and proof of the incredible power of this combination stands one mile from our church the power center the name of our acre squarefoot multiuse business complex designed to address the multifaceted needs of our community the power center is our churchs physical manifestation of holistic salvation we actually salvaged an abandoned kmart building and autosupply store and turned it into a reservoir of empowerment serving the communitys needs culturally economically educationally emotionally medically socially and spiritually the power center houses a private school the imani school a university of texas science centermemorial hermann hospital health clinic a chase bank of texas branch office a houston community college business technology center a womaninfantchildrens wic center which aids approximately  women and children each month and a full complement of executive suites individual businesses the fourthlargest conference centermeeting facility in the city and much much more the wall street journal newsweek the bbc nbctv and other media have hailed the power center as an entrepreneurial incarnation of the twentyfirstcentury church we got the idea from walmart a megamarket with everything under one roofover the next few years the power center will pump about  million into the local economy it has already added  new jobs to the community most important it meets the diverse needs of our community inside one building bringing together the diverse pieces of life that we once had to go to dozens of places to find  which in an important sense is the essence of holistic salvationmy mission in this book is to show you how to use the principles of holistic salvation to create an internal center of power in your own life just as god doesnt limit grace to matters of the soul the power of holistic salvation is not restricted to the walls of worship holistic salvation involves knowing that god wants you to be successful in all areas of your life and armed with that knowledge and inspiration to build a life that is the epitome of good success as defined in joshua to begin you need to know where you want to go in your life yes i know youre probably thinking thats not so simple well using the principles of holistic salvation will help you discover gods primary purpose for your life and how to achieve ityou must be present to winfirst step to achieving holistic salvation congratulate yourself for getting this farim not kidding you have something to celebrate youve beaten some incredible odds the fact that youre reading these words tells me that you possess the most important aspect of your ability to employ the principles of holistic salvation to find your calling and follow your vision into an incredible new realm of livingyoure alivethats one whale of a feat a rare accomplishment i frequently ask myself why are you still here kirbyjon hines caldwell why when so many of the folk you grew up with went to school with or began work with are dead or dying why did you survive why is god preserving your life why didnt you succumb to the growing statistics of doom that level our nations population what made that equalopportunity destroyer  the forces that can snuff out a princesss life as easily as a pimps  pass over your houseby the time i was twelve or thirteen years old i had been a pallbearer in more funerals than i had attended weddings my high school classmates and church members have been weeded out like soldiers in a war heres just a small sampling of victims from my high school classfletcher carter the wrong end of a shotguncaroline wiseman sicklecell anemiagerald guinn car crashchucksy ferguson complications due to cardiovascular surgeryrecently another boyhood friend died even more tragically he had been in a car accident about eight years earlier he survived the wreck but not the aftermath he became a paraplegic he never quite got over that one tuesday during rush hour he rolled his wheelchair out in front of an eighteenwheeler on the  freeway in houstoni could go on and on car accidents drownings suicides drug overdoses alcoholism workaholism unprocessed anger cancer brain aneurysms selfdestructive behaviordeath has an arsenal of weapons waiting to destroy you consider your own list of lost souls for a moment then ask yourself why am i spared as painful as death is it does offer at least one potential prism of enlightenment death reminds us of the wonder of life life is truly gods most precious gift as the nobel prizewinning author toni morrison writes your crown has already been bought and paid for so put it on and wear itwhy have you been spared its up to you to determine the reason and live out gods primary purpose and promise for your life gods promises of success are incomplete however without your faithful response god may promise but you must push god may declare but you must decide to pursue that divine declaration god may will it but you must walk it out in other words gods supernatural power is maximized when it is coupled with your faithful application of your godgiven ability remember this equation gods supernatural ability plus your faithfulness to act equals success or as my grandmother used to say god helps those who help themselvesyou dont have to always ask god for some supernatural move as some sort of proof that god loves you thats like awaiting permission from general motors every time you want to drive your car add one critical ingredientaction never allow the enemy of negativity to paralyze you its easy to focus on what you dont have step out on what you haveim going to give you a stepbystep road map to the summit of holistic salvation but for now there are four preliminary steps to begin as preparation for the journey ahead before you can find your calling then follow your vision use these four steps as sort of a preamble a house cleaning a way of preparing yourself for the inner and outer growth that is yet to come realize that god wants you to be a winner but its your responsibility to learn and follow gods vision for your optimal futurefor a long time there was a gulf a divide that eventually grew into a canyon in my thinking between who i knew god to be and what god wanted me to have i went to primary school and attended church in the socially torn neighborhood where i grew up in houston on lyons avenue the crooks seemed to have a disproportionate allocation of prosperity the socalled bad guys the pimps prostitutes hustlers and numbers runners were driving cadillacs and wearing diamonds while some of the saved persons appeared to be struggling so there was a gap in my mind between being spiritual and being prosperous this was further underlined by some churchgoing folk who thought you had to be financially broke in order to be holy its tougher for a rich man to ascend to the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle theyd say quoting  and misinterpreting  the wellknown biblical versethen when i was in seminary a powerful verse in joshua  began to resonate in my soul the book of law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it for then will you make your way prosperous and then you will have good successi was floored lights literally went off in my head you shall meditate in it day and night that you may observe and do according to all that is written for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good successwhoa i thought god wants me to be prosperous and have good success god did not make provisions  whether its stocks and bonds nice cars and nice homes or peace of mind joy and healthy selfesteem  for satans kids gods provisions are for his children if theyre for anybodynote that allimportant qualifier good success which is to imply that there is bad success the pimps and the prostitutes that i used to know they had bad success if they had any success at all because their work was illegal immoral and unscriptural and they were taking advantage of somebody else the robber barons of corporate america who embezzle money fleece the gullible and defraud the innocent they also have bad success god wants us to have good success that doesnt necessarily mean having a sevenfigure income or five mercedes and a maserati it means that you dont have need for that which god has promised you dont have to go begging for bread with your tail dragging on the ground and your hand stuck out looking for love in all the wrong places god is calling you to be the head not the tail crowned with glory and honorthis realization can trigger a powerful mental realignment if you dont believe that god wants you to be successful  if you never realize that god wants you to have selfcontrol and inner peace have a decent paying job go on vacation  you will intrinsically develop behavior patterns that will destroy your potential to accomplish those goals in order to receive and maintain certain blessings in life youve got to realize that god wants you to have them it is important to give yourself permission to be blessed otherwise handling success successfully will be a constant struggle you can become a spiritual schizophrenic feeling that you arent deserving of material possessions emotional empowerment or spiritual stamina or even worse digging yourself into the rut of emotional and spiritual poverty and powerlessness furthermore unless you believe god wants you to be comprehensively successful youre less likely to ask for the revelation of and empowerment for holistic salvation asking someone for that which you are not certain she or he can provide is an absolute waste of timefor example did you know that the ownership of land is sanctioned by god its practically unscriptural not to own land in the old testament owning land was a sign of gods presence and blessing a sign of safety it could be actual land or emotional land sometimes your promised land is not something you can see touch and feel sometimes its a spiritual move sometimes an accomplishment sometimes its a healed marriage sometimes its an obedient child a healthy selfimage or a healed body the cattle upon the thousand hills of psalm  verse  belong to the children of the lord in other words because im a child of the lord im entitled to some cows not only is economic development okay with god the bible encourages us to go forth and prosper as wellso the first baby step toward holistic salvation is to realize that god wants you to be successful  blessed with a bounty of good success if you want to be a winner you have to have some funeralsyou heard me right funeralsyouve got to bury everything thats holding you back if god ordains the blessings of good success and youre not reaping your fair share of blessings then there are some things  or some bodies  standing in your way now think about this for a minute you know what those things are youve got to bury that fear bury that doubt bury that funky nasty attitude bury those old family habits that haunt your current relationships with your children spouse friends and business associates bury that wicked tongue that likes to cut people up one side and down the other side when your energies should be spent on your own selfimprovement bury that mind of doublemindedness bury that indecisiveness that selfdefeating belief that life is nothing but rough roads and miracles are reserved for the moviessome of us need to bury some relationships with sometimey parasitic leeching socalled friends and yes even some family members you can get a strong indication whether you are in a selfdefeating relationship by asking a simple question is this person helping me propel myself toward gods preferred future for me or restraining me from moving toward that future this question is equally applicable toward business associates if youre in a relationship that is full of all sorts of headaches hurt setbacks and danger then you need to bury it you cannot move consistently toward the summit of holistic salvation if youre carrying satans backpackdid i say satan indeed i did if you think that satan is some cartoon character just wait until chapter  well devote a full chapter to satan and his many deceitful guises for now know this the devil is out there waiting to trip you up the devil wants you to become disgusted disenchanted discombobulated and any other dis that he can think of thats the devils job to dis you to become qualified for success youre going to have to do some housekeeping youve got to open the doors on the devils hiding places in your life and boot him outif youre always sucking up to what somebody elses expectations of you are then where is your identity where is your integrity where is your dignity purpose selfdefinition and godanointed power every now and then its better to stand alone than to blindly blend into the pack in other words its better to be a lion roaring alone than a donkey braying with the dirty packsome folks selfesteem is so low they think so lowly of themselves they do not want success  either for themselves or for you those are the folks whom you can ill afford inside your concentric circles of friends or associates they will not only leech off of you if youre not careful youll eventually adopt their mentality then your desire for excellence and your pursuit of goodness will begin to dull and youll be ready to settle for mediocrity and once youve settled in there getting back on the path toward salvation is tougher than ever so get rid of those naysayers  nowand funerals arent just for people negative ideas and emotions from your past can hold you just as effectively without the benefit of arms somebody reading this book is still being held hostage by something that happened forty years ago you cannot move forward if youre always looking backward learn from your past but dont allow your past to incarcerate you build upon your past dont be buried by your past you have to turn your back to the past and press on toward your high calling apostle paul said forgetting those things that lie behind i stretch toward those things which are aheadthis is not a rerun or a repeat its time for us to move onconsider these wonderful words stretch reach press strivetheyre active verbs lion words words of action and power now consider words like guilt and remorse and regret these are donkey words passive mulish language that takes you nowhere  at least not to those places where a lion wants to go words that keep you sinking into the quicksand of yesterday whats then is then this is now your dark yesterdays can be transformed into bright tomorrowsas it is written in the bible but jesus said to him no one having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god luke say it loud been there done that thank you im movin on become qualified to winafter you bury your excess baggage and begin to move forward you have to ask yourself another question are you qualified for success if god were to give you your calling and you could discern gods primary vision for your future right now would you be ready to receive it are you ready to handle success successfully you may not know where youre headed but this much you can know where you are right now is not where youre going to end up your life is dynamic not static i once heard a very accomplished seventysixyearold man say with utmost confidence my best days are ahead of me yes he meant it and because of his conviction he convinced meyou have to prepare yourself for success so when that calling comes  and believe me it will come  youll be ready to make your move impossibilities are merely things not yet learned the writer charles w chestnutt once said his meaning the only impossible things are those we havent mastered  yet and becoming a master requires some duespaying time as a disciplethese days theres a big belief in instant gratification we want it and we want it right now some of us believe that because we can microwave pizza tv dinners and turnip greens we can microwave success the same way but becoming a winner usually takes time you want to tell other folks what to do at work but you dont show up on time you want to be a manager but you cannot manage yourself somebody reading this book thinks they should be promoted on their job because theyve been there a long time well just because youve been there doesnt mean youre ready to move ahead unless of course youre qualified a person with fifteen years of experience may have had the same experience annually for fifteen years seniority does not automatically mean qualificationif you expect to move up the food chain of life you cant just wish for it you have to be prepared for some that means education for others it means counseling for others it means learning how to influence people for still others it means alcohol or drug rehabilitation if you do what youve always done youre going to get what youve always gotten goes the wellknown axiom to expand your world you have to not only know about the world outside your existence but be prepared to step into it when that time comes as motivational leader tony robbins once wrote knowledge is one of the ways to break the shackles of a limiting environment no matter how grim your world is if you can read about the accomplishments of others you can create the beliefs that allow you to succeedas an example of how qualification manifests success lets consider the story of baba and the marching band that played out in miami florida in the miami central marching rocket was qualified oh yes the rocket the name of the member marching band of the innercity miami central senior high school had honed its music to nearperfection with grueling threedayaweek practices thirty minutes of each session was set aside to exclusively train for a faraway dream the band held in its collective consciousness to be chosen as one of twelve bands out of  entries from across america to march in the mother of all parades the macys thanksgiving day parade in new york city when the judges made their decision the rocket rejoiced the band had won a slot in the parade but then the band members discovered it takes more than talent to march in the parade it takes a staggering  in expenses that was a seemingly impossible number for these mostly africanamerican kids in innercity miami many from lowincome singleparent families the schools resources were so meager many band members wore pullovers and sweatpants because of a lack of uniforms and others were still waiting on trumpets trombones and percussion instrumentswith a year to raise the money the band members began beating on doors holding fundraisers seeking community support selling chocolates doortodoor performing for pay at parties and practicing always practicing but after six months of work they had raised less than then one night a fortymember unit of the band was hired to play two songs for  at a bar mitzvah in a miami hotel part of the job was to march through the ballroom as the band crossed the lobby in their greenandwhite uniforms they caught a wealthy businessmans eye not just any businessman but foutanga dit babani sissoko who goes by the nickname of baba once an impoverished unschooled west african house servant from the edge of the sahara baba had amassed a fortune first as a gold miner then in oil casinos and diamonds now hes perhaps most famous for giving his money away grants to schools and hospitals  tips to hotel maids cash to the poor and homeless exhibiting such generosity that a rock star in his home country of mali wrote a song in homagewatching the band cross the lobby baba sent one of his assistants over to ask the band members about their performancewere performing to raise money for our trip to new york the bands administrator replied explaining the  plight of the miami central marching rocketthe assistant huddled with the businessman i would like to help baba said the kids watched in amazement as he pulled out a checkbook and wrote out a check then the assistant asked the band members to huddle around the businessmanwould anyone like to guess how much the donation would be asked the assistant who served as babas interpretera hundred dollars exclaimed one band memberthree hundred exclaimed anotherno the interpreter said mr babani sissoko would like to make a donation of  to your band the roof went off the hotel the band administrator remembered the kids were so ecstatic they were jumping up and down screaming and crying and hugging baba the businessmans assistants and bodyguards had to literally form a circle around him to keep the kids from smothering himwhen the miami central marching rocket blasted off in two minutes of thanksgiving day airtime on nbc playing rhythm is gonna get you and god bless america the bands national debut had made an important statement our story sends a message we can all learn from says band director shelby chipman you never know whos around you or who might be watching so always be on the alert always be at your best and most of all always be ready it can happenthe miami central marching rocket was prepared for success even though they didnt know when or if theyd be able to exhibit that preparation they didnt wait on their travel money before they began their journey toward their march down fifth avenue the paralysis of analysis gets you nowhere action is majesty the band acted on faith and continued marching forward in their dream trusting that somehow some way if they were ready the money would come sure enough when their blessing arrived they could stand up and seize itbecause they were qualified when god calls answerimmediatelyhow do you respond to gods blessings once they appearyou move immediatelydeliver me from pin cushion powder puff people who sit around waiting and expecting deliverance like a letter in the mail people who sit on their humpty dumpty behinds receive whatever trickles down like humpty dumpy they eventually fall off their walls of complacency  and nobody can put them back together again life is not passing out blessings for those who sit and wait you have to get out on that battlefield and claim your blessings youve got to step up to the plate and take what is rightfully yourssome of us have allowed the devil to rob us of our blessings because we sat on our holy humpty dumpties waiting instead of going when god said go if god hasnt answered your prayers maybe its because the last time you asked he answered and you havent moved on the answer you were given way back in when you are blessed enough to encounter a vision give it the respect it deserves move on it immediately its not just about doing it its about doing it now because to wait is just as faithless as saying no when god says yes if youre hesitating you need to know why because if the devil knows and you dont know then the devil knows more about you than you know about yourself and will know precisely which traps to set to best drag you into the hell of disillusionment and despair discovering and dealing with your dark side issues is absolutely necessary for holistic salvation the list of former and potential success stories who imploded because of a lack of selfknowledge and selfdiscipline is disgracefully long we will deal with this in subsequent chapters but for now know this you cannot allow the devil to know more about you than you know about yourselfive discovered that there are two kinds of faith one is what i call a buzzard kind of faith buzzards out in east texas are always circling the sky eyes on the ground never the horizon looking to feed off the dead whatever is left over after something else has come along and made the kill the second kind of faith the faith that we need to instill in ourselves is an eagles kind of faith an eagle always gets first shot an eagle never hesitates an eagle doesnt waste its time on leftovers or residue an eagle swoops in with precision and power we should aim for the eagles worldview refusing to settle for mediocrity insisting on getting the fresh blessings on the front end not the leftovers on the back end an eagles kind of faith is a real threat to the devil a buzzards faith is circumstantial at best the choice is yoursto employ another analogy optimal living is like buying an ice cream cone you buy an ice cream cone at  oclock and eat it right away then you get to eat ice cream you buy it at  and wait until  oclock to eat it then youve got nothing but a mess what used to be ice cream is now running down your hand and dripping onto the floor thats the way a lot of us treat our godgiven blessings we were given the miracle of life the equivalent of a heavenly ice cream cone of absolute potential and promise but instead of licking it we just let it sit there some of us thinking ill save it for later but the longer it sits the messier it gets until when you finally decide youre ready to eat your ice cream theres nothing left to lick your window of opportunity has shiftedbe in it to win itlife can be unfair you do not always get what you deserve you get what you fight for  archbishop nicholas duncanwilliamsfor some of us there is a canyon of a difference between what we are experiencing in our lives right now and gods promises for our lives whether the canyon gets bridged is a function of our faith of course and more importantly whether we are able and willing to fight for what we claim to believe to have faith inthere is also a difference between being a winner and winning everyone who wins is not necessarily a winner winning is an occurrence

win scripture reminds us fight the good fight of faith timothy  you are more than a conqueror through jesus christ romans  you have overcome the wicked one  john  your faith is the victory that overcomes the world  john do away with the inaccurate notion that the lord does not want us to fight is soft on crime or is wimpishly deferring to the desires of the devil and his imps nonsense apostle paul reminds us in romans  that we should prove what is the good acceptable and perfect will of god regardless of your present reality the lord god almightys perfect will is for you to be among other things a faithful fighter who is more than a conqueroronce you determine i am in it to win it several advantages or blessings occurê gods promises can be confirmed in your lifeê you can

salvationcopyright    by kirbyjon h caldwell finding your callingyour call to greatnessthere are two great moments in a persons life the first is when youwere born the second is when you discover why you were born  unknownwhat is the highest secret to victory and peace to will what godwills and strike a league with destiny  william algeri believe we are all born for a reason and it is our responsibility to discover that reason and redirect our lives toward gods optimal purpose for our lives once that discovery and redirection occur you are undeniably positioned to be a winnerit wasnt until i turned twentyseven  after living for twentysix fruitful rewarding experiencerich years  that i discovered the reason why i was borni hope to help you develop a road map toward your destiny in the next six chaptersthis is not an ordinary spiritualselfhelp book no book writtenby a former fasttrack bond broker with an mba from theuniversity of pennsylvanias wharton school on the cusp of making more than  in  who gave up his promising career to become a deadbroke entrylevel pastor could be called ordinary its usually the other way around isnt it you know the stories irosefromlivinginmystorageunittorunningamultibilliondollarcorporationinnineshortmonths not many authors would be excited about giving up a potential sixfigure income and a job brimming with promise and possibility a job that afforded me the new sports car the power clothing the unlimited potentialto become the pastor of a dying churchbut something more than cash propelled me from one career path onto another to discover a greater truth than id ever have known if i had kept my day job it all started with a single recognition a first step we all have to take if we are going to grow our lives from ordinary to extraordinary its something that we are given at birth but have to ferret out like a treasure hunter without the luxury of a map something that can be the absolute starting gate of your new life if you can only recognize it for the significance it possessesnow bear with me a minute dont start moaning oh no not another preacher talkin about a calling really when you think about it every great achievement starts with a calling although im hesitant to even use the word its been abused and overused scoundrels go to prison and come out called public figures get in trouble with power money drugs or sex and emerge from jail or divorce court called criminals get called right between the jurys decision and the judges sentencing some folks have simply given the term calling a bad name nonetheless in order to begin the journey of holistic salvation the word calling is simply irreplaceablebut im not talking strictly about a spiritual calling im talking about a total reawakening a calling to realize your full potential in every aspect of your life i like to compare a calling to a lunar eclipse only its not the overlapping of the sun or the moon but the optimal alignment of your mind body and spirit with gods primary purpose for your life when this happens something will click within you and you will know youve found your calling its an instinctive gutlevel spiritual experience prior to its occurrence a calling is a difficult concept to explain its something like louis armstrongs description of jazz if you have to ask what jazz is youll never know youll know it when you see hear and feel it until then its like a very dim light in a dense fog that you must follow until you find its sourcehow to find your callingfrequently the seeds of your calling are in the simple reflexive things you do to compensate for some real or imagined shortcomings the actorcomedian robin williams was a shy and studious only child forced to spend his days alone in his parents fortyroom michigan home usually only a maid would be in attendance his parents were always away his father on business his mother doing charity work his father was so distant robin called him sir and lord stokesbury viceroy of india the boy so longed for a connection with his mother he began using comedy to get her attention ill make mommy laugh and thatll be okay and thats where it started he would later explain he had found his calling as a comedian but if robin williams had spent his energies moaning and groaning instead of releasing his frustrations on a stage we would have been denied one of americas greatest comic geniuses his sadness eventually led him to bring joy to millions of people  and to his successthink about it did you react to a problem  or declare a passion  in your youth that may have pointed the way toward your future if so write it down and begin thinking about it in detail some of us are shown our calling in our youth but as adults were required to take concentrated action on that calling this was the case of sheree perry a member of our congregation when she was a child sheree told anyone who would listen that she was going to become a tomato lady shes just always had a passion for food cooking food displaying food discussing food knowing that cooking was her calling she grew up to be an incredible chef but cooking alone couldnt lead her to the summit of holistic salvation where her calling would empower every aspect of her existence she wasnt making any money from her cooking and worse she found herself in the middle of a divorce then while driving on the houston freeway one day she says she had a revelation from god on how to turn her calling into a career she went back to school for courses in business management and today she runs a lucrative catering operation the bible says that god gives you authority over certain things she says well hes given me the authority to cook to taste my food is something that would linger forever on your mind its all the love that i put into it its just a powerful anointinganother child another city he was such a shy boy he would routinely forsake the ordinary boyhood games to cling to his mother as she spent her days pursuing her passion  shopping in a discount dress shop the boys eyes would widen over the dresses that lured women like magnets back at home the boy spent hours watching his bubbe his grandmother sew the older woman had eked out a living taking in sewing after her husband abandoned her the boy idolized his grandmother and soon took up sewing himself once even making an entire wardrobe for a doll that belonged to a friend of his older sister i never went through this thing most young people do the boy would say later going to school and not truly knowing what they want to do until later in life i mean i had a major head start  at age five i had a pretty good idea of what i wanted to dothe boys calling was clothing and his name calvin klein has become a standard in the fashion industry for the past three decades what initially made him different eventually made him great think about it what makes you different how could that difference be employed to propel you in a new purpose a new meaning in your lifesometimes your calling can be revealed to you in a simple single voice you must hear the voice and heed its advice thats what happened to harry wayne huizenga the garbage man after returning to florida following a stint in the us army huizenga was hired by one of his fathers friends to drive a garbage truck in pompano beach after a few years of driving that truck a line that his father had repeatedly told him began resounding in huizengas head you cant make any real money working for someone else huizenga decided to take action on that advice he started his own garbage collection company with a single truck and  in accounts picking up trash from  am until noon then spending the rest of the day looking for new accounts he became rich first with his own growing garbagecollection company and later with the advent of the vcr by building the massive blockbuster video store chain the garbage man had become a billionaire the owner of three professional sports teams and a model for entrepreneurs everywhere and it all began when he heard and heeded words that he had been told for most of his lifefinding your calling opens the door upon the second step of the why of your birth because once you recognize your calling and follow it to the place it ultimately leads you will eventually gain sight of gods preferred future for you a literal picture of what youre destined to do thats so bright and so unmistakable its not merely a sighting its a visiona vision of who you can become and what you can doperhaps the best example i can give you of the power of a vision involves a man i first noticed sitting in the back row of windsor village one sunday morning in the late eighties a muscular africanamerican guy with a quiet yet powerful presencei had never heard of the boxer evander holyfield even though he was a regular on sunday mornings although he lives in atlanta his training camp is in houston and he attends windsor village whenever hes in town later he would even generously underwrite our new  million prayer center but back then i didnt even know his name until someone came up behind me on the pulpit and whispered evander is herewarren moon then the houston oilers quarterback and also a windsor village regular told me that evander had boxed in the  olympics and had been disqualified on a technicality now hes going to fight as a heavyweight warren said he has a chance to be a real good oneas i got to know evander i discovered that one important aspect of his success as a champion was his ability to create a crystalclear vision of where he was going his vision came to him in a transcendent experience when he first met his father the youngest of eight children evander never knew his dad as a kid his parents never married but they kept in touch mostly because of the persistence of evanders late mother annie i always promised myself that i would bring evander back when he was grown she would later say i didnt want him to think that he came from nowhere i wanted him to know who his daddy wasone day evander and his mother drove into a tiny southern alabama lumber town there evander a twentyoneyearold cruiserweight boxer wondering if he had the genetic material to grow into a heavyweight stared at his father and saw a reallife vision for his own future the man was a broadshouldered pound lumberjack big as any heavyweight it was a good feeling evander said laterin that instance when a twentyoneyearold man met his estranged father evander holyfields vision became clear to some day fight for  and win  the title of heavyweight champion of the world he could literally see his future standing before him he knew from his fathers size and heft that he had the ability to grow his body from cruiserweight into heavyweight status in that moment evander became a heavyweight in his mind an ordinary circumstance became an extraordinary moment a vision was revealed a future champion anointedyour equally transcendent moment awaits you if you can only trust that someday some way your calling and later your vision will appear when you discover not only who you are but also why you have been born then your hills are lower and your valleys are higher your journey through life will be smoother thats not to say your rose garden is without thorns but the trauma of travel is definitely minimized when you know where youre going  and why your life is no longer focused on defining yourself but on traveling toward your destination and on this journey there will be some moments when the traveling is as enriching as reaching the destinationfinding your calling and a vision for your future might take you a lifetime but is it ever too late to discover what you have been born to doyoure on a mission from godshe figured she would remain a registered nurse forever for almost ten years she had risen in the ranks from the lowestlevel clerk to scrub tech to fullfledged rn dutifully passing all the tests and doing all the work required frequently coming home too exhausted to even remember why she initially entered the field sometimes she would feel a pull from somewhere deep inside of her a faint faraway voice whispering three simple words this isnt it but she figured its a job its a paycheck and brushed off any thoughts of dissatisfaction with the dawn as she trudged toward one more day in the life of a basically unfulfilling careerif someone would have taken the time to ask her a simple question  is nursing your calling  the nurse the woman who had devoted her life to her career would have had an immediate answerno she would have certainly replied but im too busy with the daily grind to pursue anything elseyour calling is nothing less than a mission from god its gods primary will for your life it is the first step toward the promised land of holistic salvation but while the process sounds simple for many it remains extremely complex a school of knowledge that education doesnt really address a code that science has yet to crack but its something that is actually discussed explicitly in the bible what were you born to do in life you were born to glorify god and follow his purpose as weve discussed earlier deep within all of us is a reason for our existence a purpose a calling finding your calling and following it is to not settle for anything but the best in yourself and in the process to glorify god and not to settle for anything less in your life i believe that a true calling involves three different aspects first the calling glorifies god second it blesses benefits or helps somebody else third it brings you joywhat were you born to do in lifeas a pastor i have heard the question asked repeatedly this central question of life in our church we spend a lot of time identifying spiritual gifts godgiven gifts talents and confidences that the individual member can bring to serve god and our church but in discovering their spiritual gifts scores of our members have invariably been led onto new and expansive career paths they could not imagine before the philosopher thomas carlyle called finding our purpose the first of all problems and thats precisely what it is it is the first of all problems for a man or woman to find out what kind of work he or she is to do in this universe carlyle wrote work is the primary activity of living like it or not we spend more hours on our jobs than in any other activity if the work that literally consumes your days is unsatisfying unrewarding and unfulfilling then the other areas of your life will probably follow suitif you believe your career isnt connected to every area of your existence just consider three of the infinite areas an unfulfilling life can destroy mental state an unemployed existence is a negation worse than death itself because to live means to have something definite to doa mission to fulfilland in the measure in which we avoid setting our life to something we make it empty the writer jos ortega y gasset once wrote human life by its very nature has to be dedicated to something health for many years it has been known that jobrelated stress is a major contributing factor in a wide range of diseases writes laurence g boldt in his marvelous book how to find the work you love it is perhaps not surprising then that according to the national centers for disease control and prevention more people die at nine oclock on monday morning than at any other time of the day or on any other day of the week monday is also the most popular day of the week for suicide recent studies have indicated that the greatest risk factor for fatal heart attacks is not smoking hypertension or high cholesterol of which weve heard a great deal but job dissatisfaction researchers at columbia university have observed a link between coronary disease the leading killer of american adults and the individuals sense of control in his or her work life child rearing the pioneering psychologist carl jung said nothing has a stronger influence psychologically onchildren than the unlived lives of their parentsnot only was each of us born with natural talents and confidences but through the gift of salvation were also blessed with something the bible calls spiritual gifts these are duties and attributes of the highest order which properly employed are intended to glorify god and bless one another realigning your life toward your spiritual gifts  whether its the gift of teaching administration wisdom giving hospitality or to be exact twentyone other spiritual gifts  can rocket your life to an amazing new levelits up to us to determine what those gifts and confidences are at windsor village we offer all new members what we call a spiritual gifts workshop designed to help people find their specific godgiven gifts and we hope their calling some of our members pursue their spiritual gifts via involvement in a ministry others experience such a revelation over discovering their gifts that the revelation alters every aspect of their existence especially their career path weve discovered that the workshop basically confirms what people felt they should be doing all along even though they had nothing on which to base those inclinations they felt their desires were dreams when they could have been realities when your work becomes a labor of love then its not really work anymore but ive learned that vocational tests and evaluations cannot compare to the power of a simple single question a question each of us must ask and answer for ourselveswho are you and what were you born to becomeyou have to know your mission before you can accomplish it you have to know your dream before you can achieve it you have torealize that somewhere deep inside of you no matter how bright or how dim is an eternal desire to do something an absolutely specific something through the haze of growing up and going out as we attempt to walk through the carnival funhouse mirrors of parental desires peer pressures and careerconsultant rap amid the chorus of voices all commanding us to conform in the blink of the eye between childhood and adulthood we forget deny or never take the time to really realize what is it we were born to do we look to parents family popular culture want ads or the marketplace of least resistance we look everywhere in short except inside our souls the place where the answers to our calling reside some of us give up hope altogether some waste a lifetime drifting through deadend jobs others settle for compromised positions putting money ahead of dreams and ending up eventually dissatisfied others accept whatever comes along in their lives without ever truly seeing what could be god is not glorified when people are systematically impoverished sick disenfranchised oppressed diseased unemployed begging for bread ignorant andor broke when your life is reduced to a fight for survival you are denying your holy mission from godthe proof of the power of finding your calling is evident in any real success story but one of my personal favorites comes from norman cousinss book anatomy of an illness in which the author visits the ailing musical master pablo casals a few weeks before his ninetieth birthday the maestro was in bad health his wife had to wake him help him dress and lead him into the breakfast room judging from his difficulty in walking and the way he held his arms i guessed he was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis cousins writes his emphysema was evident in his labored breathinghe was badly stooped his head was pitched forward and he walked with a shufflebefore sitting down to breakfast casals performed a daily ritual he sat down at the piano arranging himself with some difficulty on the piano bench then with discernible effort raised his swollen and clenched fingers above the keyboardthen norman cousins witnessed the medicinal miracle of a callingthe fingers slowly unlocked and reached toward the keys like the buds of a plant toward the sunlight cousins writes his back straightened he seemed to breathe more freely now his fingers settled on the keys then came the opening bars of bach he hummed as he played then said that bach spoke to him here  and he placed his hand over his heart then he plunged into a brahms concerto and his fingers now agile and powerful raced across the keyboard with dazzling speed his entire body seemed fused with music it was no longer stiff and shrunken but supple and graceful and completely free of its arthritic coilswhen he was finished cousins writes casals stood up far straighter and taller than when he had come into the room he walked to the breakfast table with no trace of a shuffle ate heartily talked animatedly finished the meal and went for a walk on the beachwhat had happened was of course phenomenal but a phenomenon all of us have within our grasp it was the power of creativity of a man at peace with what he was born to do in this world creativity for pablo casals was the source of his own cortisone writes cousins it is doubtful whether any antiinflammatory medicine would have been as powerful or as safe as the substances produced by the interaction of his mind and bodythe power of a calling isnt limited to the masters of art and music its equally majestic when applied to the life of a dissatisfied registered nurse the member of our congregation described earlier cheryl pitremitchell figured she would remain a nurse forever it was after all a secure job with a healthy income a respectable career path but it wasnt her passion it wasnt her calling then she enrolled in the spiritual gifts workshop at windsor village and took a written test designed to discover the answer to the question what are you meant to do with your lifeit was a question no one had asked her in a long time it got cheryl to thinking when cheryl was finished with the test her answers stretched across more than a dozen pages  showing skills in administration leadership and most of all a real passion for teachingthis woman was born to be a teachershe realized she had been a teacher in some form all her life in every area of her existence even in her nursing career cheryl pitremitchells passion involved the teaching aspects of the jobit was a revelation like a lightbulb going off in my head she remembers it was the first time i had seen my history tied to my present and my future i began reflecting on everything i had been involved in since my youth even when i was in elementary school the game i loved most was playing teacher children would come from the neighborhood to play the game and i always had to be the teacher but it wasnt just a game to me i was deadserious about it really i felt that god had been preparing me all of my life to be a teacher but it wasnt until i took that test that it all made sense it gave everything i had done up to that point validationcheryl pitremitchell had found her calling a launching pad for her new life she became an entrepreneur founding her own consulting business centered on her passion for teaching now not only does she run an extremely lucrative business educating adults she has also found an even greater joy in educating young people in our church she traded a steady paycheck for her passion no longer adrift in a sea of choices she could now make decisions based upon a central question will it propel me in my calling or leave me mired in the extraneous by finding the answer that had always resided deep inside of her heart  that she was born to teach  she could move forward in the knowledge that she had aligned her life with gods purpose for her additionally my financial blessings have multiplied many times over from my paycheck as a salaried employee she says best of all im doing what god created me to doto move toward your calling  to follow your bliss as joseph campbell wrote  is to put yourself into the arena where real growth can begin to occur cheryl pitremitchell registered nurse would have been forever stranded in the to cheryl pitremitchell an entrepreneurteacher who absolutely adores her work has placed herself on the launching pad for a personal and professional blastoff in the words of martin luther king we are prone to judge success by the index of our salaries or the size of our automobiles rather than the quality of our service and relationship to mankind to which id like to add a quote from emerson if you love and serve man you cannot by any hiding or stratagem escape remunerationthe rule is this do what you love the money will follow the author marsha sinetar discovered this firsthand eighteen years ago she had what she calls a great longing to change my life she had a secure job in public education a nice home family and friends nearby but deep inside she was dissatisfied and too scared to do anything about itin reality i did not truly trust myself she writes i was afraid to cross uncharted unconventional waters to get to a more desirable place in life afraid that  when truth be told  i would not have the requisite strength and competence to accomplish what i so dearly wanted my mind clung so desperately to the familiarthen one day as she was driving to work in los angeles a random thought entered her head as clear a thought as if someone were speaking to me do what you love the money will follow at that moment she knew i had to and would take a leap of faith i knew i had to and would step out cut myself loose from all those things that seemed to bind me i knew i would start doing what i most enjoyed writing working with industry instead of public education and living in the country instead of the citymarsha sinetar followed her calling she did what she loved and the money did indeed follow today she owns her own successful private practice in organizational psychology mediation and corporate change management advising some of americas top corporate executives her philosophies have so withstood the test of time she wrote a book about it its title do what you love the money will followlisten to those random thoughts that appear in your head they might not be as random as they appearit all starts with a single question a question i now want to pose to you what are you meant to do with your life if you dont know the answer yet dont worry it will eventually come if you keep asking yourself that crucial question that question is the first step toward finding your calling your mission your dreamafter you ask yourself the first question take the spiritual gifts workshop test in the box belowconsider the following questions write your answers down being as specific as

lies behind us and what lies before us are small matterscompared to what lies within us  ralph waldo emersonflood is the word they use wrote toni morrison of the mississippi rivers tendency to routinely flood sections where man straightened the river to make room for development but in fact its not flooding its remembering remembering what it used to be all water has a perfect memory and is forever trying to get back to where it waswe too know instinctively who we are all we have to do is look back and remember who and what we were before life like the river developers began trying to straighten us outi believe one answer to why you were born is in the where of your birth and if you examine your past youll find signposts pointing toward your optimal future let me tell you about my own evolution in the hope that while reading youll be inclined to begin searching your own past for clues to your calling think of the process as something like reassembling the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle until you can recognize a pattern i think youll be amazed at the patterns that will appear i know i was when i reassembled minei was born on august   the son of a tailor shop owner and a homeeconomics public school teacher in st elizabeths an allblack hospital in the fifth ward of houston i was named by a languageloving uncle who after returning from france after the war suggested joining my two grandparents first names  kirby and john  into kirbyjon some might have wanted to argue that this fancy name seemed out of place in my neighborhood i was brought up in kashmere gardens on the border of the fifth ward where one section was called the bloody fifth for its habit of hosting at least one homicide every weekendalthough civic pride and a sense of community were quite pronounced money or the lack of it was the common denominator in the fifth ward but while we might have been lacking some material things we never felt disadvantaged my folks gave me a love that was warm and constant i rode to kindergarten at texas southern university with my dad and back home with my granddad kirby hines who worked as the superintendent of buildings and grounds i rode to grade school with my mother who taught and subsequently became a counselor at the high school across the street on weekends i worked in my fathers tailor shop caldwells tailors at  lyons avenue in the heart of the fifth ward on lyons avenue you could see all sides of life hotels pool halls taverns dope dens houses of prostitution and right next door to my daddys tailor shop club matinee a mecca for black entertainment on weekends club matinee was rocking with the live music of the greatest names in show business from ray charles to b b king many of them wearing clothes made by my fatherfrom the beginning i was exposed to all sides of life i worked amid the pockets of poverty of lyons avenue on one hand i experienced the soulstirring redemption of our church on the other hand i lived in a neighborhood of pimps and prostitutes and hustlers and pigeon droppers on one hand and was supported by a very stable loving family on the other hand i heard people talking about black power on one hand but cried when black folk burglarized my daddys tailor shop on the other hand i had this strong sense of duty to my community on one hand and had my nextdoor neighbor break into our house twice on the other hand i witnessed choir members who were my grandmothers contemporaries sing traditional hymns on sundays on one hand and on the other had tina turner walk into my boyhood bedroom when she came over to have dinner with my parents and kiss me goodnight on the foreheadit was a world of good and bad success and failure conservative and cuttingedge what a world of differences what a balance one of the dropouts who preceded me at my first junior high school was a big rambunctious student named george foreman who joined the job corps just after being suspended for breaking a hundred or so school windows with rocks in the job corps big george found his calling  boxing he earned an olympic gold medal turned professional stripped joe frazier of the heavyweight title and came back ten years later to become the oldest heavyweight champion in historythe job corps gave foreman an avenue a road a direction toward his calling  boxing  and eventually that calling led to his vision first winning the heavyweight championship of the world and later using his fame and natural magnetism in a second career as a minister on the other hand i watched the downward spiral of our nextdoor neighbor the kid who twice burglarized our home he could never get out of his pain long enough to find his calling much less a vision for his future and he rotted away like a piece of old fruitwhat kind of world was i living in where id be awakened by a telephone call from the burglar alarm company after another breakin at my daddys tailor shop one night and be kissed into dreams by the queen of rock n roll the next where i watched the demise of our nextdoor neighbor the burglar on one hand and the rise of george foreman on the other where id hear stokely carmichael preaching about black power during the day and be awakened in the middle of the night because black folks pulled another crash burglary driving a car through the plateglass window at my daddys store where id watch my father  without a single curse word or even apparent anger or resentment  resiliently restock his store like a patient man building a sand castle on a beach only to have another burglary a few weeks later knock it all down once again until every insurance company in houston denied my dad insurance coverageit would be years before i would enter the seminary and read the passage in joshua  about how god wants us to have good success a passage that would trigger the realization that the wealth of the world  whether spiritual mental or material  is meant to be enjoyed by gods children not satans henchmen but back then the lord had merely planted a seed he hadnt yet led me to the gardenfrom the relative calm of kashmere gardens we drove to mount vernon methodist in the fifth ward where my parents got married and my mothers parents got married come rain shine burglary or homicide we sat in that church virtually every sunday thinking back now i remember that church not as a white house high on the hill above the wreckage below but as a haven set solidly in the middle of iti had found my rock my salvation in my home church but amid the swirl of growing up in the multitude of choices that began to cloud my vision and block my clear career path i wasnt yetready to accept the church as the site of my calling certainly not a career calling but nonetheless there it stood a beacon shining in the darknessnow pause for a moment and consider your own childhood ask yourself a few central questions and write down some answers what did you truly love to do as a child what events tapped into your emotions especially theemotion of joy who did you most admire as a child if your life were a movie with you as the main character isthere a moment from your childhood that could be staged asan awakening when people asked what do you want to do when yougrow up what was your answerconsider your natural strengths  or weaknesses that you overcamewhen you are looking for obstacles you cannot findopportunities  j c bellfrom the beginning i felt that god was an equalopportunity blesser in all areas of our existence but the vision of holistic salvation was still a long way in the distance back then i couldnt have spoken about holistic salvation even if i could have given it a name because i was a stutterer and a stammerer the childhood victim of a speech impediment frequently my voice just wouldnt work id open my mouth andit would be a verbal train wreckyou got to be patient when you talk with kirbyjon people would say there seemed to be a short circuit between my mind and my mouth when i got excited  and i got excited a lot  the words would tumble out in a jumble my elementary school mates would tease me but i kept right on talking although ive blocked it out of my mind my mother tells me she took me to a speech therapist who said i was suffering from delayed speech that i was thinking faster than i was speakingmy folks found a solution oh yes they didmake the boy speak in front of people they exclaimed let him overcome his speech impediment by speaking  public speakingthink about it when you acknowledge your weakness and offer it to god then it can become a strength if you stay in denial about it then it will stick with you forever every time our school or church had a christmas or easter program or an assembly or a prayer session my folks would stand up and insist kirbyjonll do it church programs and elementary school assemblies became my speaking venueslord have mercy id stand on the side of the stage at nat q henderson elementary school in the fifth ward heart pounding knees knocking sweat pouring down my face frozen with fear my mama had given me a oneline prayer shed gotten from unity magazine to repeat for moral support id repeat the line over and over and over to myself so often before stepping out trembling that id almost forget my speechgods will for me is health and harmony and i am made wholetheres that word again whole not half i thought about this early on standing there before the congregation at mount vernon methodist caught in that life of contradictions the words repeated themselves in my mind for so long they became ingrained within me an empowering oneliner that would serve me someday but back then i was only trying to win the battle over my mouth and that battle of course i eventually won like a boy being taught to swim by being flung into the deep end of a swimming pool by the time i got to high school that speech impediment was virtually gonegods will for me is health and harmony and i am made wholeit was a clue a signpost pointing to my future i had a gift for speaking in front of people i would later learn that there was a name for my gift preaching but i wasnt ready to recognize it much less follow it to where it would lead not yet anyway but god had planted a seed i became a young voice in my church i served as steward helping take up the money during worship service i also made the announcements as my voice grew stronger and my passion for worship deepened the old folks began talking youre going to be a preacher someday theyd sayid answer no wayi was going to be a businessman after all i was extremely good at deals i even cut a deal with god i was determined not to become a bootleg preacher if god wanted me in the ministry then i figured hed call me to do it i gave god plenty of chances the first was when i was an undergraduate at carleton college in northfield minnesota i knew that yale divinity school offered a program for folks who thought theyd been called to the ministry i applied with a little prayer to myself okay god i said if you want me in the ministry then youll use yale university and get me admittedthe representatives from yale came out to interview me i made the first cut and then during the second round of screening they cut me i got rejected my reaction wasrelief god apparently wanted me in business and i was happy to oblige i applied and got accepted into the prestigious university of pennsylvania wharton school where i earned my mba and headed up to a job on wall street in new york city to make some moneyyour calling will call you  answer with actiona call is only a monologue a return call a response creates adialogue  gregg levoy callingson the fourth tuesday morning in october  my calling began to manifest itself i was sitting at my desk at hibbard oconnor and weeks a bondtrading firm in houston i was poised and polished and a picture of professional perfection i had all the fasttrack credentials that wharton mba and one year as a wall street broker and investment banker i had just returned home to houston three months before it was the summer of  i was a newly hired fixedincome institutional bond salesman driving a brandnew gray z  sports car and racing toward a sixfigure incomethose were the days when a single account could erupt like an oil well a gusher the lowest guys on the totem pole at that point were making  to  sixfigure incomes were the norm one salesman at hibbard oconnor was pulling in  million a yearit was the gold rush era of houston and i was standing on the ground floor waiting for those elevator doors to open and deliver me into sixfiguredollars country now let me tell ya that was big money back then not many africanamerican males could make six serious figures in   especially without wearing a sports uniform the rest you could count on one hand gerald smith who worked at hibbard oconnor and weeks and a few professionals and i was in a position it was generally agreed to make six figures it was simply a matter of timeall i had to do was not mess it upbut there was something of that calling business still stirring deep within me a slow and steady progression like the soft yet incessant beating of a jazz quartets drum it was a faint sound in the distance but i couldnt deny that it was still there perhaps i began to qualify the calling about a month before i moved to houston in a most unlikely place i was at my desk on wall street it was a typical to day and i was a green wharton mba grad freshly hired by first boston corporation to work in the publicfinance department still a trainee i was sitting at the municipal training desk when that old familiar sense of calling came over me i was not ready to go into the ministry at that point i did not believe i was to go into the ministry at that point but obviously my conscious had been percolated to at least being curious about it the old folks would say god was still planting those seeds in retrospect maybe they are righton that particular day i called eugene brooks my mothers godfather whom i claimed as my godfather as well goddaddy had given up a profitable houston liquor store when he decided to devote his life to the lord he served as a deacon in the good hope missionary baptist church in houston whose members included the late great honorable barbara jordan who went on to national notice as a member of the congressional committee that investigated watergatewhen my godfather answered the phone that day we exchanged the usual pleasantries and then i got down to businesshow do you know when youre being called to the ministry i asked my godfatheryou know when you stop asking and start telling he saidwhew i expelled some serious oxygen once again my first reaction was relief i didnt feel like telling so i figured i hadnt been called i filed the thought back in my someday file you know that attic of the mind where we stack up all of our someday things maybe someday id want to stop asking and start telling but for the moment i was interested mostly in selling so six months later i barreled back to houston yet one more soldier of fortunesince kirbyjon was too long and cumbersome for a prospect to pronounce much less for potential clients to spell and remember i went by the name of kjfrankly it didnt take a wall street background to sell bonds the technical part helped but what was most important were persistence good relational skills and a thick skin the really successful guys were not as strong on the technical side as they were in salesmanship and drive and determination  and most of all cold calling lemme tell ya these guys could work those phonesthis is k j caldwell with hibbard oconnor and weeks in houston texas id exclaim as an opener in the countless cold calls i made every dayin front of me was a big board filled with inventory the bonds i had to sell there were municipals sba loans ginnie maes and freddie macs my calling area was ohio missouri and part of new york i had a phone book filled with the names of chief investment officers at banks along with a profile of the banks stock and bond portfolioi would do my homework make the phone call and attempt to pour on that charmgood morning mr potential bond buyer kj here id say and ive got one whale of an incredible opportunity to talk with you about this morningmore often than not id get through i became impervious to rejection but after only three short months in that hothouse sales job the old sense of a calling soon returned this time loud as ten thousand fans at a collegiate championship gamepicture this scene for a moment there i was the proud twentyfiveyearold houston bond broker blasting toward financial security cruising down to austin for the weekend in that z to attend the university of texasuniversity of houston grudge match with my first cousin james junior williams oh man it was the perfect fall football day in the football capital of the world the winner of that game would ascend to the pantheon of the southwest conference the cotton bowli wish you could have been there the texas heat had surrendered to the first cool breath of autumn and memorial stadium was packed to the rafters the stadium attendance had broken all previous records extra seats had been set up on the jogging track and grandstands had been built in the end zone but the fans werent in their seats from the first kickoff they were on their feet so much cheering so much enthusiasm so much pride so much energy there wasnt any sense of suffering no hint of anyone being without it was one endless wave thousands of people caught up in the emotion of being a part of somethingearly the next morning with the cheering still ringing in my ears i drove back to houston for the eleven oclock church service still acting as announcing clerk i stood up in front of the congregation and made the announcements about upcoming events and needtoknow issues then for some reason i started talking aboutthat game i wanted to share with them the energy and enthusiasm of thousands of people standing on their feet and rooting for their team i just couldnt get the cheering out of my mindwouldnt it be wonderful if everybody would root for the lord like they were cheering for those two football teams particularly for ut i saidand i began to cry now im not talking about a little catch in the throat or a solitary tear sliding down a cheek im talking about sobbing im talking about a flatout fulltilt river of tears streaming down my facepastor brown came up behind me and placed a reassuring hand on my shoulder i had stopped asking and started telling although i didnt realize it not yetwho knows pastor brown told the congregation this might be your next pastorand the congregation said in a collective voice amenbut i still couldnt recognize it couldnt feel it couldnt see hear or know the calling by its very nature a call usually doesnt reduce itself to easy explanation its tantamount to explaining the inexplicable verbalizing something that is intrinsically not verbal there is something about a thoroughly explained calling  at least to the fulltime pastoral ministry  that would dilute the power of the call its like trying to describe your first glimpse of the grand canyon or your first step onto the face of the moon words will never do it justicebut then the very next afternoon my office phone rang andwell it was a cold call from god im serious about this it was the big one as they say in earthquake verbiage or in the language of nuclear bombs and heart attacks and it reengineered my lifeyoull feel it in your heartbefore you know it in your headthe next day a monday at  pm i was sitting at my desk and the phone was ringing not the phone on my desk but a far deeper more urgent ringing how can i describe it as i said it certainly doesnt lend itself to easy explanation it was a ringing that didnt make a sound a rumble that didnt make a move an incessant tapping on the shoulder but when i turned around nobody was thereit was a knowingwhen you discover your calling youll realize it as instinctively as the mississippi river knows how to return to its original course despite attempts by man to reroute it youll experience an inner synchronicity an unmistakable sense of flow athletes call the experience being in the zone its that seemingly effortless moment of physical and mental perfection when everything is going your way youre playing golf and you cant make a wrong drive or putt youre running a race and you hit a stride you didnt know you were capable of hitting youre making a speech and something clicks and new words deeper meanings and richer premises burst forth it comes from someplace deep within youhere are seven ways to recognize a true callingcharacteristics of a calling your mind soul spirit and body are in sync your synchronized mind soul spirit and body are alignedwith gods primary will for your life you are filled with resounding enthusiasm to begin yournew journey you may not be certain which route to take how youregoing to get there how long its going to take nor howmuch it will cost but in spite of these unknowns yourenthusiasm does not wane you believe sense or know that god wants you to follow thecall therefore you proceed by faith you realize that any other activity would result in a smalleror lesser contribution to self family community or societyat large your enemies view your calling as a threat once its impactis realizedmy calling represented the point in my life where god positioned me to create the greatest value to myself my family and my world im not saying that prior to the call i didnt add value im saying the calling positioned me to contribute optimal value to be the best that i could be your calling will combine germinate and package the best that god has placed within you it represents gods best and highest use of your life any other use of your time would be a lesser application of your godgiven personal resources if you follow your calling you will eventually be able to apply everything that god has already placed within you to make a singular difference in your world can you imagine how awesome our communities would be if most of our citizens received and walked out their respective callingsbut of course its easier said than donegoing to work that morning i didnt say to myself im going to quit my job and go into the ministry today but when that moment engulfed me it was impossible not to go with the flow i had no idea where this calling would lead i didnt know anything about seminary about the education and other requirements it takes to go into fulltime ordained pastoral ministry but none of this mattered this was not the point for questions or analysis i was merely a passenger riding something vastly bigger than i was all i knew was that i was in a zone my mind body and spirit had become one only i wasnt swinging a golf club or running a race or making a speech i was being called by god to dedicate my life to fulltime pastoral ministryin retrospect i might have employed some intellect to the situation but i was listening to some silent voice from deep within a voice that i couldnt deny  and dared not ignore  an overwhelming feeling of this is it it was a locomotion that overrode all logic you just know it when it happens at least i did i heard a calling so strong and fierce that it literally lifted me from my desk and sent me marching into my bosss officevanquishing the voices of doubteach of you must discover where your chance for greatness liesseize that chance and let no power on earth deter you  chariots of firefinding your calling is a pivotal first step on the road to holistic salvation but once you find it then an army of demons  denial selfdoubt insecurities and a score of others  will arrive to attempt to derail or destroy your course well talk more about this in chapter  as the poet e e cummings wrote its difficult to be nobodybutyourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you somebody else to follow your calling cummings wrote means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fightingthis is beautifully illustrated by the old testament story of jonah the prophet described by author gregg levoy in the book callings as the patron saint of refused callings you remember jonah who was called by god to preach to the people of nineveh jonah thought he was too good for the ninevites not only did he refuse gods call he also booked himself on a ship sailing in the opposite direction not amused god sent down a violent storm upon jonah even though he was perhaps the strongest sailor on the ship jonah not only refused responsibility for the storm he created but went belowdecks to sleep in solitude gods fury was swift the storm increased in velocity finally jonah confessed his disobedience to the sailors and stressed that the only way out of the storm was to toss him overboard which they eventually did jonah then landed in the belly of the whale which three days later spewed him back onto the beach of nineveh where his preaching eventually converted the ninevites gregg levoy wraps up his story by quoting arthur koestlers book the act of creation the guilt of jonah is that he clung to the trivial and tried to cultivate only his own little gardenif its any consolation writes levoyso does everybody when confronted by a calling at least initially everybody to some extent backs away from their authenticity settles for less hobbles their own power doesnt speak when spoken to in dreams everybody occasionally ignores the prompting of the soul and then the discontent that ensues trying to distract themselves by counting their blessings the reasons they ought to be happy with their lot in life content with things as they are things that may once have been bealls and absolute endalls but that lost their intoxication after five years put them on automatic pilot after ten and became a prison after fifteen we all have a part of us forever incalculable and arch that simply fears change and reacts to it with a reflexive flinchand a calling is a messenger of change a bell that tolls for thee and it brings on the fear that frightens away sleepin the afghani tongue the verb to cling is the same as to diefollowing your calling usually involves some sort of dramatic change when you align your life with gods will the conjunction of body mind and spirit or the calling will become apparent of course aligning your life with gods will means that you must allow god to change you shape you work within you gods character by gods very nature never changes never deviates god is complete once you realize this  that you have to change not others and certainly not the world  you have taken your first step into a new arena of living you have reached the gates of holistic salvation where you can begin to experience true growthdont expect a welcoming party to await you doubters and naysayers may dog you every step of the way satan doesnt need minions there are plenty of human beings more than willing to do his work i personally discovered the devious powers of doubt when i decided to give up my brokerage career to join the pastoral ministry naysayers rose up around me like a flock of cackling birds when doubts and doubters surround you  and once you find your calling they undoubtedly will  you have to focus and press on this may be particularly difficult when the biggest doubters are the people closest to you in a world built on conformity the nonconformist is destined to doubt and ridicule as helen keller once wrote unfortunately there is plenty of courage among us for the abstract but not the concrete dreams rarely stir up much trouble but acting on them does act upon your dreams and some people will undoubtedly tell you youre crazy take it as a sign youre heading in the right directionkj youve gone crazy my boss exclaimed when i walked into his office and without one hint of doubt in my voice exclaimed im quitting my job and going into the ministryi thought hed be happy for me i wasnt asking i was telling but i dont think my boss really understood my coworkers eyebrows shot up like red flags a few former wall street cohorts even cursed im not going to lie they talk pretty rough in the bond business soon my phone would be ringing from my associates in new york their doubts over my decision became an unexpected occurrence someday those same associates would applaud my move but back then it was a collective chorus of have you lost itgod has called me into the ministry i repeated to anyone who would listenother people came into my bosss office trying to talk me out of leaving including the person who was instrumental in getting me hired gerald smithkj you must be crazy he said youre doing so well youve only been here three months and youre on the verge of becoming a real superstar in the investmentbanking arena how can you make a decision to go into the ministryi was so far gone why hold back now its not a decision i made i said its something god has called me to donow i dont really recall what came next i dont remember leaving the office heading to my parents home  i had been living in my old bedroom since returning home from new york  or even sitting down with my family at the dinner table but my mother father grandfather and sister all remember the dinnertable conversation like it was yesterdayi have something to tell you all i began i quit my jobthere was absolute silence around the dinner table it was like the food was caught in their throats nobody made a move for a few seconds and then all heads swiveled toward my grandfather kirby hines who was big on making budgeting and saving money his fork was suspended in the air and his mouth hung open id been helping the family out sending them on vacations buying gifts and now thisive been called to go into the ministry i saidthe ministry my mother had a greatuncle and a cousin who were pastors so we had a preconceived image of pastors lives they appeared to have neither any money nor much of a life outside of the church they lived in the parsonage adjoining the church which was supposed to make up for the low salary where the congregation could keep constant watch over the pastors business now the successful songrandsonbrother of the caldwell clan was headed into the gray life of no diversity no fun and no moneymy grandfather began firing questions most around a central theme youve got years of seminary ahead how do you expect to pay for it how are you going to live how are you going to support yourselfi had no concrete answers to my path but i had no doubts as to my directionthe decision is made i said im basically just sharing the news with youi couldnt be dissuaded and then something happened that i do remember right after quitting my job and telling my family i experienced the greatest sense of peace and tranquillity and inner synergy id ever experienced it was absolutely overwhelmingi had taken a major first step i had finally taken the majestic step of action a long road loomed before me full of equal parts pain and struggle promise and growth but one thing was certain i was on my way to becoming whole a perfect alignment of divine purpose earthly mission and newly discovered personal desire i completed a fouryear program at the perkins school of theology at southern methodist university in two and a half years after serving as associate pastor in churches in dallas and houston i was appointed to a much smaller church in southwest houston which had recently been renamed after the subdivision that surrounded it windsor village prior to the calling pastoring was not a consideration after the call however it was a completely different story i was clear about what god wanted me to do and i wanted to answer gods calling with actioni remember the first time i saw it my first real appointment out of seminary i rounded the corner off heatherbrook drive and found a quaint yet stark onestory sanctuary the preacher was leaving the first sunday in june  the sunday before my arrival leaving behind a congregation that had dwindled down to twentyfive members when i stepped inside the sanctuary on that first sunday the members of the congregation and even the bishop who had appointed me probably didnt expect me or the church to last for long the church was dying and some folks were basically content to let it die it was after all caught in a transitional neighborhood which had turned from caucasian to africanamerican worse still there were already two large and booming baptist churches in the immediate areaanyone whos willing to join a church has already joined the other two instead of windsor was the common consensus windsor had no choir no music no sunday school not only was there no money but the church owed  to the united methodist churchs roomtogrow program the land adjacent to the sanctuary sported a for sale sign  a lastditch effort to raise funds to pay off the churchs loan and keep it in business but this struggling church still held fast to its most precious asset  faith its twentyfive members had been praying for the church to grow and for someone somehow to arrive to lead them with a new vision for their future but the latest in a line of pastors had departed without finding success in fulfilling the visioni had found my calling the why of my existence my purpose in life it was time to quit asking and start telling wed have to use our faith coupled with hard work to revive our church as a congregation wed have to develop and employ the principles of holistic salvation to literally save the ground beneath us or leave behind another empty lot where a house of worship had once stoodwe would have to turn the page on our destiny we would have to make a comeback the devil surely meant for our little church to diebut god had different plans for our little church and the lord has awesome plans for you too jeremiah how do you know what the lords plans are for you ask him he will help you develop your own personal todo list with that you have an effective operating manual to tackle any size comeback before we

freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
