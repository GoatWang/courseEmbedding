beliefs the only mediator of advertising effects on brand attitude andrew a mitchell bioand jerry c olson bio mitchell andrew a and jerry c olson  are product attribute beliefs the only mediator of advertising effects on brand attitude journal of marketing research august – reprinted with the permission of the american marketing association fishbein’s attitude theory posits that beliefs are the only mediators of attitude formation and change the validity of this proposition for consumers’ beliefs about product attributes and brand attitudes was examined in the context of an advertising effects study to manipulate product attribute beliefs and to create settings in which other mediation processes might occur the authors exposed subjects to simple advertisements that contained either a verbal claim or visual information level of repetition also was varied as expected product attribute beliefs mediated attitude formation however another variable termed attitude toward the advertisement also mediated brand attitudes and purchase intentions the authors discuss alternative explanations for the results and offer suggestions for future research attitude defined here as an individual’s internal evaluation of an object such as a branded product has been an important concept in marketing research for the past  years there are at least two major reasons for this longterm interest first attitudes often are considered relatively stable and enduring predispositions to behave consequently they should be useful predictors of consumers’ behavior toward a product or service second social psychology has provided several theoretical models of the attitude construct eg fishbein  mcguire  rosenberg  triandis  wyer  these conceptual frameworks especially fishbein’s have stimulated much of the attitude research in marketing most of this work however has been descriptive and pragmatic in orientation theoretical issues have been relatively neglected to increase the usefulness of the attitude construct marketers must develop a clearer understanding of the causal determinants of attitude formation and change  olson and mitchell  also see lutz  lutz and bettman  these causal influences are of critical importance because they mediate the effects of marketing decision variables such as advertising or price on consumer attitudes thus a better understanding of the causal dynamics of attitude formation would not only aid marketing researchers in measuring the attitudinal impact of marketing variables but also help managers develop more effective marketing strategy attitude theory fishbein   fishbein and ajzen  presented perhaps the clearest theoretical exposition of the causal basis of attitudes according to fishbein and ajzen  p  “a person’s attitude is a function of his salient beliefs at a given point in time” beliefs are the subjective associations between any two discriminable concepts salient beliefs are those activated from memory and “considered” by the person in a given situation  fishbein and ajzen  olson kanwar and muderrisoglu  as these ideas are operationalized in the typical marketing research study the attitude concept of interest is a brand and the related concepts are product attributes that is marketing researchers have been mainly concerned with consumers’ beliefs about attributes of a brand fishbein’s nowfamiliar attitude model specifies the relationship between the set of salient beliefs about a concept often termed cognitive structure and an overall evaluation of or attitude toward the concept editorial note throughout the text the greek letter “sigma” will be replaced with “e” therefore the above equation would read as “eb ie i a o” in the text fishbein clearly intended the attitude model in equation to describe only the predicted relationship between measures of the theoretical constructs eg see fishbein and ajzen  p – that is the algebraic model provides a means of estimating the beliefattitude relationship that was formed as a result of causal mechanisms the model itself does not “state” the causal proposition nor does it specify the causal mechanisms fishbein also proposed that the attitudebelief relationship specified in equation holds for attitudes toward a specific behavior such as buying a product a act however the set of salient beliefs may not be the same as for a o  fishbein and ajzen  in turn attitude especially a act is if you would like to authenticate using a different subscribed institution that supports shibboleth authentication or have your own login and

research volume        pages  exploring the relationships between meansend knowledge and involvement michael s mulvey pennsylvania state university jerry c olson pennsylvania state university richard l celsi california state university long beach beth a walker arizona state university abstract  this research investigates the cognitive basis for involvement we propose that the meansend knowledge about a product that is activated in a situation creates perceptions of personal relevance or feelings of involvement we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by describing the meansend knowledge of consumers at three levels of involvement why do some consumers seem to care more about some products and brands and not others why are some consumers highly motivated to seek information about certain products or to buy and use these products in particular situations these questions concern consumers involvement a key concept for understanding consumer behavior involvement refers to consumers perceptions of personal relevance for an object activity or event cf bloch and richins  to date however most research on consumer involvement is at too high a level of abstraction to explain why people perceive a product to have personal relevance in the typical measure of product involvement such as zaichkowskys  personal involvement inventory pii consumers give direct ratings of their interest in a product or their perceived importance of a product such measures indicate the overall level of consumers overall involvement with the product but they do not indicate the cognitive basis of that personal relevance this would require measures of consumers knowledge beliefs concerning how and why a product is personally relevant celsi and olson  suggest that the perceived personal relevance of a product is determined by the activated cognitive structure of meansend associations that link peoples knowledge about product attributes and benefits with their selfknowledge about important needs goals and values in this paper we describe an initial attempt to measure the cognitive basis for involvement by measuring the meansend knowledge structures that represent consumers perceptions of personal relevance meansend theory a meansend chain is a simple knowledge structure that links product attributes to the consequences produced by these attributes gutman  olson and reynolds  described a meansend chain with six levels of attributes consequences and values ordered from less to more abstract see figure  for example a couple may decide to deposit money at a small local bank because it is nearby concrete attribute and provides friendly personal service functional consequence personalized service is seen as important because the couple wants to establish a trusting relationship with the company responsible for managing their money psychosocial consequence in order to satisfy their need for security terminal value a meansend chain is the cognitive representation of the connection between a persons knowledge about a product salient attributes and benefits and their self knowledge important psychological and social consequences and values thus the end consequences of some meansend chains can be quite abstractceg a persons life goals and personal values the meansend approach is based on the assumption that consumers see products as means to important ends this means that the personal consequences produced by a product are more important more selfrelevant than the characteristics of the product itself a product is selfrelevant to the extent a consumer sees it as instrumental in achieving important consequences or values when meansend knowledge is activated from memory or formed in a situation the person perceives the product to be personally relevant and feels involved with it celsi and olson  thus meansend knowledge structures are the cognitive basis for involvement they also account for how and why consumers feel involved with a product in a particular situation since researchers have not measured the productrelated knowledge that underlies involvement we conducted a simple study to demonstrate the usefulness of meansend theory in representing personal relevance in particular we wanted to explore two broad issues about the content and structure of consumers product knowledge content how does the meansend knowledge about a product differ between more and less involved consumers are there systematic differences in knowledge about attributes consequences or values structure do more involved consumers have a more complex network of knowledge compared to less involved consumers do the interrelationships differ at the attribute consequence or value levels methodology to examine these issues we identified three groups of consumers with very different levels of involvement low moderate and high and compared their meansend knowledge structures about tennis rackets we measured subjects involvement with the activity of playing tennis because most peoples selfrelevance is focused on playing tennis not on tennis products we measured subjects product knowledge about tennis rackets because this is the most critical product for playing the sport subjects were  people from a university community selected on a convenience basis this group consisted of  women and  men ranging in age from  to c were between the ages of  and  all but four of the subjects were college students we measured subjects involvement with playing tennis using zaichkowskys  personal involvement inventory pii scores can range from  based on their pii scores we assigned subjects to three nonoverlapping involvement groupsclow pii n medium pii n and high involvement  n most people in the low involvement group were novices who played tennis only infrequently and were uninterested in the sport people in the medium involvement group played tennis occasionally to frequently and were moderately interested in the sport people in the high involvement group played competitively on a daily basis and were highly committed to the sport in fact several were on the university tennis team thus the three involvement groups represented a wide range of involvement from quite low to extremely high three to four weeks after completing the pii we assembled subjects in small groups of  to  to measure their meansend knowledge about tennis rackets figure  table  listing of meansend concepts we used a selfadministered questionnaire developed by walker and olson  to elicit peoples meansend knowledge essentially this paperandpencil procedure allows subjects to administer the laddering interview to themselves first subjects wrote down the product features they thought people in general consider when purchasing a tennis racket next they were asked to identify the characteristics that they personally would consider when buying a tennis racket for their own use of these they checked the four most important choice criteria in their purchase decision next subjects completed a selfadministered laddering interview for each of the four choice criteria the procedure began by writing the reason the first choice criteria was important to them often this was a functional consequence of some sort then they wrote why that answer was important what does this get you this usually produced a higherordered consequence this pattern of writing why each answer was important continued until subjects could go no further they reached the end of the meansend chain this selfadministered laddering procedure produced four meansend chains for each subject consisting of two to five levels each analysis we used a computer program called laddermap gengler and reynolds  to help analyze the laddering responses the analysis began with a content analysis to reduce subjects idiosyncratic responses to a common set of meanings two independent judges conducted the content analysis and disagreements were resolved in discussions with a third judge we identified  concepts that summarized all the attributes consequences and values mentioned in the laddering responses table  lists the final meansend concepts along with examples of the verbatim responses that make up each concept next we examined the connections between the attribute consequence and value concepts these linkages are often called implications an implication is the perception of a causal or instrumental relationship between two concepts a red car implies a fast acceleration a meansend chain is merely a sequence of causal implicationscan attribute implies a consequence which implies another consequence which implies a value two types of relationships between concepts are possiblecdirect and indirect implications for example a meansend chain a¦b¦c contains two direct implications a¦b and b¦c each of which was explicitly stated by a consumer in the laddering interview in addition the meansend chain includes an indirect implication between a¦c which was not actually mentioned by a consumer but is implied by the two direct associations we combined both types of implications to produce a  x  implications matrix for each involvement group available from the first author the implications matrix accounts for all the direct and indirect relationships between a set of meansend concepts and thus accounts for the aggregate cognitive structure of the group although some subjects mentioned the same concept or implication more than once we counted each unique concept and association mentioned by a subject only once this avoided overweighting associations mentioned by verbose respondents who might mention an association between two concepts several times in the four ladders thus each unique link in a meansend chain received equal weight in the implication matrix the aggregate implications matrix for each involvement group was converted to a cognitive structure map by the laddermap program the program produces a graphic representation of the key attribute consequence and value concepts and the associations between them figures   and  present the cognitive structure maps for the low medium and high involvement groups respectively to simplify the maps we present only those connections mentioned by at least two consumers the format for the cognitive structure maps was suggested by gengler klenosky and mulvey  each meansend concept is represented by a circle white circles represent attributes grey circles represent consequences and black circles represent values the area of the circles are proportional to the percentage of subjects who mentioned the concept the thickness of the line segments is proportional to the percentage of subjects who linked the concepts both direct plus indirect associations a good cognitive structure map should account for most of the concepts and associations elicited by the laddering procedure and should be easy to interpret a minimum of crossing lines the cognitive structure map for low involvement consumers accounted for  of all direct and indirect relations while the maps for medium and high involvement consumers account for  and  of the relationships respectively results and discussion the purpose of this research was to explore differences in meansend knowledge structures for consumers with different levels of involvement we examined both the content and structure of meansend knowledge content refers to the specific meansend concepts mentioned by subjects while structure refers to the interrelationships between concepts both are necessary to understand the cognitive structure basis for involvement content of meansend knowledge first we examined whether the total number of unique concepts mentioned across the four ladders varied with level of involvement an analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of involvement hi med lo f p a scheffe test revealed significant differences between high involvement and both low and medium involvement but no differences between low and medium levels of involvement this result suggests that high involvement consumers activate more productrelated knowledge during decisionmaking than do medium and low involvement consumers this difference in knowledge content was reflected in the average length of the meansend chains high involvement subjects had somewhat longer chains on average than did low and medium involvement subjects hi med lo f p this suggests that high involvement subjects have better defined more complex or more complete meansend chains than less involved consumers do next we looked for differences in the types of knowledge concepts used to make decisions about tennis racquets we found no overall differences in the average number of attributes mentioned as choice criteria by subjects neither were there any differences in the average number of values linked to those product attributes perhaps because tennis racquets have a limited number of observable attributes tennis players regardless of their involvement know use about the same amount of attribute information likewise perhaps there is a limited number of values which one can satisfy in playing tennis whether one is an involved or casual player consumers did mention differing numbers of intermediate level consequence concepts in their laddering interviews high involvement subjects mentioned more unique consequences than the medium and low involvement consumers who did not differ hi med lo f p this suggests that highly involved subjects may have a better understanding of how specific product attributes influence their playing functional consequences and how these consequences will help them achieve their end goals values essentially the product knowledge structure for the highly involved subjects see figure  is more interconnected and complex as reflected in the greater number of linked consequences and the longer meansend chains the more complex meansend chains of highly involved consumers may be due to their greater product familiarity as they play more frequently and thereby learn which product attributes provide personally relevant consequences finally we examined whether specific meansend concepts at the attribute consequence and value levels were mentioned more often by a specific involvement group logistic regression was used to model the probability that a person would mention a certain concept given their level of involvement model fit was evaluated using the  log l statistic differences between the levels of involvement were evaluated using the maximum likelihood estimates see sas  as would be expected we observed more differences between involvement levels at the consequence level for instance qualitydurability was much more likely to be mentioned by low involvement consumers than high involvement consumers  versus  p on the other hand high involvement consumers were more likely to mention comfort in their meansend chains than moderate and lower involvement consumers  versus  and  p high involvement consumers also mentioned feel more often than less involved consumers  versus  and  and they mentioned concentrate more often  versus  and  p in both cases the attribute racket material was mentioned more often by highly involved consumers than less involved consumers p head size and brand name also differed in levels of mention p finally at the value level play my best was mentioned more often by highly involved consumers  than low involved consumers  p figure  hierarchical value map  low involvement structure of meansend knowledge next we compared the structural linkages between meansend concepts in the cognitive maps for the three involvement groups see figures   and  the overall knowledge structures for the three involvement groups are similar in many respects but there are interesting differences in meaning at the level of individual meansend chains for example low involvement consumers seem to have a simple meansend hierarchy they use brand name as the main cue to infer racket quality and durability high involvement consumers in contrast are less likely to use brand name as a cue for quality this does not necessarily mean that quality is less important to highly involved consumers rather unlike low involvement consumers who think about quality as a global abstract attribute highly involved consumers understand and articulate the specific meaning of what constitutes a high quality tennis racket thus high involvement consumers consider the head size grip and the material when evaluating a racket compared to their lower involvement counterparts high involvement consumers link these attributes to the benefits of comfort racket feel and ability to concentrate these factors in turn are seen as instrumental in achieving their key goal of playing theirbest figure  hierarchical value map  medium involvement figure  hierarchical value map  high involvement the content and structure of the other meansend chains vary across levels of involvement reflecting different levels and types of expertise for example low involvement consumers have a simple meansend chain associated with the attribute low weight they view low weight as a means of playing better so they can satisfy their end goal of fun  excitement in contrast high involvement consumers have a more complex chain of meaning associated with racket weight first low weight is seen as a means of making play more comfortable which produces better control which allows them to play better so they can win the end goal or value a second meansend chain linked weight to avoiding injury which allows the person to play more and to experience fun  excitement although these same concepts also appear on the low involvement cognitive map they are not connected to product attributes thus the meaning is not the same the same pattern occurs with other consequences such as confidence feel and comfort as mentioned earlier the thickness of the lines on the map represents the number of subjects who associated the linked concepts not only do high involvement consumers have more relationships between salient concepts but these relationships are stronger this phenomenon is particularly evident in the relationships between play better and the values of winning play my best and fun  excitement the greater number of lines represented on the maps of high involvement consumers reflects the greater complexity of their meansend knowledge structures compared to lower involvement consumers although this crosssectional study did not explore the development of meansend chains over time the results are suggestive apparently the knowledge structures of highly involved consumers have evolved to the point where most concepts are interrelated the rather subtle implications between many product attributes and functional consequences feel control comfort are appreciated by involved experts in addition end goals and values tend to be interconnected for the high involvement consumer we could speculate that highly involved consumers form a unit of selfrelevant goals and values associated with playing tennis such as winning play my best and fun  excitement perhaps the entire meansend structure relating productknowledge to these personallyrelevant consequences is activated for use during decisionmaking implications for future research the objective of this paper was to explore meansend knowledge structures associated with different levels of involvement of course the specific results have limited generalizability due to the subject group the sample size and the particular product and activity we examined our goal is to generate interest in studying involvement from a meansend perspective and stimulate future research aimed at understanding the cognitive basis for involvement the meansend knowledge structures provide much richer data about personal relevance or involvement than do broad measures such as pii which fail to provide insight into the underlying reasons for involvement it is possible for consumers to have equal levels of involvement measured by the pii but perceive the selfrelevance of the product in completely different ways knowledge of the basis for perceived selfrelevance is useful for many marketing applications for instance advertisements that communicate an entire chain of meaning rather than isolated facts and concepts are likely to be more effective gengler  reynolds and rochon  young and feigin  the present study is crosssectional further research is required to investigate how personal relevance the relationship between consumers and products develops over time we need to understand the evolution of involvement in terms of how product and self knowledge become linked with experience this will require longitudinal designs and individuallevel analyses rummelhart and normans  work on cognitive learning could be useful in designing such a study finally researchers should investigate how consumers use their meansend knowledge in tasks such as making decisions do they use individual concepts in a meansend chain as choice criteria or do they treat the entire meansend chain as a single unit of meaning hayesroth  suggested that complex knowledge structures may become unitized so that an entire meansend network of meaning could be represented by a shorthand representation of the meaning if so abstract concepts such as quality play better and value may be used as umbrella concepts that stand for the whole meansend chain of related concepts the challenge to researchers is to describe the unitization process uncover the conditions under which unitization occurs and develop methods of decomposing the unitized meaning once this is done we will have the means to develop a better understanding of how general concepts as quality and value are used by consumers in

suggestions for future research are offered introduction concepts such as product familiarity product experience or expertise andor prior information have been popular as mediating variables in many models of consumer behavior however despite the frequency with which product familiarity has been proposed as an individual difference variable affecting choice behavior the concept has not yet been clearly conceptualized in a compelling manner the resulting confusion is apparent in the variety of terms researchers have used to describe this general concept for example berelson and steiner  found that preexisting information was one of several predisposing factors in determining audience receptivity to congenial and noncongenial messages park  measured product familiarity in terms of subjects agreement with statements designed to operationalize howard and sheths  concepts of extensive limited and routinized problem solving based on the bayesian concept of prior distribution woodruff  used subjects evaluations of a brandattribute combination and their uncertainty about this rating to operationalize prior information about brand attributes laatovicka  measured knowledge about the product class by asking subjects if they could talk about a general group of products for a long time he also measured remembered personal experience by subjects responses to i can remember having purchased something in this general group of products raju and reilly  measured product familiarity in terms of subjects selfreported frequency of use overall familiarity and knowledge of how to select the best brand these studies exemplify the diverse and occasionally vague approaches taken in much of the past research on familiarity thus far this research has emphasized developing predictive models of consumer choice where measures of product familiarity are one element in such models unfortunately this approach has not produced a clear conceptualization of the construct of product familiarity the purposes of this paper are to propose a broad conceptualization of product familiarity defined in terms of the cognitive structures of product knowledge that are derived from past productrelated experiences and to present initial data regarding its usefulness and validity our broad objectives are to begin to develop a better understanding of how product experiences are represented in cognitive structure and of how cognitive structures influence the cognitive processes involved in handling product information eg making purchase choice decisions product familiarity as cognitive structure product familiarity has often been operationalized in terms of productrelated behavior perhaps most often in terms of selfreported product usage experience or frequency of use of anderson engledow and becker  jacoby chestnut and fisher  an information processing approach however provides a different perspective from this point of view the construct of interest is not the past product experience per se but the cognitive representations of that experience that are stored in memory see bettman  olson b russo and johnson  these representations can be considered to be organized in memory as a productrelated cognitive structure or schema product schemas contain knowledge in the form of coded representations of brands product attributes usage situations general product class information as well as evaluations and choice rules this coded information can be considered to be organized or linked together and stored in memory as a structural framework of knowledge norman and bobrow  thus product cognitive structures or schemas may contain not only factual knowledge about the product but also evaluations or affect and in well developed schemas purchase criteria and even decision rules or strategies olson a given this information processing perspective product familiarity can be defined in terms of consumers cognitive structures for a product that were presumably caused by various productrelated experiences consumers with different amounts or types of productrelated experience probably have acquired cognitive structures with differing characteristics these variations in cognitive structure are assumed to cause the observed behaviors previously attributed to the vague concept of product familiarity specific features or characteristics of cognitive structure are addressed later although this line of reasoning may be conceptually compelling it will not have much impact on our research unless we can develop reliable and valid measures which tap at least relatively directly these cognitive structures for products and brands before addressing operational issues however consider the developmental aspects of product familiarity effects of productrelated experiences on cognitive structure several authors have called for a theoretical explanation regarding how productrelated experiences create cognitive structures andor influence existing cognitive structures cf olson and mitchell  russo and johnson  hayesroth  presented such a conceptual framework which seems useful for considering the effects of product experience on cognitive structure see olson and dover  according to her model processing information about a product creates the elementary coded representations of knowledgethe concept nodes or cogitsof a product schema as more productrelated experiences occur these coded representations are strengthened in memory and associations between the knowledge nodes develop and become stronger ie learning occurs eventually presumably after multiple experiences with the product the configuration of associated representations has developed to a point that it can be considered a welldeveloped reasonably stable structure moreover substructures of the now welldeveloped schema may be recoded a chunking or unitization process cf miller  simon  by which several separate components of the cognitive structure come to be treated cognatively as a single representation thus this newly created concept or chunk represents several other concepts chunking can be considered as a process of forming abstract concepts by creating more general concepts to represent several more concrete concepts according to hayesroth  a chunk usually can be cognitively decomposed into its original components given appropriate instructions and processing although under ordinary circumstances it would be treated as a unitized representation consumers who are quite familiar with a product due to multiple past experiences might be expected to have formed a stable complex cognitive structure or set of structures of product knowledge perhaps containing multiple chunks olson and dover  at least one published study provides indirect support for the chunking propositions discussed above edell and mitchell  found that subjects with experimentallymanipulated prior experience regarding a previously unfamiliar product category generated fewer total thoughts in response to an advertisement for a brand in that product class than did subjects with little or no prior experience from the perspective discussed above the experienced subjects may have generated adstimulated thoughts about more abstract conceptschunks if you will bigger concepts with extra meaningand thus they produced fewer total responses certainly this interpretation is only speculative however as a partial test of this notion subjects cognitive responses could be analyzed in terms of their level of abstractness or concreteness effects of cognitive structure on information processing it is generally accepted that people use information from longterm memory to perceive interpret and store new information cf bettman  mitchell  olson b  from the perspective advocated here productrelated schemas are activated and provide the necessary cognitive structure for interpreting product information or new product experiences see olson a in this sense cognitive structures have a fundamental influence on the processes of attention encoding evaluating storing and using information for instance differences in memory schemas should be evidenced by variations in how consumers process information for which those cognitive structures are relevant whether the information is contained in ads for instance or is derived from product use experiences thus consumers cognitive responses to an advertisement wright  could provide clues about how cognitive structures influence encoding processes olson  in sum peoples existing cognitive structures should exert a powerful influence on their cognitive processes and on their subsequent overt behavior measuring cognitive structures perhaps the major stumbling block in doing research on cognitive structures is the measurement problem how does one measure the content and organization of a memory scheme for a product this issue is too large for a thorough discussion here briefly however olson b has advocated free elicitation as a possible measurement technique in this procedure subjects are given cue stimuli or memory probes usually words and asked to tell me everything that comes to mind when i say presumably the verbal responses elicited in response to product andor situationspecific probe cues can provide admittedly imperfect indicants of the content and perhaps the organization of cognitive structures russo and johnson  use a thought protocol task similar to free recall tasks and the free elicitation task used here but that may provide a somewhat different perspective on product cognitive structures in our research program thus far we have had some success with this technique see kanwar olson and sims  olson and muderrisoglu  a simple free elicitation procedure was used in this research to provide indices of two characteristics of a product cognitive structure research purpose the study described below serves only as an initial exploratory investigation of the ideas discussed above it is exploratory because the research was designed primarily for other purposes however part of the original design produced data that are relevant for our objective specifically there are two broad issues of major interest first what differences in cognitive structures result from varying levels of product experience or familiarity that is do our presumed measures of cognitive structure reflect differences in product familiarity second how do these cognitive structure variables effect subsequent information processing operations and the formation of product attitudes and purchase intentions methods product and subjects the product was an innovative office chair the chair had been designed to orthopedically accommodate and support the users body in a manner that would be both healthful and comfortable moreover the chair was intended to enhance the workers task performance while working at a desk the specific chair was totally unfamiliar to all subjects although it was being marketed in other regions of the country subjects consisted of  business students mostly mbas with some senior undergrads and  secretaries from the university subjects were volunteers selected on a convenience basis they were paid  for their participation design the part of the original study examined here can be represented as a simple  x  betweengroups design two levels of product experience or familiarity lower and higher were represented by the student and secretary groups the second factor was manipulated by exposing half of the subjects in each group on a random basis to a fairly elaborate sales promotion message for the desk chair the remaining subjects received no product message an afteronly design was used because taking preexposure measures was considered to be too sensitizing and besides subjects had no preexperimental knowledge of this particular chair that could be measured product familiarity  the main focus of interest is the cognitive structure representation of product familiarity to maximize inferential rigor it might have been preferable to experimentally manipulate familiarity and thus cognitive structure however it is difficult to create major differences in product familiarity and related cognitive structures in the context of a controlled experiment these variables develop naturally in the real world over relatively long periods of time and many experiences moreover for the initial studies in a program of research on cognitive structure it seemed most efficient to first establish whether differences in existing cognitive structures could be measured later after we learn more about cognitive structures we can make better attempts to manipulate them therefore we chose to use the secretary and student groups as a classification variable a surrogate manipulation of familiarity with office desk chairs it seemed reasonable to assume that secretaries have greater amounts of experience and familiarity with office desk chairs than do students exposure to product message  the second independent variable was exposure or not to a sales presentation for the new chair half of the subjects in each group saw a minute slide show of professional quality produced by the manufacturer and accompanied by a synchronized taperecorded sales presentation in the promotion message the product was presented as of high quality and innovative in design four major sales points were described verbally and portrayed visually the chair is accommodating to ones body health giving task motivating and comfortable procedures subjects were run individually to enhance their motivation and to provide a context for the experimental procedures subjects were told to imagine that they were part of an employee committee at their company which was to recommend the type and style of furniture to be used in a remodeling of their offices in fact the chair is sometimes sold in this way after completing an informed consent form subjects in the exposure condition were shown the slide show presentation immediately after they were asked to record all the thoughts you had while watching the presentation then concepts were elicited in response to three probe cues that were presented via the instruction tell me all the characteristics that come to mind when you think about buying an office desk  an office desk chair  a filing cabinet desk chair was always the second probe the interviewer recorded all responses verbatim following the third probe subjects rated their attitudes o and purchase intentions bi regarding the advertised chair the nonexposed subjects served as an internal control group to provide an index of peoples normative cognitive structure regarding the three probe cues uninfluenced by any persuasive message after completing the informed consent form these subjects received the free elicitation procedures no other measures were taken no cognitive responses o or bi dependent variables cognitive structure  to measure differences in cognitive structure due to variation in product familiarity we examined the results of the free elicitation instruction tell me all the characteristics that cone to mind when you think about purchasing an office desk chair empirical indicators of two cognitive structure characteristics were developed see kanwar slash and sims  the number of concepts elicited served as an indicator of cognitive structure dimensionality and the percentage of the elicited concepts judged more abstract rather than more concrete was used as a measure of abstractness of cognitive structure in another study we obtained adequate levels of agreement for these two judgments between two independent coders r   for total number of thoughts r   for judgment of abstract vs concrete see kanwar olson and sins  whether a concept was considered abstract or concrete was based on experimenter judgment significant differences in these indicators were expected between the secretary and the student groups due to their presumed differences in product experience however exposure to the promotional message might also produce some variation cognitive processing  immediately following the message subjects were given four minutes to write down the thoughts they had while watching the presentation these cognitive responses were coded in terms of the numbers of counterarguments support arguments and total thoughts produced as discussed earlier the cognitive responses of the more and less experienced groups were expected to vary because of their different productrelated cognitive structures attitude and intentions  attitude toward the chair o was measured by the mean of three bipolar point scales labeled goodbad high qualitylow quality and likedislike coefficient alpha   behavioral intention bi was measured on a point bipolar scale by asking the subjects how likely they would be to recommend purchase of the chair not at all likelyvery likely results and discussion check on familiarity classification intuitively it seemed reasonable to assume that secretaries by virtue of their daily experiences with office desk chairs would be more familiar with the general product class than students thus secretaries cognitive structures regarding desk chairs should be different from those of students to establish that their past experiences with desk chairs did indeed differ we asked both secretaries and students to report several past behaviors as expected  of the secretaries had worked at a job that involved desk work while only  of the students had moreover secretaries reported that  of their work time was spent working at a desk compared to  for those students who had ever had a desk job two independent judges agreed on  of these judgments differences in cognitive structure next it is important to establish that the secretarystudent distinction as a surrogate manipulation of product familiarity produced variation in our measures of cognitive structure empirically differences between secretaries and students might be reflected in a the total number of salient characteristics of desks elicited and b the level of abstraction of the elicited concepts moreover we need to determine whether or not exposure to the persuasive sales material influenced these elicitation measures to enhance the studys low power caused in part by the relatively small cell sizes ns   and  and because the exploratory nature of this research makes us relatively more sensitive to type ii than type i errors we adopted an alpha level of  for statistical significance cf cohen  a way familiarity by exposure anova showed that exposure to the sales promotion did not affect the number of concepts elicited p   ms   for exposed and  for not exposed respectively or the abstractness of the elicited concepts p   ms   and  although not statistically reliable the modest increase in abstract concepts due to exposure was to be expected since the sales promotion message did describe and portray several abstract ideas regarding the comfort healthfulness and accommodating properties of the chair that subjects probably were not aware of prior to message exposure the anova also revealed that the total number of elicitations for students was somewhat greater than that produced by the secretaries ms   vs  f   df   p  l this difference is consistent with the proposition that greater product familiarity results in the chunking of cognitive elements which in turn causes fewer verbalized responses to the elicitation probe implicit in this notion however is the requirement that those fewer chunked concepts represent higher levels of abstraction in fact the presumably less familiar students did produce a lower percentage of abstract concepts than did the secretaries but not significantly so ms   and  p   in sum the present data provide weak support that the surrogate manipulation of familiarity produced differences in cognitive structure parenthetically it might be noted that an office chair is not a highly complex product thus the degree of abstraction that logically can be expected may be somewhat limited if so the variance in the percentage of abstract concepts to be discovered might be rather small for a product of this type for more complex products differences in level of abstraction might be more apparent effects of cognitive structure and product message next we examine the effects that subjects cognitive structures had on their responses to the promotional material the following results are based only on those  students and  secretaries who were exposed to the sales promotion message cognitive responses  consistent with edell and mitchells  results and the chunking proposition we found that the presumably more experienced secretaries produced marginally fewer cognitive responses to the product promotion than the less experienced students ms   vs  f   df   p   secretaries produced no more support arguments than students ms   versus  p   but did have fewer counterarguments ms   versus  f   df   p   than the students these results provide weak support for the notion that cognitive processing of a product message is influenced by ones productrelated cognitive structures which in turn reflect differences in product familiarity by this perspective secretaries may possess better integrated more abstract and presumably more effective product structures therefore they might be expected to better understand and appreciate the rather complex information presented in the sales promotion massage since the product was convincingly described as of high quality secretaries would be expected to perceive it as such and support argue for the message which they did although not significantly more so than students moreover secretaries would not be expected to find as many points with which to disagree in the apparently accurate product message in contrast students with lesswell developed productrelated schemas may not have clear criteria on which to judge the product thus they might be expected to have some difficulty in relating the information in the advertisement to their personal experiences if so they would be more likely to disagree with the information and produce more counterarguments which they in fact did alternatively however students may simply have been more cynical or critical than the secretaries or may have felt greater demands to appear critical during the experimental task attitude and intentions toward the chair  cognitive responses especially counterarguments have been shown to mediate the formation of attitudes and intentions eg olson toy and dover  wright  therefore it was expected that the secretaries would be more likely than the students to perceive the chair as being of high quality and to recommend its purchase this was indeed the case secretaries had more favorable product attitudes than the students ms   versus l f   df   p   and consistent with their more positive attitudes toward the chair secretaries were more likely than students to recommend purchase of the chair ms   vs  f   df   p   these results lend additional credence to the presumed casual flow between cognitive responses attitudes and intentions cf edell and mitchell  olson toy and dover  wright  conclusions and suggestions like many initial investigations of new conceptualizations and measures the present research generates more questions than it answers the papers basic value is probably in raising the issue of how product familiarity is to be treated as a construct in consumer behavior theory although weak we believe that the pattern of obtained results are sufficiently interesting to warrant further investigation although the present data were derived from a larger study primarily intended to address other issues this does not invalidate the obtained results in particular the elicitations were carried out about as we would do in a study specifically designed to investigate cognitive structure issues there are however problems in interpreting the product familiarityexperience studentsecretary factor because levels of familiarity were not manipulated a variety of other differences exist between the two groups besides their past experiences with desk chairs these confoundings become serious if one or more of these other factors can account for the observed pattern of results a series of internal analyses revealed that neither age nor sex nor marital status could consistently account for the obtained results a stronger rival explanation involves the experimental demand characteristics that may have been felt by the secretary subjects perhaps the secretaries felt that they were expected to react favorably to the positive information provided by the advertisement because they had job experience with the product class while this could account for their favorable attitudes and purchase intentions it is not clear why students would not also feel obligated to react favorably additionally if the secretaries felt that their expertise was an issue it seems likely that they would have sought other ways to demonstrate their expertise thus compared to students the secretaries should have produced more not fewer verbal elicitations and more not less counterarguments in response to the product message perhaps the most compelling alternative explanation for the elicitation results is that studentsespecially mba studentsare rather verbal and therefore likely to produce more concepts in a free elicitation task than secretaries this explanation however cannot account for the other effects that were obtained for instance why should high verbalness have a negative effect on o or bi in summary although of course it cannot be proposed with high confidence the most parsimonious explanation for the entire range of obtained results is that members of the two groups had different cognitive structures interestingly a similar study recently published by anderson and jolson  obtained some of the same patterns of results as found here they found that advertisements for mm cameras containing relatively technical information produced more favorable beliefs and attitudes for more experienced consumers than for less experienced consumers we would hypothesize that greater product experience produced more complex cognitive structures containing abstract concepts chunks and strong clear interrelationships between concepts such memory schemas seem necessary in order to comprehend complex information in a meaningful way stated simply complex information is mere persuasive for people who are able to more fully comprehend it future research directions this study introduces the idea of conceptualizing product familiarity product experience and product expertise in terms of the cognitive structures produced by past product experience clearly additional theorizing and empirical research is necessary before this conceptualization can be generally accepted for use in other research in particular we need a more explicit model of cognitive structure what are the relevant characteristics of a product cognitive structure or memory schema what measures can serve as empirical indicators of these constructs how do these aspects of cognitive structure affect other cognitive processes such as the encodingcomprehension process or the information integration processes involved in judgment or decision making in short how is past experience represented in a cognitive structure answers to such questions will require an extensive research program focused on the construct validity of a model of cognitive structure we have begun such a program cf olson and dover  olson and muderrisoglu  olson and sims  which recently has produced signs of progress kanwar olson and sims  thus far we have proposed three characteristics of cognitive structure dimensionality the number of salient concepts scored in memory articulation the number of discriminable categories along each dimension and abstraction the level of abstractness of the dimensions in addition to free elicitations the repertory grid procedure and a knowledge test appear to provide potential measures of these cognitive structure elements see kanwar olson and sims  these developments also indicate a need for further improvements in methodology in order to facilitate further research on cognitive structure the first stage of future research could use the three cognitive structure characteristics just mentioned to establish the aspects of cognitive structure that are related to varying degrees of product familiarity it does not seem important at this time to attempt the actual manipulation of product familiarity rather we should establish the differences in structure that are associated with differences in experience presumably the constructs of dimensionality articulation and abstraction vary not only across levels of familiarity but also for types of products if so of course the data patterns obtained in this preliminary research may not hold for very simple or very complex products future research should attempt to replicate the present design in order to establish the generalizability of these results for instance differences in cognitive structures should be found between groups of subjects who a priori have different hopefully more extreme levels of product familiarity for several products of varying complexity once this step is accomplished it is necessary to demonstrate that the measured differences in cognitive structure are related to differences in information processing behavior to attitudes and behavioral intentions and to overt behavior while experimental simulations are useful for much of this research actual field observations in a natural environment will be necessary to establish external validity finally research should focus on the developmental aspects of product familiarity created by product experience or consumer socialization or consumer education essentially in a longitudinal study subgroups of subjects could be brought to various levels of product familiarity through product experience both cognitive and behavior measures which presumably would possess known reliabilities and validities by this rims should reflect the levels of product familiarity in sum a wide variety of interesting questions regarding the cognitive structure representation of product familiarity can be addressed once we have suitable criterion measures of course these questions have not been answered by the present research we have merely introduced the idea of conceptualizing product experience and product familiarity in terms of cognitive structure and have produced some data that point to the potential usefulness of this point of view we hope that others will become interested in developing these concepts and measurement procedures

abstractprice nonprice product information and purchase intention together with the intervening variables of perceived price perceived quality and perceived value are empirically examined the results indicate that perceived price is positively influenced by objective price and negatively influenced by reference price they support the positive priceperceived quality relationship found in previous studies and further show that the influence of price on perceived quality is lessened in the presence of substantial direct product information finally the results demonstrate that a tradeoff between perceived price and perceived quality leads to perceived value and perceived value is a primary factor influencing purchase intention baron reuben m and david a kenny  the moderatormediator variable
