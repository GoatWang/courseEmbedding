chief financial officer of illumina—a global life science company that develops manufactures and markets life science tools and systems for analysis of genetic variation and function—four lessons have helped prepare him for his role don’t waste the moments that matter make tough decisions learn your business inside and out and never compromise on hiring talented people mr stapley promotes the virtue of being low maintenance and describes one of the cfo’s roles as making life easier for the ceo the board of directors fellow executives and employees speaking at deloitte’s next generation cfo academy he added “there’s nothing that finance can’t touch any opportunity you see to make something more effective solve a problem or prevent a conflict should be a top priority” q when you became cfo at illumina in  it was your first cfo position did you feel fully prepared marc stapley marc stapley yes but i knew there were a few areas where i wanted to develop my strengths and fill in some gaps the first was in investor relations i started to focus on this when i attended the deloitte cfo next generation academy four years ago as my direct contact with wall street was limited at that point before becoming cfo i don’t think i had an appreciation for how knowledgeable and strategic those in the investment community were and even how different their terminology could be i was amazed by how well investors knew the business and the industry and how skilled they were at assimilating information the second gap was dealing with the board of directors in my previous position i had attended one board meeting and two audit committee meetings which represented the extent of my board experience fortunately the failed hostile takeover of illumina by roche which commenced just one day after i joined the company threw me into hundreds of investor meetings and dozens of board meetings in just the first two months of my tenure another gap was fully understanding illumina’s business including the science behind it i had to learn the basics of biology—that dna consisted of four bases—a c t and g—something my kids learned in seventh grade to be effective i committed to learning all aspects of our business not just about the finances but the science and biology that serves as the foundation for genetics q how do you see the cfo’s role with respect to influencing company strategy marc stapley the cfo not only has a key role in setting the strategy for the company but also in executing that strategy he or she needs to have the courage of conviction to challenge something that he or she doesn’t feel is right for the company strategically but it’s also important to be supportive once there is agreement on a strategy for example we had an acquisition a few years ago over which the management team spent some time debating i had my position and voiced my views at the end of the day we decided to make the acquisition and at that point everyone was supportive irrespective of their initial position it turned out to be a great decision for us so once you’ve had all the dialogue and the decisions have been made it’s important for cfos to be a staunch supporter you’re lucky if you ever get a unanimous management team around big strategic shifts in a company and it’s rare to find every executive and every board member agreeing all of the time management teams executives and boards need to be allowed to have candid conversations but the outcomes need to be owned by the management team when a decision has been made q which leadership traits have you found to be effective marc stapley i’ve worked for seven companies in my time and there are four rules that have worked for me in every single company the first is respect people who work with you and for you and respect the skills and experience they bring to their position the second is always give the benefit of the doubt a cfo must have a healthy amount of skepticism and while you do need to trust you should always verify while giving the benefit of the doubt always assume the best intentions unless you have a good reason not to the third trait is to be low maintenance as cfo one of your jobs is to make your ceo’s job easier to make the board’s job easier and to make your fellow executives and employees’ job easier there’s nothing that finance can’t touch any opportunity you see to make something more effective solve a problem or prevent a conflict you should take on finally my favorite one—transparency which means a lot of things to me integrity trust honesty and accountability i believe in transparency with stakeholders at all times that’s not the same thing as unfiltered candor i’m talking about transparency with sensitivity to your audience and to the situation you’re in it’s one of the best things you can do in terms of earning people’s trust and that works with investors it works with the board it works with management i’ve yet to find situations where it doesn’t work well q how have you found working for a relatively smaller organization compared to the larger organizations you have been with marc stapley it’s really not that different the challenges are similar albeit the scale is different it is easier to get your arms around a smaller organization and some might feel you can be more impactful but i’ve always felt that i was able to have an impact at the larger organizations that i’ve been fortunate to work with it’s actually working for a high growth organization that presents the most differences and that was one of the reasons that i came to illumina having spent  years helping large organizations transform their income statement interestingly though one thing is similar but for a different reason and that’s the resource challenge in high growth the work comes in faster than you can grow the workforce whereas in transforming businesses the work doesn’t go away fast enough as the workforce is declining either way there’s the perpetual challenge of getting more done with fewer people and that’s something cfos need to help the entire organization to balance q what advice do you have for those aspiring to the cfo post marc stapley make tough decisions be prepared to take some risks personally and professionally life is full of tough decisions for example leaving pfizer for illumina and moving from the east coast to the west coast was the hardest decision my family and i ever had to make even harder than moving from the united kingdom to the united states but it was a great decision you’ve got to have no regrets you’ve got to try different things and think longer term second learn your business inside and out to do that you’ve really got to be passionate about it and i don’t mean just the financials i mean every aspect of the business cfos can and should ask questions and they might precede it with “this is probably a stupid question but…” a cfo will be able to connect operational cause and financial effect much more effectively if he or she knows the ins and outs of the business it has made me far more effective at doing my job third don’t compromise on hiring great people it’s very tempting to compromise especially when there might be a perceived talent shortage but you must refrain getting the aplayer is going to put you in very good stead so always identify and seek the best talent fourth learn how to challenge appropriately and never blindside people a nosurprise approach has always worked for me if there are issues work with your leader or colleagues to address them and be transparent in your approach if someone aspiring to be cfo follows those four guideposts i think he or she will do incredibly well editor’s note this article is part of an ongoing series of

in driving growth often that means looking to other countries for new market opportunities leading an international growth effort challenges cfos to tailor the capabilities they need to operate in a domestic market to the unique aspects of operating globally says charles holley retired cfo of walmart and an independent senior advisor to deloitte he discusses what it takes to lead global expansion from the cfo’s seat and describes practices he found helpful in leading international growth capital allocation decisions bringing the board of directors on board continued uncertainty about the economy and increased regulation across several industries have required a more informed and efficient use of capital working with management the board of directors can play a fundamental role in the capital allocation process through its oversight function including participating in strategy development examining risks comparing strategy to results and focusing on key investment terms understand how boards can help guide the capital allocation process by challenging business plans and strategy and reviewing capital allocation alternatives among other efforts stressed out how business chemistry can help you and your team the deloitte greenhouse™ experience team recently surveyed more than  professionals about their stress levels at work and matched their responses to their business chemistry® type knowing which employees are experiencing the most stress can have implications for productivity health and performance by viewing stress through the lens of business chemistry cfos can help their team not only cope effectively with stress but maybe even reframe it as a catalyst for better ways of working and like other senior business leaders cfos have to keep their own stress levels in check views  analysis four ways cfos can avoid a digital talent crunch technology is redefining how work gets done both in the back office and in frontline operations while the rapid growth of digital technologies creates new opportunities for finance it also creates the potential for a digital divide if members of the finance team lack the necessary skillsets and business acumen they may not be able to make the most of these new digital capabilities learn how cfos can help their organization advance its digital efforts by focusing on leadership culture skills development and engagement keeping finance talent relevant to changing needs charles holley cfoinresidence it’s no secret that talent is key to a cfo’s success yet talent is a perennial top challenge for cfos that’s partly due to the continually changing definition of what it means to have a talented finance team says charles holley an independent senior advisor to deloitte drawing on his extensive leadership experiences he explains how to identify recruit and develop the people best suited for the fastchanging demands of finance the key he says is finding the best athletes and keeping their capabilities relevant and aligned to the needs of the business fpa why talent counts and what cfos can do to improve it to elevate the strategic contribution that a finance organization’s fpa team can make cfos should focus on developing the team’s technical professional and leadership competencies specifically they can use a fourpart model that provides opportunities to gain education and experience with exposure to key decisionmakers and the expectation that fpa will function more strategically rotating talent from fpa into the business and back again can also help team members acquire both a broader understanding of the organization and the specialized knowledge that can make this function integral to the organization’s success editors choice leading business transformation at the speed of tech kelly kramer cisco cfo leading a major business transformation from the cfo seat takes strategic vision a close partnership with the ceo and business leaders and a finance team with a changeagent

managing director deloitte services lp ms kramer also discusses how she’s developing finance talent and the importance of a strong financeit relationship new market dynamics bring change to cfo searches the disruption characterizing the business climate appears to be spilling into the cfo job market impacting what companies seek in their next cfo and how they conduct their searches according to jenna fisher who leads the global corporate officers sector at executive search firm russell reynolds associates she discusses a host of recent trends she is seeing in cfo searches including rising interest in “best athlete” candidates and those with global and strategysetting experience a decrease in internal cfo promotions and an increase in confidential searches china spotlight how cfos can monitor and mitigate directional shifts in china’s currency—an update changing dynamics in china’s currency policy and market volatility continue to add to uncertainty on the direction of the renminbi

murphy kmaxwellmurphy jan    pm et  comments illumina set a high bar in its search for a new finance chief which is why it took twoandahalf years to land pfizer’s marc stapley stapley  was most recently pfizer’s senior vice president in charge of global finance and helped the drug giant digest its acquisitions of wyeth and king pharmaceutical and before pfizer he worked at alcatellucent and was the francoamerican telecommunication company’s cfo for its americas region the maker of genetic testing systems is at an inflection point in its corporate life which made it difficult to find the right person for that job it has matured from a development stage company with less than  million of annual revenue a decade ago to being on pace to report  billion in sales a year and is growing both organically and through acquisition that size company is big enough to warrant having a cfo with largecompany experience but it’s not large enough to offer career advancement possibilities to the sitting cfo of another large company illumina chief executive jay flatley told cfo journal the company needed someone with “largecompany experience” as illumina is growing rapidly and most of its management team including flatley spent the balance of their careers at startups also illumina typically makes three to five “small to moderate” acquisitions a year he said so a cfo with merger experience was key flatley said illumina’s san diego headquarters made finding a new cfo even more difficult san diego is known for being home to many biotechnology firms but most of those companies are development stage and illumina wasn’t interested in cfos from those however sitting cfos at companies with market capitalizations larger than illumina’s roughly  billion are hard to poach he said ruling many of them out as candidates and for some promising candidates who are married with children san diego itself was a dealbreaker despite the city’s beautiful beaches flatley said because they didn’t want to relocate their families stapley starts on jan  and flatley said he’ll help the company figure out the best way to structure its balance sheet and evaluate uses of cash like share repurchases while helping illumina set up a new system to manage its global supply chain inventory and resources that will allow current cfo christian henry to focus all of his attention on his primary role general manager of illumina’s genetic analysis business flatley praised henry’s financial acumen which he said made it easier for illumina to take its time in finding the right permanent fit goldman sachs analyst isaac ro praised stapley’s hire and said in a wednesday research note that the firm believes “this key hire reduces execution risk at illumina and brings the potential for more sophisticated operations and financial oversight as the company continues to grow” ro said goldman sachs’s investigations into stapley suggest he was “well regarded” at pfizer and “his areas of expertise included a range of operational responsibilities with a focus on global taxtrade and systems migration” goldman sachs believes stapley will help with illumina’s expansion into new businesses and with its use of capital as “capital deployment becomes more critical to the investment outlook” about the only thing stapley lacks that illumina had on its prospectivecfo checklist flatley said is investor relations experience though it might take some time for stapley to get to know the investment community there’s no urgency as illumina is “very well funded” and doesn’t need to raise cash flatley said stapley’s annual base salary will be  according to a filing with the securities and exchange commission and he’ll earn a signing bonus of  that he gets to keep as long as he doesn’t quit or get fired for “gross negligence or misconduct” during his first year he’ll also get  restricted shares that vest over four years and would be worth about  if they vested today along with options to buy  illumina shares that vest over four years henry’s salary for the fiscal year ended in january  was  in addition to stock and option awards valued at  million and a  cash bonus for total compensation of  million share this illumina marc stapley previous the morning ledger kodak turns focus to bankruptcy next southern co cfo bullish on expansion plans dividends content from our sponsor
