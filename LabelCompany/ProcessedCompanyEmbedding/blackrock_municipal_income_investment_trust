standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the motif and is measured in a range from low to high since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk a volatility measurement that is high is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk the valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market the valuation metric is calculated as the composite pricetoearnings ratio for the stocks in the
