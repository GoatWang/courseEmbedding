early age he started his success story in  when with  borrowed from his father he opened a small store in his wifes hometown of nashville arkansas by that time he had better than  years of parttime and summer experience working in his fathers mineral springs arkansas store after completing college university of arkansas and graduate school columbia university school of business mr dillard began working as a management trainee for sears roebuck  company shortly after completing the training course a period of only seven months mr dillard left sears and opened his first store even in the beginning mr dillard was well aware of the value of effective advertising in building a business with each moveexpansion the company has stressed value in its advertising aside from a short period during world war ii the company continued operating and expanding its nashville location in  dillard looking for more growth prospects sold the nashville store and used the money along with some outside financing to buy controlling interest in a texarkana artx store his competitive strategy was to offer attractively priced national name brand merchandise along with customer credit by  it was the leading store in texarkana from texarkana dillard expanded to tyler texas in  with the purchase of an existing store in early  he entered into a similar transaction for a tulsa oklahoma store which was twice the size of the now thriving tyler operation like his other acquisitions he was quick to make it profitable and to pay down acquisitionrelated debt the department store operator opened his first store in a shopping mall in  in austin tx a decision which proved to have significant implications in the chains future growth strategy one of the cornerstones of dillards philosophy is that location is the key to success meanwhile the company had established a credit subsidiary purchased two central arkansas department store chains relocated its headquarters to little rock arkansas implemented a centralized computer system realigned its capital structure and used its existing store base as a vehicle for expansion into mall locations throughout the late sixties and beyond this aggressive mall expansion would continue in  dillard department stores inc went public offering its class a common stock to eager investors for the first time on may  by the early s the chain had moved into louisiana missouri and new mexico and had expanded its presence in texas arkansas and oklahoma thus necessitating a divisional organization within the parent company in  the purchase of five stores from tandys leonards division gave dillard a strong foothold in the dallasfort worth market further consolidation in the department store industry made possible for dillard many smaller acquisitions until  then just five days after announcing the second two forone stock split dillard’s announced the acquisition of stix baer  fuller consisting of  stores located in the st louis and

consisting of  units in the south the following year the jb ivey chain was purchased  stores spanning north carolina south carolina and florida in  the last storewide sales event was eliminated as dillard’s moved to a more balanced pricing approach this pricing strategy was designed to help create loyalty and confidence among dillard’s customers the year was also marked with the acquisition of  maison blanche stores in northern and western florida acquisition activity slowed from  to  as properties became less available the company turned its focus to construction and expansion constructing over  stores in  dillard’s again entered the acquisition arena and purchased ten mervyn’s stores in florida seven proffitt’s locations in virginia and three macy’s stores in houston texas on may

merchandise but has been forced to discount by its lowerend competitors hopes its move up market will stop the markdowns the shift in product alignment might help stave off the onslaught on the
