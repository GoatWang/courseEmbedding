brian harris brian harris thank you kelly im pleased to report that in the first quarter ladder produced core earnings nongaap measure of  million or  per share this resulted in an annualized after tax return on equity of  we originated a total of  million of loans in the quarter of which  million of the total are held for securitization with a weighted average mortgage interest rate of  while  million of the total will be held on our balance sheet with an average rate of  at the end of the first quarter we held  million in loans for securitization and we added  million more at this point into the second quarter we held a total of  billion in balance sheet loans at the end of the quarter with an additional  million closed in the second quarter we expect to return to the securitization market in the second quarter although we are still evaluating which approach to take towards newly implemented risk retention rules we have several choices and all seem attractive but we are taking great care to choose the right path that will produce the best results for our shareholders the first quarter was a workman like quarter with almost all of our earnings coming from leases and net interest margin and very little attributed to gain on sale of assets that we have while most of our earnings in the quarter were from passive income the quarter was filled with a flurry of corporate finance activities that materially broadened our shareholder base strengthened our balance sheet and enhanced our ability to grow in the years ahead when we began the new year we executed the first part of a forecasted plan to refinance  million of our corporate bonds with a rate of  percent prepayable at par in april of  as we approach the end of  we began to sell down our securitys portfolio lowering leverage and raising cash so we would be able to pay off our highest rate corporate bonds regardless of what market conditions might be in the first quarter of  after tumultuous three months following the presidential election we were pleased to be met with a welcoming bond market and successfully raised  million from the sale of unsecured corporate bonds at a rate of  we refinanced our  bonds and borrowed an additional  million at a rate that was over  lower than our first offering just four and a half years ago we also extended by two years and upsized our corporate revolver by  million and also added turn to several of our other credit facilities these events were clear endorsements by various lenders and investors as to the strength of ladders balance sheet our flexible business model and our conservative management style in addition to the accretive steps we took on liability side of our balance sheet we also took steps to broaden our equity shareholder base after initial investors in ladder sold  million shares in our first secondary market sale in december we followed that up in february with another strong endorsement when related companies purchased  of our outstanding shares in a private transaction and named a member to our board we followed that transaction with another secondary market sale in march of approximately  million worth of shares each success of secondary sale of stock was executed at a higher price per share than a transaction preceding it ladder receive no proceeds from these three secondary sales but the sales greater improved our average daily volume of shares traded making our stock more investible for large institutional long term investors who need better liquidity in the stocks that they own in terms of general market conditions its worth noting that a trend that we’ll be keeping an eye on according to one industry publication the first quarter of  saw united states cmbs issuance of  billion down from  billion in the first quarter of  and dramatically lower than the  billion in the first quarter of  this decline in securitization volume is meaningful and there are probably several reasons for it including the implementation of risk retention rules in december of  many originators that are not capitalized to hold interest in their loans for long periods of time have simply left the business while others are struggling to find workable solutions regardless of what solutions others come up with ladder has numerous solutions available to us to take advantage of any market disruptions caused by risk retention our strong credit culture combined with our permanent capital base will allow us to thrive in the recently less competitive loan to securitization business our diversified suite of investment products allows us to shift our capital around as the business climate changes in todays market a flat yield curve makes investments in short duration securities less attractive to us as evidenced by our lower inventory of securities today versus where we were two quarters ago although the last two quarters we sold  million of securities at an average gain on sale of  not a very big profit margin but this is due to the short duration of our securities portfolio which also experiences less price volatility as interest rates fluctuate since our securities portfolio is the safest and most liquid product in our inventory it also employs the greatest amount of leverage by selling a large portion of our securities over the last two quarters we also reduced our leverage at ladder at the end of the first quarter our debt to equity ratio was  times an important item here is worth mentioning when we issued  million in unsecured corporate bonds in the middle of march there was a period of about two weeks where we still had our s bonds outstanding as a result we showed a debt to equity ratio of  at the end of the quarter but this dropped in the first week of april to  after we paid off the outstanding  million of our s bonds while we lowered our inventory of securities our bridge loan product continued to be one of the more attractive profit centers and we are focusing on that today against the backdrop of bank regulation and a relative lack of competition for loans where cash flows at the property level are depressed due to several factors we are seeing robust demand for loans that we hold on our balance sheet secured by these transitional properties in  our first mortgage bridge loan inventory contributed  million of core earnings in the first quarter versus  million in the first quarter of last year we continue to see strong demand for this product and while we expect market forces to create more competition in this space we feel we are differentiated enough in our approach to this business to maintain strong profitability with that said let me now turn you over to marc fox marc fox thank you brian i will now review ladder capital’s financial results for the quarter ended march   ladder generated core earnings of  million in the first quarter of  this amount compares to  million in the first quarter of the prior year core eps for the first quarter was  per share compared to  per share for the same quarter of year ago on an after tax core basis ladder generated  return on average equity during the first quarter down from  in the first quarter of  this is based on an average equity balance excluding noncontrolling interest of consolidated joint ventures of approximately  billion on a gaap basis ladder generated net income before taxes of  million during q ’ this compares favorably to a net loss before taxes of  million for the comparable period in  net results of derivative transactions our interest rate hedge gains and losses were the major cause of the swing from loss to profit in this yearoveryear gap comparison in the first quarter of  interest rates changed only slightly resulting in a  million gaap hedging loss attributable to hedging interest in comparison to the first quarter of  when both the five and  year swap rates declined by over  basis points resulting in  million of gaap hedging losses this quarters  million of core earnings were achieved without the benefit of any securitization gains and less than  million of core gains from real estate and security sales the remaining core earnings were derived from ladders solid foundational investment that generated recurring income in excess of ladders total corporate expenses during the quarter recurring net interest net rental and fee income contributed  million to core earnings these recurring revenues were more than  times the remaining core corporate expenses of  million incurred during the quarter in other words in the first quarter ladder generated over  million of recurring core earnings net of corporate expenses the largest gap to core earnings adjustment for the quarter related to real estate depreciation on a yearoveryear basis first quarter  results were aided by  million of gains on the extinguishment of corporate debt and  million of securitization gains net of hedging that together more than account for the difference versus q  core earnings during the first quarter of  ladder originated total of  million of loans to not participate in a securitization transaction as conduit loans were being aggregated in anticipation of a future transaction i’ll now review ladders income statement and balance sheet interest income was  million in the first quarter of  compared to  million in the same quarter of  net rental income which includes operating lease income and tenant recoveries net of real estate operating expenses of  million in the first quarter was comparable for the net rental income earned during the same period in  ladders portfolio of loans held for sale or conduit loans stood at  million at the end of the first quarter up over  from the end of last year reflecting new loan origination activity during the first quarter similarly ladders portfolio of loans held for investment or balance sheet loans increased over  to  billion from the end of  ladders portfolio of cmbs and us agency securities investments decreased to  billion as of the end of march from  billion at december   as we sold a total of  million of securities experienced amortization and prepayments of  million and purchased  million of securities during the quarter as noted previously the net securities decrease is indicative of ladders move to reallocate capital between our business lines specifically from investments in securities to newly originated loans with regard to real estate our total real estate portfolio as of march   stood at  million during the first quarter ladder acquired three properties for a total price of  million bringing our portfolios total square footage to  million square feet in terms of key balance sheet metrics as of march    of our debt investment assets were senior secured including first mortgage loans and commercial mortgage backed securities secured by first mortgage loans which is consistent with the senior secured focus of the company senior secured assets plus cash comprise  of our total asset base total unencumbered investments including cash were  billion and our unencumbered assets to unsecured debt ratio was  based on the terms of the  million of senior notes issued in march of this year in reviewing our march   balance sheet you will note that it reflects a balance of  billion of senior notes which includes the addition of  million of the new senior notes as well as  million of senior notes that were set to mature in the fourth quarter of this year that ladder prepaid right after quarter end on april rd as brian noted the average coupon on the loans held for sale originated in the first quarter was  compared to  in the preceding quarter the average coupon on the loans held for investment originated in the quarter reflected a weighted average spread of approximately  over onemonth libor versus  spread last quarter the weighted average loantovalue ratio of the commercial real estate loans on our balance sheet at  was approximately  slightly lower than the weighted average ltvs in recent quarters with regard to securities  of our securities positions were rated aaa or backed by agencies of the us government as of quarter end all of our cmbs positions were rated investment grade the weighted average duration of our securities portfolio was  year or  months slightly higher than the average duration of  months at the end of the same quarter last year but lower than the  month average duration at the end of the prior year ladder ended the quarter with total assets of  billion and total equity of  billion our core leverage increased to  from  during the quarter impacted by the addition of new loan investments during the quarter and the inflation of other assets related to the bond payoff on april rd excluding the impact of this bond payoff our core debt to equity ratio would have been  times with regard to financing we continued to enhance our maturity profile while maintaining a diverse set of funding sources as of march   we had  billion of core debt outstanding and committed financing availability of over  billion for additional investments our fhlb borrowings stood at  billion as of march   in addition to the successful  million five year unsecured bond issuance and the prepayment of the higher coupon bond that was scheduled mature on october ladder also strength its capital base in other ways during the first quarter we added a new bank to our unsecured revolving credit facility which was extended and expanded to over  million reflecting the new bank’s contribution as well as increased commitments from two other syndicate numbers with regard to our committed secured loan repurchase facilities since december   ladder has expanded the final maturity dates of two of those facilities as brian discussed ladder also announced two secondary offerings of class a common stock on behalf of some of the original investors and partners in the firm and we continue to negotiate facility expansions and additional financing sources for our loan and our securities portfolios so summing up in the first quarter ladder generated  million of core earnings and a core after tax return on average equity of  over the first three months of the year during a period of no securitization activity we continue to cover a  per share of cash dividend during the quarter issued  million of  senior notes due in  and the proceeds we used in part to repay bonds with an interest rate of s percent and we continued to apply a disciplined approached the use leverage to the allocation of capital on the phase of risk reencounter until selection of longer term investments in loans and real estates at this point its time to open the line for questions and answers questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instruction the first question comes from ben zucker with jmp securities please go ahead ben zucker i heard your comments about closing another  million of conduit loans subsequent to quarter end but i think i miss the second part where you might have mentioned the held for investment originations too could you just repeat those numbers for me brian harris at the end of the quarter for balance sheet loans is that your question ben zucker yes brian harris we held  billion and as of yesterday we had closed an additional  million in the second quarter so far ben zucker and based on your commentary brian i kindly got the question that you guys are a little less certain that you will issue your own securitization in the second quarter am i hearing you correctly and if i am what is changed since the last fall when it seemed like ladder securitization was a little more profitable perhaps brian harris i think you’re hearing something that’s not being said ben zucker okay brian harris so nothing has really changed but keep in mind we’re certainly open few changes we just havent really made any yet though ben zucker really quickly turning to the property segment is there any update that you could give on the condo development project that i think is held in the joint venture down on second half how that’s progressing and when do you think sales might be occurring there brian harris i know that they’ve got some presales done i think they sold three of the units but we’re not really open yet and showing i think those are friends and family and i walk by the other day its actually very close to nyu so i happen to be there and walk by relatively comfortable as you know we do have some concerns about high end condominiums because of whats going on in the uber high end area but these don’t really compete with us there is a light amenity package and they are all about the same size its not a pent house heavy situation so as of now we’re pretty comfortable with where we are i think its only  units ben zucker and then just lastly from a high level could you touch on the competition i think we’ve heard a lot about just the increase in capital chasing these kinds of loans and maybe some competitive pressure weighing on coupons could you comment if you’re seeing the same thing there brian harris i think there two things going on in the lending area as far as competitors go i think the conduit business is actually getting less competitive and that’s because i remember a year and year and half ago we’re talking about how many people were in the business and all the volume but i think risk retention has seemed to hurt a little bit there in the conduit side and while lending at large is smaller and i don’t think that’s unique to us or the reits i think the banks are experiencing the same thing so im at somewhat of a loss as to explain as to why lending volumes are not very strong however almost everything that’s written is reasonable as far as credit goes were not seeing a lot of credit large or lack of discipline there and most of it is reasonably profitable also at least as of now so were not seeing any thought leaders trying to pick up volume at great costs to themselves or risk so the conduit business is smaller but healthy and i would say on the bridge loan side there have been several new operations put into place recently and may be a couple of more coming i think most of them are geared towards the larger loans i think from what i’ve been hearing we are not experiencing too much in the way of competitive pressure in the bridge loan portfolio except as we get up towards  million but then we’ll start to feel the pressures from some of the competitors that you know as well as some hedge funds and as well some new startup operations but our portfolio we originated i think it was almost  million in the quarter at an average rate of  that’s actually at a higher rate than last year somewhat reflecting libor so again volume there is okay its not terribly competitive because there aren’t a lot of banks in that area but we are seeing some hedge funds and some leverage loan funds getting quite competitive in the over  million area but we don’t really hang around in that neighborhood operator the next question is from jessica leviribner with fbr please go ahead jessica leviribner brian i know you just talked a little bit about the pipeline for the second quarter and i appreciate your comments around the transactions in the bridge lending space but can you size your pipeline for the coming quarter and then may be give us an idea of the types of loans you made this quarter brian harris well i know the pipeline i know its under application right now and its reasonably strong however i have to take to share that with you because one or two loans could change that if they were to fall down for some reason so i would just call it reasonably active not blowing the doors off but certainly doing fine against the current rate environment i would say were probably originating at a pace in the second quarter that’s slightly ahead of the first quarter in both areas bridge loans as well as conduit loans jessica leviribner and the types of loans you originated this past quarter brian harris you mean property types or are you asking about bridge… jessica leviribner property type brian harris common theme were cautious around certain types of retail i think since we opened in  i don’t believe we have funded a regional mall yet i think we did a small sharing loan at one point a while back but we have avoided the regional loan space having said that we do have some aaas that are secured by regional malls but we feel that’s you we want to be in those situations but we are active in office right now we’re not against retail it’s mostly necessity based retail with a food or drug anchor or else neighborhood just male salons pizza places and things like that apartments we’re seeing more in the bridge area because i think that the gsas take more of that in the permanent area but they incubate in the bridge loan portfolio so we’re seeing a fair amount of that somewhere else if you see some of these big retailers that are cutting back and were closing since stores so they are using less retail so i know that we finance recently a recently vacated kmart shopping center  on that shopping center warehouse that was retented rather quickly in our bridge loan portfolio so i wouldn’t say we certainly have some hotels i’ve said in the past we are seeing a little bit of pressure in the hotel space most of the pressure coming from high end hotels where there is a lot of alternatives as in apartments that are vacant because it i think has an impact there and also the limited service hotel business has had a lot of supply come on the market so there is little bit of a press in there but overall i think we have an economy that’s reasonably healthy and i don’t think its as strong as most of the headlines i read on in the newspapers but its fine and its doing okay we are seeing some positive trends in leasing but i don’t really see a lot of pricing power for a landlord to own a lot of space so you’ve got pretty stable incomes i don’t see anything that would cause me to believe that there is going to be big increases in cash flows in most real estate properties with the possible exception apartments jessica leviribner and then just in terms of any securitization that you do during the second quarter could you size that for us brian harris i’d hesitate to size it because i don’t want to get on the other side of securities laws but i think that we had  million effectively in the inventory if you just add the march st plus production in april and we’re adding to that so we have plenty of product i don’t know how we’ll size the next transaction we do but it will be  it wont be a typical  million or  million contribution to a multioriginated portfolio and i think it will have a lot of lateral loans in it for sure jessica leviribner and just one last one on credit if you’re seeing any  what kind of credit trends you are seeing in your portfolio brian harris just i think in general we are seeing the hotel space flatten out some deteriorating credit conditions in certain areas but for the most part i think its more about just slightly lower prices to try to hold occupancy retail typical big box not doing great some of the restaurants aren’t doing particularly well hotels seem to be doing fine for the most part but as i said not increasing in cash flow and apartments some places are overbuilt but some of the student housing some of the newer product i think is doing pretty well especially where there is waiting list for the associated institutions of education but again just no real increase  no dramatic increases in cash flow or noi but certainly not any big downturns either so its one of these bouncing along economies that i would lean slightly positive towards as opposed to slightly negative operator the next question is from jade rahmani with kbw please go ahead jade rahmani can you provide a liquidity update in terms of available investment capacity brian harris ill ask mark for some of the details on it but i will tell you as we indicated in the call we opened up the year with a fair amount of cash anticipating the possibility anyway of some erratic market conditions because of the new administration and tax planning and who knows what else so were probably a little tax heavy going into the first quarter we thought we were going to try to refinance  million high coupon bond we wound up financing  million transaction so we paid off the  million we raised an additional  million and we have the cash that we started the quarter with so we got a little cash heavy there i think a temporary condition probably of over capitalized and then if you remember in the last call weve been talking about the possibility of doing a shortterm ladder transaction which was floating rate but two to three years and we had about  billion we were looking at we decided to hold on to that transaction and not securitize it because the real effect would have been had we held the first loss position which we would have we would have simply generated a couple of hundred million dollars more in cash which wasn’t necessary at the time we also had a situation for two weeks at the end of march where we had double counting in interest because we have all of the bounds outstanding the  million and s as well as the  million and  we elected to do that before the call date because there were some activities going on with the federal reserve that we didn’t want to pull around with and risk not being able to get finance so we went a little early that probably cost us  million just for the quarter so i guess that’s penny a share in the number but other than that the secondary market sales that took place they were cash neutral to the organization however they did lift our liquidity and our average daily volume so we currently have  the liquidity of the company became more liquid because we sold a lot of securities over two quarter as you know those are highly levered positions so while they generated about  cash so we sold  million worth of securities we would have picked up  million in cash or so so we have a lot of cash so i think were working through that we still have a lot of cash presently but i think that will probably get through that before i would say july i don’t think we’ll have worked our way through the cash until we get through the second quarter it’ll probably be just after that jade rahmani and whats the amount of committed financing available for additional investment marc fox  billion is the statistic and i think that just to elaborate on what brian said i think in terms of our liquidity i think over the course of the quarter we become more flexible with respect to our liquidity adding on the  million of unsecured debt definitely is a more flexible situation than relying on secured debt instead we added on another  million on to our unsecured revolving credit facility that also gave us some additional flexibility as to how we proceed brian harris and if you just take that  million there in three to one multiples you are getting up around  million plus we had cash going into the quarter jade rahmani and what is the unrestricted cash relate to marc fox unrestricted cash is cash… jade rahmani …the restricted cash marc fox the restricted cash is a combination of escrow deposits that we might have deposits from tenants that we might have on properties its what you’d call margin that we have on our derivative positions et cetera jade rahmani what was the aggregate amount of securities you sold in the quarter marc fox we sold  million of securities  million brian harris and how much paid off marc fox and we had  million of amortization on payoffs brian harris so jade over the last two quarters i think we have paid off or sold been paid off on prematurely or sold over billion dollars worth of cmbs marc fox that is correct jade rahmani did you buy any cmbs in the quarter brian harris yes we had buy some marc… marc fox we bought  million in this quarter we bought  million in the preceding quarter jade rahmani can you give an update on the aggregate number of condos that were sold in the quarter and what technical difficulty… marc fox we sold  condominiums during the course of the quarter the gain was  million on a core basis brian harris that was a pretty slow quarter for us i don’t have the breakout but i know that las vegas in particular was very slow in january and february or as in i don’t think we sold any units i don’t have a good answer for why that is we’ve had a meeting with them out there it has to do with traffic i’d say there wasn’t a lot of activity in the quarter and all those things have picked up again jade rahmani and how about the florida property brian harris i believe florida is doing fine its a low price point i don’t know  how many did we sell in florida marc fox we sold six in florida i think the first quarter has historically been pretty a lighter quarter overall brian harris and what did we sell in per unit do you have them marc fox yes  million a square foot so we’re still in that  to  a square foot range brian harris florida i would tell you my own  having spent a little bit of time there in january at the crefc conference it looks a little overcooked to me on the condo side especially along the beaches i would point out that our only exposure is not on the beaches on the north land river and this cost basis the price point is a very low price point and fits a lot of people so we’re very comfortable where we are and we expect to continue selling those las vegas we’re almost sold out i don’t know what the numbers we have left i don’t know if you have it marc marc fox las vegas we have  units brian harris so we’re almost done there jade rahmani so six units sold in florida none in vegas so what was the other  marc fox we had  in vegas its just the low level of… brian harris i thought january and february we… marc fox we did better in march jade rahmani and just wanted to ask about this i know you don’t give earnings guidance but it seems like you’ve noted that there are couple of drags on earnings in the quarter namely no securitization activity excess cash double interest and so looking at the consensus earnings expectations the forecast is for sequential improvement in earnings is there anything that you would say to a caution analyst and their estimates brian harris we don’t get too much guidance but as i said we do expect to return to the securitization market in the second quarter that’s not promise we think we will under normal market conditions we also could be picking up some additional sales in real estate i don’t think the condo business will be slower than it was in the first quarter but then we also have some other properties that we’re getting some interest from people that may want to buy them i don’t know if that closed in the second quarter but they could operator the next question is from rick shane with j p morgan please go ahead rick shane most have been asked and answered but just curious i mean look were in a strange environment there is little bit of uncertainty in terms of securitization execution but that does seem to be improving little bit more concern about credit and specific buckets yet were seeing spreads really tight curious how you approach that what your concerns are and when you see conditions like this before where you start seeing technical factors overwhelm fundamental factors brian harris its a mouthful but i tend to agree its relatively flat yield curve so the federal reserve has raised interest rates twice in a short period of time and longterm interest rates have fallen so that’s a clear flattener and with libor at  and the  year treasury or whatever that is  and it’s a very flat curve so when we have a situation like that especially if youre hedging the financial instrument against interest rate movements you really have no carry it’s a very thin carry business which is why i think youre seeing the banks get a looked at by lot of the analysts fiscally it’s how they make money now the banks have an extraordinarily low cost to funds because of deposits and they don’t work off libor but anybody working off of libor is experiencing flat curve and as we said we sold  million something worth of shortterm securities we did manage to make  on our profit margin there so we’re pretty comfortable there but were not acquiring a lot of shortterm securities right now because the levered return even at a low cost to funds is  so we’re just not acquiring those so we have no appetite to add to that portfolio right now we might add on the longer end there are some really strange things going on as i think you pointed out in that mortgage spreads are actually rather wide where corporate spreads are incredibly tight as well as high yield spreads so im little perplexed although i think the wider mortgage spreads have to do with absolute rates and in addition the discussions that’s in the news lately about the fed unwinding their mortgage back securities portfolio so there was a press headline that went by saying somebody said that if the fed unwinds their mbs portfolio spreads wont widen that’s insane that’s absolutely not going to be the case if they decide to unwind that portfolio so i think that is a concern of some people but im of the opinion the fed really never has to unwind that portfolio they can keep it forever so i think that’s a very controllable instrument i don’t think that they are going to do anything to disrupt things but aaa  years and the commercial side is still trading and it was a spread of  over swaps that’s relatively wide especially when high yield index is probably at its low since  low ever maybe we’re fortunate that we were able to  million at  you saw some of our competitors do something similar to that and the aftermarket on some of those positions they are trading incredibly low on yield considering their own secured bonds when i look at a cmbs five year versus an unsecured corporate five year i will take the cmbs five year all day there but that’s not the  i think it has to do with liquidity and also the fed scaring hell out of everybody rick shane so did you just called janet yell on order brian harris no i didn’t operator the next question is from charles nabhan with wells fargo please go ahead charles nabhan most of my questions have been asked but i was hoping to get some color around your expectations for repayments and maturities over the next couple quarters i appreciate the color on the pipeline and the origination pace but just trying to get a better sense of how we should think about the trajectory of the overall portfolio going forward brian harris you mean our payoffs marc fox are you talking about just the refinance pipeline in cmbs world charles nabhan no within the balance sheet within the held for investment portfolio… brian harris marc will answer it marc fox so when you look at our loan portfolio specifically our balance sheet loans because that’s where you’d want to focus over the course of this year we have and this is just initial maturity base  million of loans that are scheduled to mature that said a number of these loans have the ability to be extended and so they probably wont be paid off and that’s something you just determinate you go on throughout the year and these maturities of spreads spread throughout the year fairly evenly with a little bit of concentration towards the end of the year brian harris and charles we keep our portfolio rather on target with a relatively short maturity date for the most part and i don’t have the numbers to support it but i expect  to  of our portfolio to pay off every quarter its in general its a two year portfolio and its a fairly uniform string of maturity dates coming up we’ve added one type of asset that we’ve been having a lot of success with because as the expectations of libor going up are filtering through the system most of the typical floating rate loan quotes that are being floated to borrowers include cap rates you have to buy cap because people are concerned lender are concerned about libor going higher we are comfortable because of our diverse financing sources we’re actually writing some fixed rate loans with three year maturities and where obviously no cap is required where we will handle the hedging portion of that and we’re not overly concerned about libor getting away from us and we know how to hedge it so for the borrower who has a relatively tight cash flow with a short window where he has to execute his business plan rather than go out and buy cap rates with minimum interest we are offering products where we will wave our prepayment penalties and also do a fixed rate loan for two or three or four years and that’s been pretty popular charles nabhan and i guess since you mentioned it could you provide some color on maturity expectation repayment expectations for the cmb as portfolio as well brian harris that’s a little trickier because i think what risk retention has done you’ve got what ill refer to as the banks the large banks that are in the space they seem to be deliberately targeting loans below at  ltv that puts them squarely in line with the competition with insurance companies and i mean reason for that is that under risk retention the bps buyers and as well as the investment grade buyers there is lot of sticky credit around right now where investors are demanding premiums for things that appear to be highly levered highly levered these days is often times talked about as over  i guess a lot has been learned in  years but from my prospective i think that there is a world of business that can be done between  and  and that’s really the opportunity that i see because for the most part some of the shadow banks if you will or the reits that are making these loans if they are looking to securitize them they won’t hold the position what they will do is they will get a bank or somebody to finance a vertical strip and they will sell the first loss piece to a bp buyer at ladder we feel very comfortable that we can originate loans with ltvs above  especially as we understand the real estate and since we’re very comfortable also owning that first loss piece we’re not really paying attention to where the large banks and the insurance companies are lending and we are seeing some very attractive situations lending opportunities in the  to  ltv range but when you talk about the cmbs portfolios at large i think there is a hell of a lot of maturities coming up if that’s well documented as the wall of maturities i still think if you haven’t refinance those yet given where we’ve been on interest rate i don’t think youre going to take a  ltv because you would have done that already so i think r there is going to be some structures some structured workouts with mezzanine position and possibly some i would call it a partial foreclosure where you give a kicker to a lender who lends you a lot of money but i think that that’s going to be a slow process i don’t think its moving as quick as people would think however i do think that sometimes these borrowers little bit overlevered given where we are today and the amount of capital chasing yield i do think they can sell the properties so that may suppress some of the cmbs activity that we might which was coming but there seems to be plenty to do operator the next question is from jade rahmani with kbw he has a supplemental question please go ahead jade rahmani can you comment on that elevated stock comps in the quarter wondering if you’ve at all changed the way employees are compensated originated or compensated as a result of the lower securitization volume marc fox no we haven’t the elevated stock comp number is simply a result of the vesting process taking its course that was defined in the plans that were set up a couple of years ago i think when you look at the q you will be able to see the disclosures that are pretty clear brian harris our originators and employees are paved its a performance based compensation scheme as far as cash goes so our accrual rate for cash accrual was lower this quarter than it was in the first quarter of last year but we expect to catch up on that jade rahmani and just secondly the triple net lease portfolio i think the latest supplemental since the last quarter shows about  exposes the retail and i do see the properties listed for sale on the web site some of the retail exposure but just overall can you comment on the triple net lease portfolio there was a prominent reset had a extremely messy quarter last week and noted an uptake in retail bankruptcies impacting the portfolio so wanted to get some color there brian harris i think that you have to be a little bit careful as i was reading a little bit about that situation and sometimes when we had applied a few long term flat leases some people were saying well i would rather have a short term lease that can raise the rent and when the rent rolls and i think what was formally an opportunity is now starting to look like a problem in bricksandmortar we have always taken an approach towards real estate with  per foot concept in mind so we do underwrite first on credit but second on real estate and so if we had a wide spread bankruptcies in one of our tenants we wouldn’t expect to not take a loss but we do think it would be muted some corporate tenants especially tenants that are getting weaker will sometimes hock their estate portfolios at very high rents really in an attempt to assess the mortgage market rather than the corporate bond market so we’re constantly weary of that what you also have to be aware of today is that even healthy retailers are closing down stores companies that may not be anywhere near bankruptcy but you still will have a vacant store so you have to be very careful around that too the situation i think that really got messy there was not so much attributed to triple net properties or retail in generally its actually one tenant that they had and that’s tenant we had seen numerous aaa opportunities from that tenant and we turned them down on credit we did not feel comfortable with those credits we do have some exposure to retail but its all looked at as necessity retail not to say that amazon couldn’t get in the game on some of them but we do have a lot of grocery stores we do have a lot of drug stores we have dollar stores we don’t have family dollar or dollar true we do have some dollar generals and we’re pretty comfortable but the only retailer that we have exposure to i think that i am not particularly comfortable with the way the private equity guys have taken dividends out of bjs wholesale club we have some of those but oddly enough its as reported recently that amazon is looking to buy bj’s perhaps that is not anything i know about so if we don’t hear it the wrong way it was just came across on the press so to me its a warehouse club and a lot of the retail that we own are often times in geographic areas and socioeconomic areas where we don’t think that amazon prime is the natural course of business for a lot of them jade rahmani and is  is there about total amount of retail exposure in the net lease portfolio brian harris marc is pointing me at something here marc fox so  in the real estate portfolio right jade rahmani so the walgreens and those ranks have changed et cetera that is all in that retail category not in another profit type marc fox yes that’s correct jade rahmani thanks very much brian harris hey jade i was just handed an index card that says we do on a couple of family dollar sorry about that operator ladies and gentleman we have reached the end of the question and answer session i would like to turn the call back over to brian harris for closing remarks brian harris just thank everybody for joining us this afternoon or those of you who listen to it later i do appreciate the time and we look forward to talking again next time thanks operator
