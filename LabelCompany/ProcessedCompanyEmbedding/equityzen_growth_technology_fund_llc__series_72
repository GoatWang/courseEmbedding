the great depression economic thought placed greater emphasis onshortrun fluctuationsmodern macroeconomics developed as an attempt to explainshortrun business cyclesthe study of economic growth focuses on the factors that cause aneconomys production possibility curve to shift outsays law allows growth theorists toignore aggregate demand and focus only on aggregate supplythe rule of  implies that a country with a growth rate of  percent will double its income in about yearssuppose botswana doubles its income in  years while south africa doubles its income in  years according to the rule of  the growth rate in botswana is percentage points higher than the growth rate in south africamarkets help to promote growth byincreasing specialization and the division of laborby increasing specialization and the division of labor markets make it possible for a country to focus its production more heavily on its area of comparative advantage this increases efficiency and productivitymakes the average person better off but may worsen the distribution of incomeeconomic growth through the market hashelped both rich and poorif output increases by  percent and population growth is  percent per capita outputgrows by  percentif the distribution of the gains from growth matter growth in median income isa more informative measure of growth than growth in per capita income when the gains from growth are concentrated on a small segment of the populationwhat effect would we expect the market for loanable funds if people increase their savingsupply will shift right and demand will not changein the early s analysts feared that low academic achievement in math in the united states may reduce us economic growth by as much as half a percentage point a year in terms of factors leading to growth the low math scores indicate that the us may be at a disadvantage in terms ofhuman capitalsome economists argue that wellfunctioning capital markets that allow funds to move from those who have but do not need funds to those who need but do not have funds are essential for rapid economic growth wellfunctioning capital markets are an example ofgrowth compatible institutionsover the last three decades the chinese government has adopted a series of marketoriented reforms that have shifted control of many parts of the chinese economy from government officials to private individuals these reforms have most likely stimulated chinas growth for which of the following reasonsthey have provided individuals with a greater incentive to be efficientthe indian government is known for creating obstacles to foreign investment with tariffs investment caps and tons of red tape what effect does red tape have on growthit discourages entrepreneurshipgrowth compatible institutionshave incentives built into them that lead people to put forth effortwhich of the following would tend to inhibit growthgovernment approval of all economic activitymany economists now deemphasize capital accumulation as a source of growth becausecapital accumulation alone does not necessarily lead to growthto an economist a production function isan equation showing how much output can be produced from various combinations of inputsthe law of diminishing marginal productivity implies that opportunity costincreases as one input is increased to produce successive units of outputthe most important policy implication of the classical growth model is thatpolicies to stimulate saving and investment will stimulate economic growthjamaica has far less capital than singapore based on this the classical growth model would predict that as each accumulates more capital jamaica would growmore rapidly than singaporehow do investment in technology and investment in capital differthey have different effects on output because of the positive externalities associated with investments in technologylearning by doing implies thatgreater experience increases efficiencythe law of diminishing marginal productivitymay apply even when learning by doing is present new growth theory emphasizes the importance of all of the following exceptdiminishing marginal productivitynetwork externalitiescan explain why the economy fails to adopt the most efficient technologieskeynesian economists believe government can implement policy proposals that can positively impact the economy laissezfaire economists believemost government policies would probably make things worseclassical economist is often used interchangeably with which termlaissezfaire economistkeynesian economists focus their analysis onthe short runbetween  and  the us unemployment rate rose from under  percent to over  percent a keynesian economist would most likely blame this increase in unemployment ona decline in the level of aggregate demandwhich of the following statements would a classical economist of the s most likely disagree withunions do not impede wage and price adjustmentthe classical economists argued thatif unemployment occurs it will cure itself because wages and prices will fallwhich of the following was not a solution to the depression favored by classical economistshire unemployed workers for public works programsequilibrium income is that level of incometoward which the economy gravitates in the shortrunkeynes believed equilibrium income wasnot fixed at the economys potential incomein  the personal savings rate rose if the additional savings were not translated into investment keynes would predict that aggregate income woulddecline and remain therethe paradox of thrift occurs whenan increase in saving reduces outputkeynes argued thatthe shortrun is a more important policy concern than the longrunthe shapes of the curves in the asad model are basedon the relationship between the price level and total outputhow is the asad model related to the supply and demand model of microeconomicsit looks similar to the supply and demand model but is not based on itas prices fall people become richer and buy more this occurs as a result ofthe money wealth effectan increase in the price leveldecreases the purchasing power of money leading to higher interest rates and decreases investmentif the price level rises the interest rate effect will cause investmentand the quantity of aggregate demand to decreasea rise in the us price level will causeexports to decrease and imports to increasein the asad model the repercussions that a change in quantity demanded has on production and subsequently on income and expenditures is called themultiplier effectthe multiplier effect exists becauseproduction and expenditures are interdependentwhen aggregate demand is declining and the price level needs to fall to bring about equilibrium pressure for the price level to fall brings expectations of falling aggregate demand lower asset prices and financial panics triggered by the decline in the value of financial assets if these forces are strong enough these dynamic effects can create aleftward shift in the aggregate demand curvea decrease in the expected future income of the us would likelyshift its ad curve to the leftwhich of the following would shift the aggregate demand curve to the rightan increase in foreign incomea change in the distribution of income affects the ad curve becauseworkers are more likely than stockholders to spend the income they receiveif the multiplier effect is  a  billion increase in government expenditures will shift the ad curveto the right by  billionif productivity increases by  but wages increase by  then it is most likely that the price level willfall by  percentif actual output exceeds potential output the economyis experiencing an inflationary gapfiscal policies are policies that directly affectgovernment spending and taxesa policy that raises taxes or reduces government spending is calleda contractionary fiscal policycontractionary fiscal policies are most appropriate when the economy is inan inflationary gapoutput is beneath potential output soexpansionary fiscal policy like a tax cut is most appropriatean expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate whenan economy is experiencing a recessionary gapa contractionary fiscal policy is most appropriate whenan economy is experiencing an inflationary gapwhen output equals potential output an economy is in longrun equilibriumso no change in fiscal policy is desirablethe multiplier modelprovides numerical estimates of how equilibrium output changes in response to changes in aggregate expendituresthe multiplier model is designed to answer which one of the following questionshow will output be affected by changes in aggregate expendituresgraphically the aggregate production curve is a straight line that goes through the origin and has a slope of at all points on the aggregate production curveincome equals productionautonomous expenditures are defined as expenditures thatoccur regardless of the level of incomeinduced expenditures are defined as expenditures thatchange as income changesautonomous expenditures are expenditures that occur whenincome is zerothe marginal propensity to expend equals the ratio ofthe change in aggregate expenditure to a change in incomeas the mpe rises the slope of the expenditures curveincreasesthe marginal propensity to expenddepends on the marginal

expendituresan increase in the marginal propensity to expendraises output by raising induced expendituresthe multiplier effect would not occur ifthe marginal propensity to expend equaled during the first year of the reagan administration taxes were cut significantly at that time potential gdp was  trillion while actual gdp was  trillion given this the tax cut most likelydecreased a recessionary gapassume the mpe   gdp   billion and potential gdp   billion according to the multiplier model the economy could achieve potential gdp if government spending weredecreased by  billionif the marginal

qa december   view as pdf fund managers charlie chai qa an interview with portfolio manager charlie chai charlie how did the fund perform for the year ending december   the funds share classes gained roughly  trailing the  return of the msci us imi information technology  index and falling just behind the  return of the broader sp ® however the fund outpaced its peer group average considerable market volatility and investors preference for defensive stocks and sectors weighed on the funds relative results in the first six months of the year penalizing my emphasis on growthoriented stocks in seculargrowth industries and secondarily on cyclically sensitive stocks with improving fundamentals in the second half of the year investors grew less defensive and focused more on company fundamentals this riskon attitude helped a number of the funds holdings particularly in the semiconductor space where stock choices and an overweighting jointly made that industry easily our largest contributor positioning in systems software also added value specifically where did the fund run into problems versus the msci sector index stock selection and an overweighting in internet software  services weighed on relative results along with nonbenchmark exposure to internet  direct marketing the first group was home to the funds largest detractor chinabased online advertising provider com this outofbenchmark stock was hurt by selling pressure related to the companys purchase of privately held rival ganjicom as well as the challenges of integrating ganji and other recent acquisitions additionally com issued disappointing revenue guidance in november recently imposed regulations by local chinese governments intended to curb real estate speculation – including higher downpayment requirements – played a part in the firm lowering expectations for propertyrelated advertising on its platform i continued to believe in the longerterm prospects for this stock as i saw it as a potential beneficiary of the growth of chinas middle class one of the broader themes i keep my eye on for riskmanagement purposes i reduced this position somewhat but retained most of it at period end also detracting was an overweighting in electric automaker tesla motors among the funds top holdings at period end after hitting a high for the year in early april the stock consolidated somewhat below that level for the remainder of the period investors remained cautious amid the companys recurring production problems and its decision to purchase solar panel maker solarcity with that said tesla increased production by an impressive  to nearly  vehicles for all of  and i believe the firms rapidly increasing market share could alleviate many of its growing pains finally ill mention untimely ownership of an outofbenchmark position in dena a japanbased provider of online gaming and ecommerce services although the stock rose for the year overall i increased our position here in december shortly before the share price dropped on allegations of inaccurate plagiarized articles on welq its website for health care information i continued to like dena because of the companys joint venture with nintendo to support the latters development of a mobile game platform the first entry for this platform was the highly anticipated super mario run released in middecember other games are already in the pipeline overall the funds holdings of foreign stocks were a drawback this period amid the us dollars strong appreciation in the fourth quarter of  what about contributors a large overweighting in semiconductor maker marvell technology group was the funds largest relative contributor with our position rising  this period the company attracted activist investors and went through a major restructuring process with new management i considerably reduced this position as the stock advanced taking profits along the way overweighting micron technology – a maker of dram nand flash and other kinds of digital memory – also stood out for its positive impact on our relative results i increased this position as the shares fell to a midsingledigit priceearnings pe ratio early in  – well below the broader markets pe ratio based on my expectations for microns earnings in  i thought this was far too pessimistic this turned out to be a good call as the stock enjoyed a sustained rally from midmay through the end of december i reduced this position too given the robust gains it delivered a nonbenchmark stake in japanbased sumco a producer of silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturers proved timely as well after a cyclical downturn for wafer demand and pricing depressed the stock in the first half of  the supplydemand balance began to normalize in the second half of the year leading to expectations of better pricing for wafer companies i established a stake here in august these developments helped our position post a  return for the period what is your outlook as of period endwhile i expect global technology spending to remain muted in the near term i am optimistic about longerterm trends for the major themes ive identified such as cloud computing software as a service saas big data artificial intelligence and the internet of things over the past decade services internet and software companies have been steadily taking market share from hardware firms the cloud and saas are better value propositions for customers the advantages include smoothing capital expenditures rationalizing hardware costs eliminating the need to manage it infrastructure and keeping clients on the cutting edge of technology more recently we have witnessed the significant development of artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications such as image and voice recognition this development has been driven by the vast amount of data collected in many internetbased applications the material improvement in machinelearning algorithms and the significant reduction in unit computing costs i believe we are in the early to middle innings of this and many other paradigm shifts in the tech sector similar to the mainframe and clientserver eras i believe big shifts in profit pools and market capitalization are possible and my goal is to monitor these changes closely and position the fund to take advantage of them ■ charlie chai on opportunities in international tech companies consistent with my longstanding strategy i continue to look for new ideas in the international markets where many companies are undiscovered or underfollowed by research analysts i believe these markets are a source of compelling growth opportunities for example in the consumer segment internet services and ecommerce companies remain attractive growers especially those that sit at the intersection of the social mobile and local themes in asian markets – especially china south korea and japan – these industries have generally seen a pace of innovation as fast as if not faster than their western peers this pace has been driven by a less intrusive regulatory environment and incumbent companies in certain industries that are much less mature internet finance is another area of rapid growth consumer credit offerings have very low penetration in markets such as china and in southeast asia smartphone adoption has started to resemble growth trends seen in china three years ago i believe considerable longterm value will be created in this region after a period of significant capital inflows weve seen a recent decline in corporate fundraising activity which i believe is very positive for existing internet companies because it means higher barriers to entry and less competition key takeaways the funds share classes gained roughly  for the year ending december   lagging the  return of the msci us imi information technology  index growthoriented stocks in seculargrowth industries favored by portfolio manager charlie chai struggled early in the year amid considerable market volatility and investors preference for defensive stocks and sectors versus the msci sector index stock selection and an overweighting in internet software  services weighed on results along with nonbenchmark exposure to internet  direct marketing conversely stock choices and an overweighting in semiconductors contributed most while positioning in systems software also added value although charlie expects global technology spending to remain muted in the near term hes optimistic about longerterm prospects for the major themes hes identified market recap the sp ® index returned  in  rising sharply on postelection optimism for economic growth the year began during a fairly volatile stretch with stocks hampered by persistent oilprice weakness and usdollar strength markets regained momentum in february amid us job gains a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly sevenyear uptrend intact markets tumbled briefly following the uks june  vote to exit the european union – dubbed brexit – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the november  us presidential election stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of alltime highs for the year energy  led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices one in the spring and another in november telecommunication services  was close behind as demand for dividendpaying equities was high early in the period cyclical sectors including financials  industrials  and materials  also posted strong gains conversely consumer staples  and consumer discretionary  lagged the index the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brickandmortar retailers real estate  struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates while health care  was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook performance summary variable annuity contracts are issued by insurance companies through separate accounts that are part of the

 stars morningstar has awarded this fund  stars based on its riskadjusted performance compared to the  funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high below average this funds expenses are rated as below average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds

funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high above average this fund scores above average because it delivered returns that were in the top  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category top   high next   above average middle   average next   below average bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to
