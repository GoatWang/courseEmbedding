takes  days to finalize some files it took a week in fact i had to email and asked why they took so long its been a month and i still do not have my business card printed  they said theyre not responsible for defects like small points or small lines in the final printed products theyre not responsible if the product color does not look the same this is ridiculous since they are the one who designs and prints their own products but they are not responsible for their finished outcome  hidden fees are everywhere i purchased the top package which in included business card printed and as things were progressing there were fees that they did not tell me up front it was too late for me withdraw since i already paid almost  i had to pay extra  to have the back side of the card done differently because what they offered in my original package was totally plain then i waited another  days to hear from them then paid  for shipping which takes  days to ship on top of  printing days

understand how to use english properly to convey their messages so i am stuck trying to interpret what they mean and trying to decipher emails is a joke if you ask a question in an email good luck getting an answer youll probably just get another question as a response and the question will have nothing to do with your original questionmost women end every sentence with an inflection so it sounds like they are asking a question when they arent no fault of their own though if you are a woman at deluxe and you are perceived to be rude then you are a horrible person in everyones eyes you must maintain the appearance and perception of being super nice and motherly speaking of motherly if you dont have kids expect to treated differently your time no longer matters you have zero responsibilities outside of work since you dont have kids so expect to work longer hours because of your life choices men dont have it easy either they have to be nice but still firm and into sportspeople will try to sell you things at work many people there cannot afford to live on the measly pay they get and have been sucked into pyramid schemes in order to make ends meet you feel guilty not buying stuff from your coworkers but you can barely afford your own renthr is completely incompetent and doesnt give a crap about you you tell them something important or time sensitive and they act like you just said whats up and they do not understand their job is very private dont leave employees personal files out when youre meeting with a different employeedo you like food if so bring your own their idea of a cafeteria is gas station food no real food anymore prepackaged food like items to consume at extremely high prices who would pay  for packaged soup i can get soup cheaper at walmartand if you dont like being micromanaged dont work here your boss will be on you all the time i get they have metrics to meet but if im sick and cant afford to take a sick day because i dont want to use pto dont get mad because i had to use the restroom more often that day yes i know my adherence was off but i dont care i cared more about not vomiting in front of my coworkers or on the phone with a customer next time i will not be so courteousand if you want a place to advance your career look somewhere else they act like you can advance quickly even the trainers say they advanced quickly but they must be a fluke most people make lateral moves not getting much if any of a raise and they now have these extra jobs you can do which will provide more ojt for more experience like onboarding mentor really you dont pay more but expect me to do morealso a very unethical company will punish people for being out sick even though youre not supposed to do that will fire people for not showing up for work because they were in the hospitaladvice to managementstop paying the ceo millions of dollars each year stop paying the higher ups vp and such so much money maybe you could use that extra money to actually improve the moral of your employees there is no fun at work anymore i used to enjoy coming into work and after a couple years i just felt like i was slavealso fire everyone who is vp level and up and get new blood in the door people who are either younger know how profitable businesses work or both there are too many people who are stuck in the s way of running
