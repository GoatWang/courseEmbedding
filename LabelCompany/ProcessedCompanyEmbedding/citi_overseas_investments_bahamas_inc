financial accounts but in the meantime you could put these assets to work—by borrowing against their value for say home renovations college costs tax bills or business startup costs right for you if you want a lower interest rate than nonsecured loan rates you need cash for expenses such as college fees taxes or home upgrades you dont want to sell securities to freeup cash still have questions call us at  tty  to be sure its risky to borrow against the value of your securities because the money borrowed accentuates your losses if your investments fall in value still this strategy has three potential advantages first you can leave your portfolio in place so that it can potentially continue to grow second you can avoid selling securities which could trigger capitalgains tax bills finally because the loan is backed by your portfolios value the interest charged will be lower than for an unsecured loan working with your financial advisor you may be able to pledge marketable securities including stocks corporate bonds government bonds mutual funds and other financial instruments for a loan line of credit or other borrowing you may even be able to borrow against control and restricted stock as well as other nonmargin eligible securities portfolio line of credit this our quickest and easiest way to borrow against the value of your portfolio for just about any personal or business use other than to purchase additional securities not sure that a securitiesbacked loan is right for you talk to your financial advisor about the pros and cons as an alternative you could also explore a homeequity loan or line of credit but these may take longer to set up than a loan tied to your portfolios value however all three types of loans have risks and fees so be sure to consult your advisor before taking out any type of loan to understand all the terms and conditions call us at  tty  to open an account or learn more investment and insurance products not insured by the fdic •

security availability qualifications and other restrictions may vary by state ask your financial advisor for details a home equity line of credit is a form of revolving credit in which your home serves as collateral home equity plans typically involve variable interest rates rather than fixed rates before entering into a plan consider how you will pay back any money you might borrow some plans set minimum payments that cover a portion of the principal the amount you borrow plus accrued interest but unlike the typical installment loan the portion that goes toward principal may not be enough to repay the debt by the end of the term costs to obtain a home equity line many of the costs in setting up a home equity line are similar to those you pay when buying a home for example a fee for a property appraisal which estimates the value of your home an application fee which may not be refundable if you are turned down for credit upfront charges such as one or more points one point equals one percent of the credit limit other closing costs which include fees for attorneys title search mortgage preparation and filing property and title insurance as well as taxes certain fees during the plan for example some plans impose yearly membership or maintenance fees you also may be charged a transaction fee every time you draw on the credit line diversification does not protect
