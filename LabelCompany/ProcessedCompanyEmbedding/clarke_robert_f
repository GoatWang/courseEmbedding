wright a  yearold yale law school graduate working with the naacps legal defense fund in mississippi she told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the mississippi delta in addition to this twoparent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits and most counties in mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps with little to no income most households could not produce the necessary funds as a result wright argued mississippians were starving theyre starving and those who can get the bus fare to go north are trying to go north i wish that the senators would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the delta and the number of people who are going around and begging just to feed their children chairman joseph s clark suggested that the subcommittee travel to mississippi to verify wrights testimony of the subcommittees nine members senators robert f kennedy jacob javits george murphy agreed to the idea and accompanied him kennedy dispatched his aide peter edelman to get an advanced view on the situation edelman spoke extensively with wright whom he would marry  months later trip to the deltaedit the subcommittee members flew into jackson on april  that evening the senators dined with prominent mississippians including oscar carr and charles evers carr later described kennedy as a very shy man who continuously asked questions evers said we talked and talked and he listened local civil rights activist amzie moore acted as kennedys host a field hearing took place the next day testimony was given about conditions in the delta from both public officials and local impoverished inhabitants kennedy took greater interest in the latters statements afterwards he told evers i want to see it kennedys and clarks touredit a rundown house in the mississippi delta c  the following day kennedy and clark drove into the delta area while the other senators flew back to washington dc they were accompanied by evers wright moore edelman carr a dozen or so reporters from state and national newspapers and the big three television networks and an assortment of us marshals state highway patrolmen and local police that morning the senators reviewed antipoverty programs underway in greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers after lunch kennedys and clarks motorcade traveled at speeds over  mph down us route  to visit locations specifically selected by wright and moore their first stop was a dilapidated shotgun house in cleveland in which  people resided holes were present in the flooring and roofing and the only food in the refrigerator was a jar of peanut butter one boy told kennedy that all he had for breakfast and dinner was molasses and that he didnt eat any lunch walking to the next house kennedy whispered to edelman ive been to thirdworld countries and ive never seen anything like this the following home belonged to a mother of seven there were no tables or cutlery in the house and the toilet operated without plumbing roaches and rats ran across the floor kennedys attention was drawn to a  monthold boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor the child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger kennedy knelt down and stroked his cheek he said my god i didnt know this kind of thing existed how can a country like this allow it maybe they just dont know clark labeled what lay before them a national disgrace kennedy caressed the child and talked to him but elicited no response the senator began to cry kennedy stepped outside and quietly remarked we spend  billion a year on armaments and  billion a year on dogs we have to do more for these children that didnt ask to be born into this local newspaper editor cliff langford who strongly disliked kennedy shouted back that the two senators were being brainwashed clark retorted dont worry weve been brainwashed from the other side langford added i dont know of anybody starving down here kennedy responded step over here and ill introduce you to some clark reassured the reporters that he and kennedy were not observing conditions in the delta to find fault but rather just to see if we can do anything about it the senators motorcade continued on towards clarkesdale but kennedy asked that they stop in the small town of mound bayou with no advanced notice kennedy his aides and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a  yearold man named andrew jackson his wife and their six kids there was no electricity running water or toilet there were two pictures in the house one of the glorybound singers a clarksdalebased gospel group and another of john f kennedy jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked is you really mr bobby kennedy kennedy smiled and shook his hand replying yes and are you really mr andrew jackson a thousand people mostly black school children awaited the senators outside the clarksdale neighborhood center clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled as their flight in memphis was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was going to catch that plane meanwhile kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd he said he was glad to have made the trip and told them the problems of poverty are problems of all united states citizens he was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued onto the highway the senators had only been in the city for  minutes aftermathedit government responseedit that night kennedy returned to washington dc he walked in on his family having dinner at hickory hill highly agitated and in the words of his daughter kathleen ashen faced he announced to his children in mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room the children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food do you know how lucky you are do you know how lucky you are do something for your country the following morning kennedy and edelman met with secretary of agriculture orville freeman and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families that had no income freeman deflected bob there isnt anyone in america who has no income kennedy replied ill tell you what ill send peter edelman here back down there with some of your people will you agree that youll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in mississippi who have no income freeman agreed and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps returning to new york the next day kennedy exclaimed to the wife of one of his aides you dont know what i saw i have done nothing in my life everything i have done was a waste everything i have done was worthless when asked about the poverty subcommittees findings clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to the war on poverty he also said that the united states needed a reawakening of a conscience the entire subcommittee sent a letter to president lyndon b johnson about their discoveries writing about conditions of malnutrition and widespread hungerthat can only be described as shocking several johnson administration officials in addition to freeman were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the delta johnson had seen the news coverage of the event and on april  he ordered that his top domestic aide joseph califano give him a quick report califano replied  minutes later writing that freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administrations food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by congress when his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan johnson already uneasy about the food stamp program rejected the proposal kennedy made a direct appeal to johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for – of the most impoverished mississippians johnson ignored it a decision an editorial in the nation claimed was due to the fact that he was incapable of rising above personal politics once news of the situation in the delta went public mississippi governor paul b johnson jr dismissed the report as the product of “socialistminded senators” he also told journalist bill minor “all the negroes i’ve seen around here are so fat they shine” following the publication in june of a particularly severe report complied by the field foundation of new york governor johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about childrens nutrition its findings concurred with those of the field foundation in july clark held another set of congressional hearings on the issue attracting widespread media coverage the hearings were tense with clark kennedy javits and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with mississippi senators john stennis and james eastland both staunch segregationists and mississippi board of health officer a l gray kennedy called child psychologist robert coles to testify on povertys effect on children in the mississippi delta one north carolina doctor described an unwritten policy on the part of those who control the state to eliminate the negro mississippian either by driving him out of the state or starving him to death when stennis and eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves to which none accepted on the second day of proceedings secretary freeman and senator javits got into a shouting match with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities opinions declare an emergency and immediately supply food to the region he remarked we seem to be able to send airplanes to the congo in a terrible hurry we first heard of the desperation point of poor mississippi negroes  months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in mississippi kennedy openly expressed his frustration with johnson administration officials perceived inability to understand the extent of the deltas problems and other bureaucratic complications saying it seems to me we are floundering around a great deal in the end kennedy managed to amend the renewal of the economic opportunity act of  to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a  million emergency fund be established for food and medical services despite resistance from other southern legislators and a lack of support from president johnson stennis bill passed the senate also voted unanimously to create a select committee on nutrition and human needs the poverty subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work public reactionedit demonstrators of the poor peoples march on washington the media coverage from the event brought national attention to the food insecurity issues in the delta most americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area almost immediately the field foundation of new york dispatched a team of doctors to mississippi to examine children and verify the senators findings they labeled the conditions they observed a national disaster documenting cases of kwashiorkor rickets and other signs of malnutrition and starvation one doctor likened state of affairs to the worst he had seen in eastern kenya this countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation the citizens crusade against poverty an advocacy group already studying the problems in the delta quickly created a citizens board of inquiry into hunger and malnutrition in the united states in april  the board published a report of its findings entitled hunger usa this was shortly followed by a critique of the national school lunch program by a coalition of womens organizations in conversation with wright and edelemen kennedy remarked the only way theres going to be change is if its more uncomfortable for congress not to act than it is for them to actyouve got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to washington and stay here untilcongress gets really embarrassed and they have to act the following week wright proposed the idea to martin luther king jr who subsequently organized the poor peoples march on washington around the same time cbs broadcast a major documentary hunger in america which had been made on the suggestion of kennedy to television executive don hewitt legacyedit the trip to the mississippi delta made hunger a public issue in the united states following the revelations of food insecurity a powerful antihunger movement emerged in the country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones federal expenditures on food assistance grew by  percent over the next decade marian wright would later say that the episode set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in the virtual elimination of hunger in

senators motorcade continued on towards clarkesdale but kennedy asked that they stop in the small town of mound bayou with no advanced notice kennedy his aides and half a dozen reporters walked into the home of a  yearold man named andrew jackson his wife and their six kids there was no electricity running water or toilet there were two pictures in the house one of the glorybound singers a clarksdalebased gospel group and another of john f kennedy jackson was incredulous that he was meeting the brother of the late president and asked is you really mr bobby kennedy kennedy smiled and shook his hand replying yes and are you really mr andrew jackson a thousand people mostly black school children awaited the senators outside the clarksdale neighborhood center clark climbed on top of a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled as their flight in memphis was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was going to catch that plane meanwhile kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd he said he was glad to have made the trip and told them the problems of poverty are problems of all united states citizens he was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued onto the highway the senators had only been in the city for  minutes aftermathedit government responseedit that night kennedy returned to washington dc he walked in on his family having dinner at hickory hill highly agitated and in the words of his daughter kathleen ashen faced he announced to his children in mississippi a whole family lives in a shack the size of this room the children are covered with sores and their tummies stick out because they have no food do you know how lucky you are do you know how lucky you are do something for your country the following morning kennedy and edelman met with secretary of agriculture orville freeman and angrily criticized the food stamp program for charging families that had no income freeman deflected bob there isnt anyone in america who has no income kennedy replied ill tell you what ill send peter edelman here back down there with some of your people will you agree that youll change the regulations if your people are convinced there really are people in mississippi who have no income freeman agreed and was eventually persuaded by incoming evidence to open up access to food stamps returning to new york the next day kennedy exclaimed to the wife of one of his aides you dont know what i saw i have done nothing in my life everything i have done was a waste everything i have done was worthless when asked about the poverty subcommittees findings clark said that more resources needed to be allocated to the war on poverty he also said that the united states needed a reawakening of a conscience the entire subcommittee sent a letter to president lyndon b johnson about their discoveries writing about conditions of malnutrition and widespread hungerthat can only be described as shocking several johnson administration officials in addition to freeman were skeptical of the reports of starvation in the delta johnson had seen the news coverage of the event and on april  he ordered that his top domestic aide joseph califano give him a quick report califano replied  minutes later writing that freeman was hesitant to make major changes to the administrations food stamp program until the original system was sanctioned by congress when his aides unanimously approved of an extensive relief plan johnson already uneasy about the food stamp program rejected the proposal kennedy made a direct appeal to johnson involving increased subsidization of food stamps and the supplement of emergency food rations for – of the most impoverished mississippians johnson ignored it a decision an editorial in the nation claimed was due to the fact that he was incapable of rising above personal politics once news of the situation in the delta went public mississippi governor paul b johnson jr dismissed the report as the product of “socialistminded senators” he also told journalist bill minor “all the negroes i’ve seen around here are so fat they shine” following the publication in june of a particularly severe report complied by the field foundation of new york governor johnson quietly commissioned a statewide study about childrens nutrition its findings concurred with those of the field foundation in july clark held another set of congressional hearings on the issue attracting widespread media coverage the hearings were tense with clark kennedy javits and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with mississippi senators john stennis and james eastland both staunch segregationists and mississippi board of health officer a l gray kennedy called child psychologist robert coles to testify on povertys effect on children in the mississippi delta one north carolina doctor described an unwritten policy on the part of those who control the state to eliminate the negro mississippian either by driving him out of the state or starving him to death when stennis and eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves to which none accepted on the second day of proceedings secretary freeman and senator javits got into a shouting match with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities opinions declare an emergency and immediately supply food to the region he remarked we seem to be able to send airplanes to the congo in a terrible hurry we first heard of the desperation point of poor mississippi negroes  months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in mississippi kennedy openly expressed his frustration with johnson administration officials perceived inability to understand the extent of the deltas problems and other bureaucratic complications saying it seems to me we are floundering around a great deal in the end kennedy managed to amend the renewal of the economic opportunity act of  to include provisions for a national survey on nutrition stennis was so embarrassed by the hearings that he proposed a  million emergency fund be established for food and medical services despite resistance from other southern legislators and a lack of support from president johnson stennis bill passed the senate also voted unanimously to create a select committee on nutrition and human needs the poverty subcommittee held further field hearings across the country as part of its work public reactionedit demonstrators of the poor peoples march on washington the media coverage from the event brought national attention to the food insecurity issues in the delta most americans were shocked by the conditions described in the area almost immediately the field foundation of new york dispatched a team of doctors to mississippi to examine children and verify the senators findings they labeled the conditions they observed a national disaster documenting cases of kwashiorkor rickets and other signs of malnutrition and starvation one doctor likened state of affairs to the worst he had seen in eastern kenya this countered initial public reactions of disbelief at the severity of the situation the citizens crusade against poverty an advocacy group already studying the problems in the delta quickly created a citizens board of inquiry into hunger and malnutrition in the united states in april  the board published a report of its findings entitled hunger usa this was shortly followed by a critique of the national school lunch program by a coalition of womens organizations in conversation with wright and edelemen kennedy remarked the only way theres going to be change is if its more uncomfortable for congress not to act than it is for them to actyouve got to get a whole lot of poor people who just come to washington and stay here untilcongress gets really embarrassed and they have to act the following week wright proposed the idea to martin luther king jr who subsequently organized the poor peoples march on washington around the same time cbs broadcast a major documentary hunger in america which had been made on the suggestion of kennedy to television executive don hewitt legacyedit the trip to the mississippi delta made hunger a public issue in the united states following the revelations of food insecurity a powerful antihunger movement emerged in the country and worked to reform food assistance programs while proposing new ones federal expenditures on food assistance grew by  percent over the next decade marian wright would later say that the episode set in motion a chain of events that culminated in years later in the virtual elimination of hunger in america during the nixon years see alsoedit great society war on poverty
