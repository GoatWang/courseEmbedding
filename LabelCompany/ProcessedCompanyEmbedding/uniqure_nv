hemophilia b is an inherited disease in males characterized by insufficient blood clotting amt consists of the adenoassociated virus aav vector carrying a human factor ix fix gene cassette that the company has exclusively licensed from st jude children’s research hospital in memphis tennessee the company produces this vector with its insect cellbased manufacturing process it has an ongoing phase iii clinical trialsamt for huntingtons diseaseamt is developed for the treatment of huntingtons disease hd hd is caused by an inherited defect in a single gene that codes for protein called huntingtin the company’s product candidate amt consists of an aav vector carrying an artificial microrna which silences the huntingtin gene the therapeutic goal is to inhibit the production of the mutant proteinsa for congestive heart faliurethe company has entered into an agreement with bms that provides exclusive access to the company’s gene therapy technology platform for multiple targets in cardiovascular and other diseases collaboration and license agreement the collaboration includes its proprietary gene therapy program for congestive heart failure which aims to restore the hearts

formed in the intestine after a fatcontaining meal the product consists of an engineered copy of the human lpl gene packaged with a tissuespecific promoter in a nonreplicating aav vector which has a particular affinity for muscle cells in order to improve activity the company uses a naturally occurring variant of the lpl gene that has higher enzyme activity than the normal version of the gene that encodes the protein it produces glybera using its insect cellbased manufacturing process in the european union the company has been granted orphan drug exclusivity for glybera for treatment of lpld until october  the first commercial patient in europe was treated with glybera in september other earlystage researchthe company is also engaged in the research of several other gene therapy

doseranging phase iii trial of amt its proprietary investigational gene therapy in patients with severe hemophilia b the data includes up to  months of followup from the lowdose cohort and up to one year of followup from the second dose cohort the aavbased amt remains safe and welltolerated with up to a year and a half of followup with no serious adverse events and no development of inhibitors all patients are now past one year of follow up with no loss of factor ix fix activity and no capsidspecific tcell activation oneyear followup data from the seconddose cohort continue to show a dose response with substantial improvement in disease state in all five patients including the discontinuation of routine prophylactic fix infusions in all patients that previously required chronic replacement therapy the annualized spontaneous bleeding rate for the second dose cohort declined  to a mean of  annual bleeds after gene transfer during more than  cumulative patient days of observation only one patient in the second cohort reported two unconfirmed spontaneous bleeds and no such bleeds were reported by any patient during the last six months of observation these clinical data will be presented in an oral presentation at the th biennial congress of the international society on thrombosis and haemostasis isth taking place this week in berlin germany the amt gene therapy consists of a codonoptimized wild type fix gene cassette the lp liver promoter and an aav viral vector manufactured by uniqure using its proprietary insect cellbased technology platform it is the only hemophilia gene therapy that combines a gene cassette with clinically proven multiyear durability now out more than five years and an aav vector serotype that has demonstrated superior safety and broad applicability due to the low prevalence of clinicallyrelevant titers of neutralizing antibodies nabs as evaluated in more than  patients across clinical studies in three different diseases the phase iii openlabel multicenter study includes  patients each receiving a onetime minute intravenous administration of amt without the prophylactic use of corticosteroids the study includes two dose cohorts of five patients each with the first cohort receiving x gckg and the second cohort receiving x gckg nine patients in the trial were classified as having severe  fix activity hemophilia one patient in the lowdose cohort had a moderatesevere  fix activity phenotype patients in the lowdose cohort were characterized by poorly controlled bleeding manifestations despite use of highdose fix replacement therapy during the year prior to study compared to the seconddose cohort all but one patient in the study across both cohorts required chronic infusions of prophylactic fix therapy at the time of enrollment the remaining patient who is in the second dose cohort used fix therapy on demand data as of may   all  patients in the study have demonstrated improvements in their disease state as measured by reduced fix replacement therapy and bleeding frequency in the seconddose cohort no spontaneous bleeds were reported in the last six months of followup with a reduction in the annualized spontaneous bleed rate of  compared to the oneyear period prior to administration of amt total bleeds were reduced by  as previously announced eight of the nine patients that required chronic fix infusions prior to administration of amt have discontinued prophylaxis after treatment all eight patients remained prophylaxisfree at the last follow up across both dose cohorts cumulative annualized fix consumption decreased by  from  million to  iu through up to  months of followup among the five patients in the seconddose cohort the mean steadystate fix activity persisted at approximately  of normal the mean fix activity at the last followup  weeks was  ranging from  to  amt continues to be welltolerated and there have been no severe adverse events in both dose cohorts fix activity remained consistent and stable through up to  months of followup with no emergence of late immune response or loss of fix activity in any of the patients as previously announced three patients experienced mild asymptomatic elevations of alanine aminotransferase alt soon after administration for these patients alt levels returned to their baseline readings no recurrence of alt elevation has occurred and no loss of fix activity was observed no patients across either cohort have developed inhibitory antibodies against fix or demonstrated sustained aav capsidspecific tcell activation
