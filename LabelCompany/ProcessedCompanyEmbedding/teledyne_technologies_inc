litton industries formed a firm named instrument systems located in beverly hills california arthur rock one of americas first and most successful venture capitalists financed the startup with a  investment their basic plan was to build a major firm centering on microelectronics and control system development primarily through acquiring existing companies early yearsedit in october  the first acquisition was made by purchasing the majority of stock in amelco a small electronics manufacturing plant within a short time rights to the name teledyne and its associated logo were bought in addition to amelco two other electronics manufacturing firms were acquired and by the end of  teledyne had about  employees and  square feet  m of floor space devoted to engineering development and manufacturing teledyne stock was first offered to the public in may  during its first full fiscal year of operations ending in october  teledyne had sales of  with a net income of  teledyne’s growth continued in  with the acquisition of companies primarily through equity agreements internally teledyne systems was formed as the centerpiece of the firm’s aerospace systems business diversifying the business base into government contracts with nasa and the us department of defense dod by the end of the second fiscal year teledyne sales had increased  percent and net income by about  percent over the next three years new companies were acquired in microwave and power electrical products – including the first consumer products teledyne controls was established moving the company into the field of hydraulics teledyne entered the optics field with the acquisition of kiernan optics producing windows for the apollo spacecraft and infrared optical domes for missiles in early  teledyne had a major breakthrough in winning a large contract from the us navy for the integrated helicopter avionics system ihas giving teledyne a name in the military market this caused a major jump in the stock price from  to  by the end of the fiscal year teledyne had acquired  companies sales were  million with net income of  million there were about  employees assets reached  million and there were near  million outstanding shares of stock major growth yearsedit a new era for teledyne started in  in june kozmetsky left to become dean of the school of business administration at the university of texas in july vanadiumalloy steel company vasco including its subsidiary allvac was merged into teledyne this expanded the company into the eastern us and started the formation of material technologies as a major business activity of teledyne with the merger singleton turned his position of president over to george a roberts a close friend from naval academy days who had headed vasco singleton now assisted by roberts continued in acquiring new companies in  one of the largest of these was brown engineering a firm with about  employees headquartered in huntsville alabama with nasa and dod contracts for engineering services and research brown engineering added a new line of business for teledyne ryan aeronautical in san diego was acquired in  although not the ryan aeronautical which built charles lindberg’s spirit of st louis in the s ryan was now the largest producer of unmanned drones for the military continental motors was primarily owned by ryan and this acquisition brought teledyne into the pistonpowered engine business with both commercial and military customers in the remainder of the s teledyne acquired some  more companies a number of these businesses were in consumer products such as water pik acoustic research with highfidelity speakers and olson electronics that operated retail stores across america packard bell had both consumer and government sales in computers and television receivers a number of electronic product lines and smaller acquisitions were consolidated in teledyne electronics and teledyne microelectronic technologies two acquired firms geophysical exploration and geotronics brought teledyne into offshore drilling and earthscience instrumentation fields twentyone acquired companies were in the metals business including wah chang and cast products and this led to the acquisition of firms producing industrial machines and machine tools other diverse acquisitions included monarch rubber sewart seacraft isotopes radar relays and getz dental singleton also added a diverse group of financial institutions giving teledyne contact and intimacy with the capital world these included thrift and loan banks and insurance firms dealing with property workers compensation casualty and life insurance most of the insurance investments were later consolidated into the argonaut and unitrin subsidiaries and were ultimately spun off as independent companies teledyne was divided into groups and by the end of the s there were  groups with  profit centers in  locations company presidents were given considerable freedom in their operations but corporate maintained close financial control and capital management teledyne sales in  were  billion and net income was  million the stock had a for split during  and the same split in  as teledyne moved into its second decade some  firms had been acquired singleton then essentially stopped direct acquisition of companies and began investments in stock of technical firms by the end of the second decade teledyne owned  percent of curtisswright  percent of litton as well as significant portions of a number of other wellknown companies this stock was mainly held by the insurance subsidiaries in the “bear” market of the early s teledyne stock fell from about  to less than  singleton saw this as an opportunity to buy back teledyne stock in buybacks from october  to february   million shares were repurchased at  to  – well above the market price this raised the value of teledyne stock eventually increasing to near  at the end of the decade in this period annual income increased by  percent and net income by  percent stockholders who had remained through the buyback achieved a phenomenal gain of about  percent peak and declineedit going into its third decade teledyne sales passed the  billion mark in  with industrial products leading in both sales and net income in the race between the us and the soviet union government sales reached almost  million the first significant slump in teledyne business began in  sales for  had been about  billion but decreased to around  billion the next year and remained essentially flat for the remainder of the decade in april  singleton who was then  years old turned the position of ceo over to roberts but remained as board chairman during  teledyne faced a number of legal problems none of which were the direct result of wrongdoings of singleton or roberts after agreeing to plead guilty to officials in teledyne electronics having made false statements teledyne was fined  million after guiding teledyne for  years singleton retired as an employee and officer in april  nevertheless that was a peak year for teledyne sales  billion and earnings  million teledyne stock price reached  the highest in the nation total employment also peaked at near  henry singleton retired as teledyne chairman in  and was replaced by george roberts william p rutledge was named president and ceo roberts then retired in  and was replaced by rutledge donald b rice previously secretary of the us air force was then named president and ceo many companies had been sold during the prior several years and in  through consolidations the number was further reduced from  to  in january  teledyne electronic systems was sold to litton industries essentially ending the business on which teledyne had originally been formed in the early s while the company underwent these turnovers in leadership two lawsuits were brought against teledyne by whistleblowers under the false claims act the suits charged the company with falsifying test reports for relay devices sold to the us government for weapons and spacecraft use and with padding government contract cost estimates in april  teledyne settled both cases for  million at the time one of the largest settlements by military contractors in a qui tam case in late  teledyne was subjected to a hostile takeover attempt by whx corporation this was successfully challenged but the teledyne pension fund had a surplus of  million and this was of wide interest to forestall further hostile takeovers allegheny ludlum a steel and specialty metal firm offered to serve as a white knight friendly acquirer on august   an agreement was reached to merge teledyne with allegheny ludlum forming allegheny teledyne inc ati with headquarters in pittsburgh pennsylvania after some reorganization ati operated with three segments aerospace and electronics specialty metals and consumer products the former teledyne hightechnology companies were mainly in the ae segment led by robert mehrabian ati eventually decided to spin off the segments into independent entities and on november   teledyne technologies incorporated allegheny technologies incorporated and water pik technologies inc were formed renewaledit with robert mehrabian as chairman ceo and president teledyne technologies or simply teledyne as it is most often called was initially composed of  companies all dating in some form from the original teledyne inc there were about  employees including some  engineers and scientists one of these companies ryan aeronautical was sold to northrop grumman before the end of the year to raise initial operating capital headquarters was initially in the century city district of los angeles but was later moved to one of the citys suburbs thousand oaks in  its first full year of operation teledyne technologies had sales of  million and net income of  million the renewed teledyne operated in much the same manner as singleton’s early teledyne functioning as a conglomerate with growth mainly due to acquisitions in  the sales were  million with net income of  million a cumulative financial growth in the decade of approximately  percent about  percent of the  sales were derived from contracts with agencies of or prime contractors to the us government by the start of  there were near  companies functioning in a wide range of products and services

wisconsin motors teledyne total power historyedit in june  henry singleton and george kozmetsky both previously executives with litton industries formed a firm named instrument systems located in beverly hills california arthur rock one of americas first and most successful venture capitalists financed the startup with a  investment their basic plan was to build a major firm centering on microelectronics and control system development primarily through acquiring existing companies early yearsedit in october  the first acquisition was made by purchasing the majority of stock in amelco a small electronics manufacturing plant within a short time rights to the name teledyne and its associated logo were bought in addition to amelco two other electronics manufacturing firms were acquired and by the end of  teledyne had about  employees and  square feet  m of floor space devoted to engineering development and manufacturing teledyne stock was first offered to the public in may  during its first full fiscal year of operations ending in october  teledyne had sales of  with a net income of  teledyne’s growth continued in  with the acquisition of companies primarily through equity agreements internally teledyne systems was formed as the centerpiece of the firm’s aerospace systems business diversifying the business base into government contracts with nasa and the us department of defense dod by the end of the second fiscal year teledyne sales had increased  percent and net income by about  percent over the next three years new companies were acquired in microwave and power electrical products – including the first consumer products teledyne controls was established moving the company into the field of hydraulics teledyne entered the optics field with the acquisition of kiernan optics producing windows for the apollo spacecraft and infrared optical domes for missiles in early  teledyne had a major breakthrough in winning a large contract from the us navy for the integrated helicopter avionics system ihas giving teledyne a name in the military market this caused a major jump in the stock price from  to  by the end of the fiscal year teledyne had acquired  companies sales were  million with net income of  million there were about  employees assets reached  million and there were near  million outstanding shares of stock major growth yearsedit a new era for teledyne started in  in june kozmetsky left to become dean of the school of business administration at the university of texas in july vanadiumalloy steel company vasco including its subsidiary allvac was merged into teledyne this expanded the company into the eastern us and started the formation of material technologies as a major business activity of teledyne with the merger singleton turned his position of president over to george a roberts a close friend from naval academy days who had headed vasco singleton now assisted by roberts continued in acquiring new companies in  one of the largest of these was brown engineering a firm with about  employees headquartered in huntsville alabama with nasa and dod contracts for engineering services and research brown engineering added a new line of business for teledyne ryan aeronautical in san diego was acquired in  although not the ryan aeronautical which built charles lindberg’s spirit of st louis in the s ryan was now the largest producer of unmanned drones for the military continental motors was primarily owned by ryan and this acquisition brought teledyne into the pistonpowered engine business with both commercial and military customers in the remainder of the s teledyne acquired some  more companies a number of these businesses were in consumer products such as water pik acoustic research with highfidelity speakers and olson electronics that operated retail stores across america packard bell had both consumer and government sales in computers and television receivers a number of electronic product lines and smaller acquisitions were consolidated in teledyne electronics and teledyne microelectronic technologies two acquired firms geophysical exploration and geotronics brought teledyne into offshore drilling and earthscience instrumentation fields twentyone acquired companies were in the metals business including wah chang and cast products and this led to the acquisition of firms producing industrial machines and machine tools other diverse acquisitions included monarch rubber sewart seacraft isotopes radar relays and getz dental singleton also added a diverse group of financial institutions giving teledyne contact and intimacy with the capital world these included thrift and loan banks and insurance firms dealing with property workers compensation casualty and life insurance most of the insurance investments were later consolidated into the argonaut and unitrin subsidiaries and were ultimately spun off as independent companies teledyne was divided into groups and by the end of the s there were  groups with  profit centers in  locations company presidents were given considerable freedom in their operations but corporate maintained close financial control and capital management teledyne sales in  were  billion and net income was  million the stock had a for split during  and the same split in  as teledyne moved into its second decade some  firms had been acquired singleton then essentially stopped direct acquisition of companies and began investments in stock of technical firms by the end of the second decade teledyne owned  percent of curtisswright  percent of litton as well as significant portions of a number of other wellknown companies this stock was mainly held by the insurance subsidiaries in the “bear” market of the early s teledyne stock fell from about  to less than  singleton saw this as an opportunity to buy back teledyne stock in buybacks from october  to february   million shares were repurchased at  to  – well above the market price this raised the value of teledyne stock eventually increasing to near  at the end of the decade in this period annual income increased by  percent and net income by  percent stockholders who had remained through the buyback achieved a phenomenal gain of about  percent peak and declineedit going into its third decade teledyne sales passed the  billion mark in  with industrial products leading in both sales and net income in the race between the us and the soviet union government sales reached almost  million the first significant slump in teledyne business began in  sales for  had been about  billion but decreased to around  billion the next year and remained essentially flat for the remainder of the decade in april  singleton who was then  years old turned the position of ceo over to roberts but remained as board chairman during  teledyne faced a number of legal problems none of which were the direct result of wrongdoings of singleton or roberts after agreeing to plead guilty to officials in teledyne electronics having made false statements teledyne was fined  million after guiding teledyne for  years singleton retired as an employee and officer in april  nevertheless that was a peak year for teledyne sales  billion and earnings  million teledyne stock price reached  the highest in the nation total employment also peaked at near  henry singleton retired as teledyne chairman in  and was replaced by george roberts william p rutledge was named president and ceo roberts then retired in  and was replaced by rutledge donald b rice previously secretary of the us air force was then named president and ceo many companies had been sold during the prior several years and in  through consolidations the number was further reduced from  to  in january  teledyne electronic systems was sold to litton industries essentially ending the business on which teledyne had originally been formed in the early s while the company underwent these turnovers in leadership two lawsuits were brought against teledyne by whistleblowers under the false claims act the suits charged the company with falsifying test reports for relay devices sold to the us government for weapons and spacecraft use and with padding government contract cost estimates in april  teledyne settled both cases for  million at the time one of the largest settlements by military contractors in a qui tam case in late  teledyne was subjected to a hostile takeover attempt by whx corporation this was successfully challenged but the teledyne pension fund had a surplus of  million and this was of wide interest to forestall further hostile takeovers allegheny ludlum a steel and specialty metal firm offered to serve as a white knight friendly acquirer on august   an agreement was reached to merge teledyne with allegheny ludlum forming allegheny teledyne inc ati with headquarters in pittsburgh pennsylvania after some reorganization ati operated with three segments aerospace and electronics specialty metals and consumer products the former teledyne hightechnology companies were mainly in the ae segment led by robert mehrabian ati eventually decided to spin off the segments into independent entities and on november   teledyne technologies incorporated allegheny technologies incorporated and water pik technologies inc were formed renewaledit with robert mehrabian as chairman ceo and president teledyne technologies or simply teledyne as it is most often called was initially composed of  companies all dating in some form from the original teledyne inc there were about  employees including some  engineers and scientists one of these companies ryan aeronautical was sold to northrop grumman before the end of the year to raise initial operating capital headquarters was initially in the century city district of los angeles but was later moved to one of the citys suburbs thousand oaks in  its first full year of operation teledyne technologies had sales of  million and net income of  million the renewed teledyne operated in much the same manner as singleton’s early teledyne functioning as a conglomerate with growth mainly due to acquisitions in  the sales were  million with net income of  million a cumulative financial growth in the decade of approximately  percent about  percent of the  sales were derived from contracts with agencies of or prime contractors to the us government by the start of  there were near  companies functioning in a wide range of products and services referencesedit  allegheny technologies incorporated our history

singleton and george kozmetsky both previously executives with litton industries formed a firm named instrument systems located in beverly hills california arthur rock one of americas first and most successful venture capitalists financed the startup with a  investment their basic plan was to build a major firm centering on microelectronics and control system development primarily through acquiring existing companies early yearsedit in october  the first acquisition was made by purchasing the majority of stock in amelco a small electronics manufacturing plant within a short time rights to the name teledyne and its associated logo were bought in addition to amelco two other electronics manufacturing firms were acquired and by the end of  teledyne had about  employees and  square feet  m of floor space devoted to engineering development and manufacturing teledyne stock was first offered to the public in may  during its first full fiscal year of operations ending in october  teledyne had sales of  with a net income of  teledyne’s growth continued in  with the acquisition of companies primarily through equity agreements internally teledyne systems was formed as the centerpiece of the firm’s aerospace systems business diversifying the business base into government contracts with nasa and the us department of defense dod by the end of the second fiscal year teledyne sales had increased  percent and net income by about  percent over the next three years new companies were acquired in microwave and power electrical products – including the first consumer products teledyne controls was established moving the company into the field of hydraulics teledyne entered the optics field with the acquisition of kiernan optics producing windows for the apollo spacecraft and infrared optical domes for missiles in early  teledyne had a major breakthrough in winning a large contract from the us navy for the integrated helicopter avionics system ihas giving teledyne a name in the military market this caused a major jump in the stock price from  to  by the end of the fiscal year teledyne had acquired  companies sales were  million with net income of  million there were about  employees assets reached  million and there were near  million outstanding shares of stock major growth yearsedit a new era for teledyne started in  in june kozmetsky left to become dean of the school of business administration at the university of texas in july vanadiumalloy steel company vasco including its subsidiary allvac was merged into teledyne this expanded the

roberts a close friend from naval academy days who had headed vasco singleton now assisted by roberts continued in acquiring new companies in  one of the largest of these was brown engineering a firm with about  employees headquartered in huntsville alabama with nasa and dod contracts for engineering services and research brown engineering added a new line of business for teledyne ryan aeronautical in san diego was acquired in  although not the ryan aeronautical which built charles lindberg’s spirit of st louis in the s ryan was now the largest producer of unmanned drones for the military continental motors was primarily owned by ryan and this acquisition brought teledyne into the pistonpowered engine business with both commercial and military customers in the remainder of the s teledyne acquired some  more companies a number of these businesses were in consumer products such as water pik acoustic research with highfidelity speakers and olson electronics that operated retail stores across america packard bell had both consumer and government sales in computers and television receivers a number of electronic product lines and smaller acquisitions were consolidated in teledyne electronics and teledyne microelectronic technologies two acquired firms geophysical exploration and geotronics brought teledyne into offshore drilling and earthscience instrumentation fields twentyone acquired companies were in the metals business including wah chang and cast products and this led to the acquisition of firms producing industrial machines and machine tools other diverse acquisitions included monarch rubber sewart seacraft isotopes radar relays and getz dental singleton also added a diverse group of financial institutions giving teledyne contact and intimacy with the capital world these included thrift and loan banks and insurance firms dealing with property workers compensation casualty and life insurance most of the insurance investments were later consolidated into the argonaut and unitrin subsidiaries and were ultimately spun off as independent companies teledyne was divided into groups and by the end of the s there were  groups with  profit centers in  locations company presidents were given considerable freedom in their operations but corporate maintained close financial control and capital management teledyne sales in  were  billion and net income was  million the stock had a for split during  and the same split in  as teledyne moved into its second decade some  firms had been acquired singleton then essentially stopped direct acquisition of companies and began investments in stock of technical firms by the end of the second decade teledyne owned  percent of curtisswright  percent of litton as well as significant portions of a number of other wellknown companies this stock was mainly held by the insurance subsidiaries in the “bear” market of the early s teledyne stock fell from about  to less than  singleton saw this as an opportunity to buy back teledyne stock in buybacks from october  to february   million shares were repurchased at  to  – well above the market price this raised the value of teledyne stock eventually increasing to near  at the end of the decade in this period annual income increased by  percent and net income by  percent stockholders who had remained through the buyback achieved a phenomenal gain of about  percent peak and declineedit going into its third decade teledyne sales passed the  billion mark in  with industrial products leading in both sales and net income in the race

billion the next year and remained essentially flat for the remainder of the decade in april  singleton who was then  years old turned the position of ceo over to roberts but remained as board chairman during  teledyne faced a number of legal problems none of which were the direct result of wrongdoings of singleton or roberts after agreeing to plead guilty to officials in teledyne electronics having made false statements teledyne was fined  million after guiding teledyne for  years singleton retired as an employee and officer in april  nevertheless that was a peak year for

to litton industries essentially ending the business on which teledyne had originally been formed in the early s while the company underwent these turnovers in leadership two lawsuits were brought against teledyne by whistleblowers under the false claims act the suits charged the company with falsifying test reports for relay devices sold to the us government for weapons and spacecraft use and with padding government contract cost estimates in april  teledyne settled both cases for  million at the time one of the largest settlements by military contractors in a qui tam case in late  teledyne was subjected to a hostile takeover attempt by whx corporation this was successfully challenged but the teledyne pension fund had a surplus of  million and this was of wide interest to
