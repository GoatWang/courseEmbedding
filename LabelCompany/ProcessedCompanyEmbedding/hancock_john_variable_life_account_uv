of benefits and risks the nature of the policy this prospectus describes three types of policies being offered by john hancock a variable whole life policy a variable whole life p  policy and a variable whole life  policy the policies described in this prospectus are available only in new york the minimum death benefit that may be bought is  for the whole life policy  for the whole life p  policy and  for the whole life  policy for the whole life policy and the whole life p  policy all persons insured must meet certain health and other criteria called underwriting standards all persons insured under the whole life  policy must meet preferred risk and nonsmoking underwriting standards all policies may be issued on insured persons between ages of  and  discounts are available to insured persons meeting nonsmoking underwriting criteria the policys primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person the policy is unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle because of the substantial policylevel charges we are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy the value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment options that you choose the amount we pay to the policys beneficiary insured person we call this the death benefit may be similarly affected thats why the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments summary of policy benefits death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person this is called the sum insured when the insured person dies we will pay the death benefit minus any indebtedness the death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the guaranteed minimum death benefit and the variable sum insured on the date of death of the insured person the variable sum insured is an amount equal to the initial sum insured at issue and thereafter varies as discussed under variable sum insured surrender of the policy you may surrender the policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy plus any dividends and interest unpaid or unapplied and the cash value of any insurance purchased under any dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the difference between the gross premium and the net premium for the period beyond the date of surrender less any indebtedness this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a surrender if you have not taken a loan on your policy the cash value of your policy assuming you take all dividend payments in cash will on any given date be equal to o the amount you invested o plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen and o minus all charges we deduct if you take a loan on your policy your cash value will be computed somewhat differently this is discussed under policy loans policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by completing the appropriate form the minimum amount of each loan is  the maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula interest is charged on each loan you can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance you can repay all or part of a loan at any time if there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies it will be deducted from the death benefit policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your cash value and may also result in adverse tax consequences  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th optional benefit riders when you apply for the policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we make available there are a number of such riders charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value investment options the policy offers a number of investment options as listed on the cover of this prospectus they cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies although the funds of the series funds that underlie those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds there are important differences between your investment options and publiclytraded mutual funds on the plus side you can transfer money from one investment option to another without tax liability moreover any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you on the negative side if and when policy earnings are distributed generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains also you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options summary of policy risks lapse risk if you dont pay a premium when due you will have a  day grace period to make that payment if you dont pay the premium by the end of the grace period your policy will terminate ie lapse all coverage under the policy will then cease even if the policy terminates in this way you can still reactivate ie reinstate it within  years from the beginning of the grace period unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted or the period of any extended term coverage discussed below has expired to reinstate the policy you must make the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions since withdrawals reduce your account value withdrawals increase the risk of lapse loans also increase the risk of lapse investment risk as mentioned above the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad your account value will rise or fall based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen some variable investment options are riskier than others these risks and potential rewards are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the series funds transfer risk there is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the frequency of transfers you can make the limitations on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of investment accounts market timing risk variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences as a result some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing inefficiency whatever the reason longterm investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose the investment options underlying fund to increased portfolio transaction costs andor disrupt the fund managers ability to effectively manage the funds investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objectives and policies both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for longterm investment to discourage disruptive frequent trading activity we impose restrictions on transfers see transfers of existing account value and reserve the right to change suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges see how you communicate with us in addition we reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading including but not limited to i restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period ii restricting the dollar amount of transfers  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th and iii restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts we also reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to longterm investors tax risks in order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance under the internal revenue code your policy must comply with certain requirements of the code we will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods the tax laws also contain a socalled  pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policys death benefit if the limit is violated the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences there are also certain treasury department rules referred to as the investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy if that were determined to be the case you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate in other words you would lose the value of the socalled inside buildup that is a major benefit of life insurance there is also a tax risk associated with policy loans although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time of lapse or surrender this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age you might find yourself having to choose between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary there can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership interests for these and all the other reasons mentioned above we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy

level during the policy month following the determination changes in the variable sum insured for each policy month are computed by a formula filed with the insurance supervisory officials of the

limitations on payment of death benefit if the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods the amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy also if an application misstated the age or gender of the insured person we will adjust the amount of any death benefit as described in the policy the account value from each premium payment you make we deduct the charges described under deductions from premium payments below we invest the rest your socalled net premium in the investment options youve elected we invest an amount equal to each net premium for your policy on the date of issue and on each premium due date thereafter even if we actually receive your corresponding premium payment before or after that date over time the amount youve invested in any variable investment option will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount directly in the corresponding fund of the series fund and had reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares except that we will deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your cash value we describe these charges under description of charges at the policy level annual dividends these policies are participating policies which except while in force as fixed extended term insurance are entitled to the share if any of the divisible surplus which we annually determine and apportion to them any share will be distributed as a dividend payable annually on the policy anniversary beginning not later than the end of the second policy year for the variable whole life  policy and not later than the end of the third policy year for the variable whole life policy and variable whole life p policy dividends under participating policies may be described as refunds of premiums which adjust the cost of a policy to the actual level of cost emerging over time after the policys issue thus participating policies generally have gross premiums which are higher than those for comparable nonparticipating policies if a policy is surrendered before dividends become payable you do not benefit from having a participating policy both federal and state law recognize that dividends are considered to be a refund of a portion of the premium paid and therefore are not treated as income for federal or state income tax purposes dividend illustrations published at the time of issue of a policy reflect the actual recent experience of the issuing insurance company with respect to factors such as interest mortality and expenses state law generally prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results state law also requires that dividends must be based on surplus after setting aside certain necessary amounts and that such surplus must be apportioned equitably among participating policies in other words in principle and by statute dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue of a policy each year our actuaries analyze the current and recent past experience and compare it to the assumptions used in determining the premium rates at the time of issue some of the more important data studied includes mortality and withdrawal rates investment yield in the general account and actual expenses incurred in administering the policies such data is then allocated to each dividend class eg by year of issue age smoking habits and plan the actuaries then determine what dividends can be equitably apportioned to each policy class and make a recommendation to our board of directors the board of directors which has the ultimate authority to ascertain dividends will vote the amount of surplus to be apportioned to each policy class thereby authorizing the distribution of each years dividend

restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional limitations noted below subject to the annual restriction noted above our current practice is to restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two per calendar month except with respect to those policies described in the following

close of that business day usually  pm eastern time are considered one transfer you may however transfer to the money market b investment option even if the two transfer per month limit has been reached but only if  of the account value in all variable investment options is transferred to the money market b investment option if such a transfer to the money market b investment option is made then for the  calendar day period after such transfers no transfers from the money market b investment option to any other investment options variable or fixed may be made if your policy offers a dollar cost averaging or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program any transfers pursuant to such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on frequent trading the

to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit plan and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased to match its liabilities under the plan policies sold under these circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions in lieu of the two transfers per month restriction but still subject to the annual restriction noted above we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits i during the  calendar day period after any account values are transferred from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they are transferred into the money market b

options in proportion to the policy cash value allocated to the variable investment options and upon repayment the repayment is allocated to the variable investment options in proportion to the outstanding indebtedness in each variable investment option at such time we determine the variable loan interest rate annually the fixed loan interest rate is  for the life of the policy at the time of issue you can elect which loan interest rate will apply to any policy loan if permitted by the law of the state in which the policy is issued you may change a prior choice of loan interest rate if at the time of such request there is outstanding indebtedness the change will generally become effective on the next policy anniversary the variable loan interest rate determined annually for a policy

instructions to that effect otherwise all payments will be assumed to be premium payments we process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment effects of policy loans the cash value the net cash surrender value and the death benefit are permanently affected by any loan whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part this is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account the investment options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return the amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the outstanding indebtedness equals or exceeds the policys cash value plus any cash values under a dividend option providing paidup insurance the policy will terminate  days after we have mailed notice of termination to you and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period also taking out a loan on the policy increases the

the riders o premium sales charge  a charge not to exceed  of the basic annual premium during the period equal to the lesser of  years or the anticipated life expectancy of the insured person based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality table the basic annual premium is the annual premium less the premiums for any optional rider benefits additional charges for extra mortality risks and

minimum death benefit this charge will vary by age of the insured person but averages approximately  of the basic annual premium o deduction for dividends  a deduction for dividends to be paid or credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date of the policy this deduction will vary by age of the insured person and duration of the policy but is expected to average

of deduction we deduct the monthly charges described in the section from your policys investment options in proportion to the amount of cash value you have in each other charges we could impose in the future we currently make no charge for our federal income taxes however if we incur or expect to incur additional income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the account or this class of policies in future years we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options however we expect that no such charge will be necessary under current laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws we may make charges for such taxes description of charges at the fund level the funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses these fees and expenses shown in the fee tables section are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund therefore they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment

the policies of one issuer over another issuer or one product over another product you should contact your registered representative for more information on compensation arrangements in connection with your purchase of a policy tax considerations this description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances and for further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser federal state and local tax laws regulations and interpretations can change from time to time as a result the tax consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered in some cases retroactively the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if the use of the policy in any such arrangment the value of which depends in part on the tax consequences is contemplated a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advise on the tax attributes of the particular arrangement general generally death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax earnings on your account value are ordinarily not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to you if we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal all or part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and not subjected to income tax however certain distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy benefits within the first  years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily taxable in whole or in part see other policy distributions below amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you see policy loans below however some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract this can happen if youve paid premiums in excess of limits prescribed by the tax laws additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status below policy death benefit proceeds we expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies section  of the internal revenue code the code defines a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes for a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium test these tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the policy we will monitor compliance with these standards if we determine that a policy does not satisfy section  we may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with section  if the policy complies with section  the death benefit proceeds under the policy should be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code other policy distributions increases in policy value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received through actual or deemed distributions in general the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue to comply with the section  definitional limits changes that reduce benefits include partial withdrawals and death benefit option changes for purposes of this rule any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction a cash distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  the taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section f any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner rather than capital gain distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or partial withdrawals you may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th it is possible that despite our monitoring a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the code this could happen for example if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the code if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the disqualification and for subsequent periods tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws will depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary if the person insured by the policy is also its owner either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a revocabale trust the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for purposes of the federal estate tax if the owner is not the person insured the value of the policy will be includible in the owners estate upon his or her death even if ownership has been transferred the death proceeds or the account value may be includible in the former owners estate if the transfer occurred less than three years before the former owners death or if the former owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy you should consult your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences because there may be unfavorable tax consequences including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income taxfree treatment for any death benefit payable to the beneficiary you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests policy loans we expect that except as noted below see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner however if the policy terminates for any reason the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur diversification rules and ownership of the account your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance contract unless the account follows certain rules requiring diversification of investments underlying the policy in addition the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets in certain circumstances the owner of a variable life insurance policy may be considered the owner for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the separate account used to support the policy in those circumstances income and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy owners gross income the internal revenue service irs has stated in published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets a treasury decision issued in  stated that guidance would be issued in the form of regulations or rulings on the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts of a separate account without being treated as owners of the underlying assets as of the date of this prospectus no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued in rev rul  however the irs ruled that a contract holder would not be treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity contract despite the owners ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty subaccounts the ownership rights under your policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described in irs rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings it is possible that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account we do not know what future treasury department regulations or other guidance may require we cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies we have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account but we are under no obligation to do so  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status at the time of policy issuance we will determine whether the planned premium schedule will exceed the pay limit discussed below if so our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that fact the pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully paidup after the payment of  equal annual premiums paidup means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity based on certain prescribed assumptions if the total premiums paid at any time during the first  policy years exceed the pay limit the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules o first all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy at such time o second loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from the policy and taxed accordingly pastdue loan interest that is added to the loan amount is treated as an additional loan o third a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution including distributions on surrender from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan o is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age  o is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled or o is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the policy owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary these exceptions to the  additional tax do not apply in situations where the policy is not owned by an individual furthermore any time there is a material change in a policy the policy will begin a new pay testing period as if it were a newlyissued policy the material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment contract are complex in general however the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time of such change the policy value at the time of the change and the additional premiums paid into the policy during the seven years starting with the date on which the material change occurs moreover if benefits under a policy are reduced such as a reduction in the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits during the  years in which a pay test is being applied the pay limit will generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits if the premiums paid to date are greater than the recalculated pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment contract rules a policy received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract you should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the pay limit on your policy corporate and hr  retirement plans the policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section  of the code if so the code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits thereunder should be carefully scrutinized we are not responsible for compliance with the terms of any such plan or with the requirements of applicable provisions of the code withholding to

relative per share net asset values determined on the date of the substitution in accordance with section  of the act and rule c thereunder each substitution will be effected by having each subaccount that invests in a replaced fund redeem its shares of the replaced fund at the net asset value calculated on the date of the substitution and purchase shares of the appropriate replacing fund at the net asset value calculated on the same date  john hancock and jhvlico will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including all legal accounting and brokerage expenses relating to the substitutions the belowdescribed disclosure documents and this application no costs will be borne directly or indirectly by contract owners  affected contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the substitutions and the substitutions will result in no change in their accumulated values under their contracts nor will the rights or the obligations of john hancock or jhvlico under the contracts or the insurance benefits to contract owners be altered in any way the substitutions will not cause the fees and charges under the contracts currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions start printed page   the substitutions requested in this application will be described in supplements to the applicable prospectuses for the contracts filed with the commission or in other supplemental disclosure documents collectively “supplements” and mailed to all affected contract owners each supplement will give the relevant contract owners notice of each substitution that would affect their respective contracts and will describe the reasons for engaging in that substitution the supplements will also inform existing contract owners with values allocated to a subaccount investing in a replaced fund that no additional amounts may be allocated to the subaccounts that invest in that fund on or after the date of substitution  in addition the affected contract owners will have and the supplements will inform them that they have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value prior to a substitution from the subaccount investing in the replaced fund in that substitution or for  days after a substitution from a subaccount investing in the replacing fund in that substitution to one or more subaccounts investing in other funds available under the applicable contract without the reallocation resulting in any transfer charge or limitation counting toward the lifetime cap or diminishing the number of free transfers that otherwise may be made in a given contract year  each affected contract owner will also be provided with a prospectus for each relevant replacing fund which will accompany or precede the supplement discussed above  within five days after a substitution john hancock and jhvlico each will send to its affected contract owners written confirmation that the substitutions have occurred the confirmations will also identify the shares of the replaced portfolios that have been eliminated and the shares of the replacing portfolios that have been substituted that confirmation will reiterate the free transfer rights disclosed in the supplements that such owners will have previously received  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions applicants legal analysis  according to applicants the legislative history makes it clear that the purpose of section c is to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer applicants state that section c does this by preventing unscrutinized substitutions which might in effect force shareholders dissatisfied with the replacing security to redeem their shares thereby possibly incurring either a loss of any sales load deducted from their original investment an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the redemption proceeds or both  applicants submit that all of the substitutions will benefit contract owners by moving them to funds with lower overall expenses and equal or better performance record and prospects  applicants also contend that the investment characteristics of each replacing fund are very similar to those of the corresponding replaced fund in this connection applicants point out that the hancock international opportunities fund is somewhat more conservative than the templeton developing fund and that the aim vi premier equity fund is somewhat more conservative than the aim vi growth fund however applicants assert that the hancock international fund should not be considered to be either more or less conservative than the templeton foreign fund  applicants assert that the substitutions will be effected in a manner that has no adverse economic consequences for contract owners in this regard applicants will afford affected contract owners protection against increased expenses and changes under terms described in applicants condition  below  applicants note that contract owners who do not wish to participate in a replacing fund will have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value among other available subaccounts without the imposition of any charge or limitation  the substitution from aim vi growth fund is to the much larger aim vi premier equity fund which according to applicants has potential advantages to contract owners in terms of economies of scale and diversification of portfolio investments applicants acknowledge that the templeton developing fund is larger than the hancock international opportunities fund and that the templeton foreign fund is larger than the hancock international fund which would replace it nevertheless applicants point out that even without any reimbursement arrangement the expense ratio of each replaced fund is higher than that of the corresponding replacing fund  to summarize applicants submit a that the substitutions will benefit the affected contract owners and will not entail any of the abuses against which section c is addressed and b that the approvals applicants request under section c are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants conditions as conditions to the approvals that applicants seek  for each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the  months following the date of substitution into the hancock international fund and the hancock international opportunities fund each of john hancock and jhvlico will adjust the contract values invested in either of such funds as a result of the substitutions to the extent necessary to effectively reimburse the affected owners for their proportionate share of any amount by which the annual rate of the replacing funds total operating expenses after any expense waivers or reimbursements for that fiscal period as a percentage of the funds average daily net assets plus the annual rate of any assetbased charges excluding any such charges that are for premium taxes deducted under the terms of the owners contract for that fiscal period exceed the sum of the annualized rate of the corresponding replaced funds total operating expenses as a percentage of such replaced funds average daily net assets for the twelve months ended december   plus the annual rate of any assetbased charges excluding any such charges that are for premium taxes deducted under that contract for such twelve months  for a period of three years following the date of the substitution of the aim vi premier equity fund for the aim vi growth fund neither john hancock nor jhvlico will receive any direct or indirect benefits from aim vi premier equity fund any investment adviser or underwriter to that fund or any “affiliated person” as that term is in section a of the act of any of them that exceed the rate of any benefits that such insurance company directly or indirectly has been receiving from aim vi growth fund any investment adviser or underwriter to that fund or any affiliated person of any of them for this purpose “benefits” shall be construed to include any investment advisory fees payments pursuant to rule b plans shareholder or other service fees start printed page administrative fees revenue sharing payments or other similar payments in connection with assets subject to the substitution whether such benefits are with respect to the aim vi premier equity fund or part of an overall relationship with aim vi funds any investment adviser or underwriter to any of such fund or any affiliated person of any of them in this connection applicants also represent that neither such substitution nor the selection of aim vi premier equity fund as a replacing fund have been motivated by the receipt or promised receipt by john hancock jhvlico or any of their affiliated persons of any benefit or other thing of value from aim vi premier equity fund any investment adviser or underwriter to such fund or any affiliated person of any of them start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority

offered john hancock mutual life insurance company john hancock issues variable life insurance policies the policies described in this prospectus are scheduled annual premium policies that provide for additional premium flexibilities john hancock also issues other forms of variable life insurance policies these other policies are offered by means of other prospectuses but use the same account and underlying fund as explained below the death benefit and surrender value under the policy may increase or decrease daily the policies differ from ordinary fixed benefit life insurance in the way they work however the policies are the same as fixedbenefit life insurance in providing lifetime protection against economic loss resulting from the death of the person insured the policies are primarily insurance and not investments the policies work generally as follows the owner periodically gives john hancock enough premium to meet the premium schedule selected john hancock takes from each premium an amount for expenses taxes and sales load john hancock then places the rest of the premium into as many as ten subaccounts as directed by the owner the assets allocated to each variable subaccount are invested in shares of the corresponding portfolio of the fund the currently available portfolios are identified on the cover of this prospectus the assets allocated to the fixed account are invested in the general account of john hancock during the year john hancock takes charges from each subaccount and credits or charges each subaccount with its respective investment performance the insurance charge which is deducted from the invested assets attributable to each policy account value varies monthly with the then attained age of the insured and with the amount of insurance provided at the start of each month the death benefit may increase or decrease daily depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts to which premiums are allocated in general the current death benefit equals the account value times a factor death benefit factor which depends upon the sex and attained age of the insured if the account value increases the current death benefit will increase and if the account value decreases the current death benefit will decrease however john hancock guarantees that regardless of the investment experience the death benefit payable will never be less than the amount of insurance originally purchased in the absence of a subsequent partial surrender guaranteed death benefit at issue the death benefit payable upon the death of the insured will usually be the guaranteed death benefit this is because the first premium payment generally will not result in a large enough account value to cause the current death benefit to exceed the guaranteed death benefit initially whether or not it reaches or exceeds the guaranteed death benefit depends upon the timing and amount of the premium payments the investment experience the activity under the policy with respect to policy loans additional benefits and the like the charges made against the policy and the attained age of the insured once the current death benefit reaches the guaranteed death benefit the owner bears the investment risk for any amount above the guaranteed death benefit and john hancock bears the investment risk for the guaranteed death benefit the initial account value is basically the sum of the amounts of the premium that john hancock at the direction of the owner places in the account and in the fixed account the account value increases or decreases daily depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts to which the amounts are allocated john hancock does not guarantee a minimum amount of account value therefore the owner bears the investment risk for that portion of the account value allocated to the variable subaccounts the owner may surrender a policy at any time while the insured is living the surrender value is the account value less the  sum of any unpaid issue charge and any contingent deferred sales charge and less any indebtedness if the owner surrenders in the early policy years the amount of surrender value would be low as compared with other investments without sales charges and consequently the insurance protection provided prior to surrender would be costly the minimum initial death benefit that may be bought is  for insureds less than  years of age at the time of issue of the policy and  for insureds with ages  through  at issue all persons insured must meet certain health and other criteria called underwriting standards the smoking status of the insured is generally reflected in the insurance charges made if the minimum death benefit at issue is at least  the insured may be eligible for the preferred class which has the lowest insurance charges for this policy policies issued in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain employee plans will not directly reflect the sex of the insured in either the premium rates or the charges and values under the policy what is the amount of the premiums premiums are determined under one of two premium schedules selected by the owner under the level schedule premiums are fixed for the life of the policy under the modified schedule a lower fixed premium is applicable which does not vary until the policy anniversary nearest the insureds nd birthday on this date in the absence of an earlier election by the owner the policy premium is automatically shifted to the level schedule and a new fixed annual premium becomes payable on a scheduled basis the new premium depends upon the policys guaranteed death benefit and account value at the time of the premium recalculation the owner may request that the premium recalculation take place on any policy anniversary prior to that nearest the insureds nd birthday in addition to the premium schedule chosen the amount of the premium for a policy depends upon the sum insured at issue and the insureds age and sex unless the policy is sexneutral premiums are payable annually or more frequently over the insureds lifetime additional premiums are charged for policies in cases involving extra mortality risks and for additional insurance benefits there is a day grace period in which to make premium payments due after the minimum first premium is received within limits scheduled premiums may be paid in advance and more than the scheduled premiums may be paid if the account value under a policy is sufficiently high a premium payment otherwise scheduled need not be paid see premiums page  what is

taxes but if john hancock incurs or expects to incur income taxes attributable to any subaccount or this class of policies in future years it reserves the right to make a charge john hancock expects that it will continue to be taxed as a life insurance company see charge for john hancocks taxes what is the relationship between the premium and the amount allocated to the subaccounts the initial net premium is allocated by john hancock from its general account to one or more of the subaccounts on the date of issue of the policy the initial net premium is the gross premium less a processing charge the charges deducted for sales expenses and state premium taxes these charges also apply to subsequent premium payments net premiums derived from payments received after the issue date are allocated generally on the date of receipt to one or more of the subaccounts as elected by the owner see charges and expenses page  how are amounts allocated to each subaccount at issue and subsequently thereafter the owner will provide us with the rule investment rule we will follow to invest net premiums or other amounts in any one but not more than ten of the subaccounts the owner may change the investment rule under which john hancock will allocate amounts to subaccounts see investment rule what commissions are paid to agents the policies are sold through agents who are licensed by state authorities to sell john hancocks insurance policies commissions payable to agents are described under distribution of policies sales expenses in any year are not equal to the deduction for sales load including any contingent deferred sales charge in that year rather total sales expenses under the policies are intended to be recovered over the lifetimes of the insureds covered by the policies what is the death benefit the death benefit payable is the greater of the guaranteed death benefit including any extra death benefit value option which may have been exercised or the current death benefit whenever the current death benefit exceeds the guaranteed death benefit the death benefit will increase whenever there is an increase in the policys account value and it will decrease whenever there is a decrease in the policys account value but never below the guaranteed death benefit see death benefits  how does the account value of a policy vary in relation to the subaccounts investment experience in general the account value for any day equals the account value for the previous day increased by any net premium placed in the subaccounts for the policy decreased by any charges made against the account value and increased or decreased by the investment experience of the subaccounts no minimum account value for the policy is guaranteed see surrender value page  what is the loan provision and how does a loan affect the death benefit account value and surrender value after the first policy year the owner may obtain a policy loan assuming no indebtedness see below the maximum amount of any loan in policy years two and three is  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to variable subaccount investments plus  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to fixed account investments thereafter the maximum is  of that portion of surrender value attributable to variable subaccount investments plus  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to fixed account investments interest charged on any loan will accrue daily at an annual rate determined by john hancock at the start of each policy year this interest rate will not exceed the greater of  the published monthly average see loan provision and indebtedness for the calendar month ending two months before the calendar month of the policy anniversary or   a loan plus accrued interest indebtedness may be repaid at the discretion of the owner in whole or in part in accordance with the terms of the policy while a loan is outstanding the rate of interest credited to the account value because of the loan will usually be different than the net investment experience of the subaccounts therefore the account value the surrender value and any death benefit above the guaranteed death benefit are permanently affected by any loan is there a shortterm cancellation right the owner may surrender a policy by delivering or mailing it within  days after the date of part a of the application or within  days after receipt of the policy by the owner or within  days after mailing by john hancock of the notice of withdrawal right whichever is latest to john hancock at boston massachusetts or to the agent or agency office through which it was delivered any premium paid on it will be refunded if required by state law the refund will equal the account value at the end

take effect at the end of the valuation period in which john hancock receives at its home office notice satisfactory to john hancock see exchange privilege page  are the benefits under a policy subject to federal income tax there has been a determination by the internal revenue service that death benefits payable under variable life insurance policies which appear to be similar to those described in this prospectus in all material respects are excludable from the beneficiarys gross income for federal income tax purposes it is also believed that an  owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the cash values of the policy until values are actually received through withdrawal surrender or other distributions the benefits under policies described in this prospectus are expected to receive the same tax treatment under the internal revenue code of  as benefits under traditional fixedbenefit life insurance policies under recent federal tax legislation distributions from policies entered into after june   on which premiums greater than a pay premium limit as defined in the law have been paid will be subject to taxation see flexibility as to premium payments for a

and the statement of additional information referred to therein which should be read together with this prospectus  the fixed account an owner may allocate premiums to the fixed account or transfer all or part of the account value under a policy to the fixed account the amount so allocated or transferred will become a part of john hancocks general account assets john hancocks general account consists of assets owned by john hancock other than those in the account and in other separate accounts that have been or may be established by john hancock subject to applicable law john hancock has sole discretion over the investment of assets of the general account and owners do not share in the investment experience of those assets instead john hancock guarantees that the account value allocated to the fixed account will accrue interest daily at an effective annual rate of at least  without regard to the actual investment experience of the general account consequently if an owner pays the scheduled premiums allocates all net premiums only to the fixed account and makes no transfers partial withdrawals or policy loans the minimum amount and duration of the death benefit will be determinable and guaranteed transfers from the fixed account are subject to certain limitations see transfers among subaccounts and charges will vary somewhat for account value allocated to the fixed account see charges deducted from account value the account value in the fixed account is equal to the portion of the net premiums allocated to it plus any amounts transferred to it and interest credited to it minus any charges deducted from it or partial withdrawals or amounts transferred from it john hancock guarantees that interest credited to the account value in the fixed account will not be less than an effective annual rate of  john hancock may in its sole discretion credit a higher rate although it is not obligated to do so the owner assumes the risk that interest credited will not exceed  per year upon request and in the annual statement john hancock will inform owners of the thenapplicable rate because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions interests in john hancocks general account have not been registered under the securities act of  and the general account has not been registered as an investment company under the  act accordingly neither the general account nor any interests therein are subject to the provisions of these acts and john hancock has been advised that the staff of the securities and exchange commission has not reviewed the disclosure in this prospectus relating to the fixed account disclosure regarding the fixed account may however be subject to certain generallyapplicable provisions of the federal securities laws relating to accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses policy provisions and benefits the discussions which follow under death benefits account value and surrender value assume that there has been no policy loan benefits and values are affected if premiums are not paid as scheduled or if a policy loan is made for the effect of a default in payment of premiums see default and options on lapse and of a loan see loan provision and indebtedness requirements for issuance of policy the policy is generally available with a minimum sum insured at issue of  for insureds less than  years of age at the time of issue of the policy and minimum sum insured at issue of  for insureds with ages  through  at issue all persons insured must meet certain health and other criteria called underwriting standards the smoking status of the insured is reflected in the insurance charges made if the sum insured at issue is at least  the insured may be eligible for the preferred underwriting class of this policy which has the lowest insurance charges policies issued in connection with certain employee plans will not  directly reflect the sex of the insured in either the premium rates or the charges or values under the policy accordingly the illustrations factors and premiums set forth in this prospectus may differ for such policies premiums payment schedule premiums are scheduled and payable during the lifetime of the insured in accordance with john hancocks established rules and rates premiums are payable at john hancocks home office on or before the due date specified in the policy all policies operate under the same schedule of due dates after the payment of the minimum first premium see minimum premium requirements below there are three scheduled due dates in the first policy year due dates are the last valuation date in the third sixth and ninth policy months in the second policy year the scheduled due dates are the last valuation date in the sixth and twelfth policy months in the third and all later policy years the scheduled due date is the last valuation date of the policy year minimum premium requirements an amount of required premium see amount of required premium below is determined at the start of each policy year generally the full amount of required premium must be paid by the last scheduled due date of the policy year in the first and second policy years however there are additional requirements in the first policy year a minimum first premium must be received by john hancock at its home office before the policy is in full force and effect the minimum first premium is equal to the greater of  or onefourth of the required premium also in the first policy year onehalf of the required premium must be received on or before the last valuation date in the third policy month and threequarters of the required premium must be received on or before the last valuation date in the sixth policy month in the second policy year onehalf of the required premium for the second policy year must be received on or before the last valuation date in the sixth policy month premium requirements are met by premium payments on a cumulative basis for example the premium requirement on all scheduled due dates of the first policy year would be met if the full required premium for the first policy year were paid at issue of the policy generally all premiums received are counted by john hancock when it determines whether the premium requirement is met on a scheduled due date this cumulative amount of premiums received is reduced for this purpose by amounts withdrawn from the premium component of excess value and amounts applied from the premium component to any value option other than the accumulate option the premium requirement will also be deemed satisfied on the last valuation date of the second or any later policy year if any excess value is available on the scheduled due date see value options failure to satisfy a premium requirement on a scheduled due date may cause the policy to terminate see default and options on lapse amount of required premium the required premium determined at the start of each policy year equals an amount for the basic death benefit basic premium or  if the annual basic premium is less than  plus any additional premium  because the insured is an extra mortality risk or because additional insurance benefits have been purchased the basic premium is a level amount that does not change if the level schedule is selected if the modified schedule is selected the basic premium does not change until the premium recalculation occurs see choice of premium schedule and premium recalculation if the account value on the valuation date immediately preceding the policy anniversary when multiplied by the death benefit factor on that policy anniversary  is equal to or greater than the guaranteed death benefit then no required premium is applicable to the following policy year this means that even if no premium is paid during the policy year the premium requirement will be met on the scheduled due date at the end of the policy year if applicable owners will be mailed a written notice by john hancock within  days after any policy anniversary that no premium payment is required in that policy year choice of premium schedule at the time of application the applicant can select either a level schedule or a modified schedule as the basis for the basic premium on the policy the modified schedule alternative is not available if the insured is over age  on the issue date of the policy if the level schedule is chosen the basic premium will never increase during the lifetime of the insured with the level schedule the basic premium is completely insulated from any adverse investment performance if the modified schedule is chosen the basic premium is initially lower than under the level schedule however a premium recalculation described below must occur no later than the policy anniversary nearest the insureds nd birthday at the time of the premium recalculation john hancock determines a new basic premium which is payable through the remaining lifetime of the insured a comparison of the basic premiums at issue under the level and modified schedules for a sum insured at issue of  for a male is shown below issue age level modified               premium recalculation modified schedule only the premium recalculation applicable to any policy on a modified schedule may be elected by the owner at any time after the first policy anniversary up to the policy anniversary nearest the insureds nd birthday if elected the premium recalculation will be effected on the policy anniversary next following receipt by john hancock at its home office of satisfactory written notice if not elected sooner the premium recalculation will be effected by john hancock on the policy anniversary nearest the insureds nd birthday the new basic premium resulting from a premium recalculation may be less than equal to or greater than the original basic premium but it will never exceed the maximum basic premium shown in the policy the new basic premium depends on the insureds sex and age the guaranteed death benefit under the policy and the account value on the valuation date immediately preceding the date of the premium recalculation a charge will be made if the new basic premium is below the basic premium on the level schedule for the insureds age at issue of the policy the charge currently   will not exceed  of the amount of account value applied by john hancock to reduce the new basic premium to an amount below the basic premium which would have been payable on the level schedule for the insureds age at issue see guaranteed death benefit charges  billing allocation of premium payments investment rule the owner may at any time elect to be billed by john hancock for an amount of premium greater than the required premium otherwise payable the owner may also elect to be billed for premiums on an annual semiannual or quarterly basis an automatic checkwriting program may be available to an owner interested in making monthly premium payments a premium processing charge not to exceed  is deducted from each premium payment all premiums are payable at john hancocks home office any premium payment will be processed by john hancock as of the end of the valuation period in which it is received unless one of the three exceptions noted below is applicable each premium payment will be reduced first by the premium processing charge and then by the state premium tax charge and the sales charge deducted from premiums see charges and expenses the remainder is the net premium the owner at the time of application must elect an investment rule which will allocate net premiums and any credits to any of the ten subaccounts the owner must select allocation percentages in whole numbers and the total allocated must equal  the owner may thereafter change the investment rule prospectively at any time the change will be effective as to any net premiums and credits applied after receipt at john hancocks home office of notice satisfactory to john hancock there are three exceptions to the normal practice of processing a premium payment as of the end of the valuation period in which it is received  a payment received prior to a policys issue date will be processed as if received on the valuation date immediately preceding the issue date  a payment made during a policys grace period will be processed as of the scheduled due date to the extent it represents the amount of premium in default any excess will be processed as of the date of receipt  if the minimum first premium is not received prior to the issue date each payment received thereafter will be processed as if received on the valuation date immediately preceding the issue date until all of the minimum first premium is received flexibility as to premium payments the owner may pay more than the required premium during a policy year and may ask to be billed for an amount greater than any required premium the owner may also pay amounts in addition to any billed amount however each premium payment must be at least  john hancock reserves the right to limit premium payments above the amount of the cumulative required premiums due on the policy the ability to pay more than the required premium provides the owner with considerable payment flexibility in meeting the premium requirements of the policy consider a policy with a  required premium and where the owner pays  in each of the first eight policy years if none of the additional premium of  is applied under a value option see value options the policy will remain in force for at least ten years without any further premium payments during each of these ten years the premium received  a year for eight years at least equals the aggregate required premiums  a year for  years on the scheduled due dates in other words the payment of more than the required premium in a year can be relied upon to satisfy the required premium requirements in later years if however the owner were to apply  of the additional premium to a value option then only  would remain to meet required premiums the policy would remain in force for at least  years but a payment of  may be necessary by the end of the tenth policy year to keep the policy in force  recent federal legislation has modified the tax treatment of certain policy distributions such as loans surrenders partial surrenders and withdrawals the application of this modified treatment to any owner depends upon whether premiums have been paid that exceed a pay premium as defined in the law the pay premium is greater than the required premium on the policy but is generally less than the amount an owner may choose to pay and john hancock will accept if the total premium paid exceeds the pay limitation the owner will be subject to the new tax rules on any distributions made from the policy a material change in the policy will result in a new pay limitation and test period a reduction in death benefit within the seven year period following issuance of or a material change in the policy may also result in the application of the modified endowment treatment see policy proceeds under tax considerations account value and surrender value amount of account value the account value increases or decreases depending upon a number of factors such as the applicable subaccounts investment experience the proportion of the account value invested in each subaccount and the interest credited to any loan account in general the account value for any day equals the account value for the previous day decreased by charges against the account value increased or decreased by the investment experience of the subaccounts and increased by net premiums received no minimum amount of account value is guaranteed a policy loan will not affect the total amount of account value at the time the loan is made but will result in a different rate of return being credited to the loan account portion of the account value amount of surrender value the surrender value will be the account value less the sum of any unpaid issue charge and any contingent deferred sales charge and less any indebtedness the contingent deferred sales charge is deducted from the account value upon surrender of the policy during the first eleven policy years after issue the amount of this charge is set forth in a schedule under sales charges the total charge for sales expenses including the contingent deferred sales charge over the lesser of  years or the life expectancy of the insured will not exceed  of the payments under the policy over that period when policy may be surrendered a policy may be surrendered for its surrender value at any time while the insured is living surrender takes effect and the surrender value is determined as of the end of the valuation period in which occurs the later of receipt at john hancocks home office of a signed request and the surrendered policy when part of policy may be surrendered a policy may be partially surrendered upon submission of a written request satisfactory to john hancock in accordance with its rules currently the policy after partial surrender must have a sum insured at least as large as the minimum amount for which john hancock would issue a policy on the life of the insured the guaranteed death benefit for the policy will be adjusted to reflect the new sum insured a pro rata portion of any contingent deferred sales charge will be deducted a possible alternative to the partial surrender of a policy is the withdrawal of excess value see value options death benefits the death benefit payable is the greater of the guaranteed death benefit including any extra death benefit or the current death benefit  guaranteed death benefit the guaranteed death benefit at any time is the sum of the basic death benefit and any extra death benefit the basic death benefit at issue of the policy is the same as the sum insured at issue shown in the policy thereafter the basic death benefit may be reduced by a partial surrender on request of the owner john hancock guarantees that regardless of the investment experience of the subaccounts the death benefit will never be less than the guaranteed death benefit extra death benefit an extra death benefit may be available from time to time on policy anniversaries if the owner exercises an extra death benefit value option on a policy anniversary the amount of extra death benefit produced under the option becomes a guaranteed death benefit the amount of any extra death benefit depends upon the account value benchmark value see value options and the sex and age of the insured on the policy anniversary as of which the option is exercised see value options the insureds age on a policy anniversary is the age of the insured on his or her birthday nearest that date current death benefit the current death benefit on any date is the account value at the end of the valuation period containing that date times the death benefit factor shown in the policy the death benefit factor depends upon the sex and the then attained age of the insured the death benefit factor decreases from year to year as the attained age of the insured increases for example the death benefit factor for a male age  is  for a male age  is  a complete list of death benefit factors is set forth in the policy the current death benefit is variable it increases as the account value increases and decreases as the account value decreases value options as of the last valuation date in each policy year the account value of the policy will be compared against an amount the benchmark value described below to determine if any excess value exists under the policy any excess value will be applied according to the election made in the application for the policy or in a written notice from the owner after issue of the policy the benchmark value depends upon the policys guaranteed death benefit the required premium any indebtedness the sex and attained age of the insured and any surrender charge the formula describing precisely how benchmark value is calculated on each policy anniversary is set forth in the policy under excess value in general the benchmark value increases as more guarantees are provided in the policy either in the form of higher guaranteed death benefits or lower premiums the benchmark value is also not less than  of any indebtedness the benchmark value generally increases as the attained age of the insured increases excess value is any amount of account value greater than benchmark value excess value may arise from two sources the premium component is excess value up to the amount by which the cumulative premiums paid excluding amounts from this component previously withdrawn or applied under certain value options exceed the cumulative sum of required premiums the premium component may be zero the experience component is any amount of excess value above the premium component and arises out of favorable investment experience or lower than maximum insurance and expense charges if excess value is available on a policy anniversary any premium component and experience component will be applied under value options elected by the owner either component may be applied to any available value option except that the premium component must be applied to the accumulate option until the second policy anniversary the amounts to be applied will be determined in accordance with the owners election and in accordance with the then current john hancock rules a change in an election will be effective as of the policy anniversary next following its date of receipt in writing by john hancock at its home office or if subject to  underwriting rules its date of approval any change in election does not affect amounts previously applied under any value option the policy includes three value options the accumulate option leaves any excess value in the account value and does not affect the guarantees under the policy the accumulate option is available on both premium schedules and no limit is placed on the amount that may be applied from either the premium component or the experience component the extra death benefit option increases the amount of guaranteed death benefit the extra death benefit option is available on both premium schedules no limit is placed on the amount that may be applied from the experience component the amount that may be applied from the premium component is limited to an amount that depends upon the sum insured at issue and the insureds age at issue of the policy amounts applied from the premium component reduce the cumulative amount of premiums received under the policy for purposes of determining whether the policy will continue to remain in force a guaranteed death benefit charge see charges and expenses is made against the account value to cover the risk assumed by john hancock in providing the increased guaranteed death benefit the extra death benefit value option may not be available if the insured is an extra mortality risk the increase in guaranteed death benefit equals the amount applied less the guaranteed death benefit charge times the death benefit factor shown in the policy an increase in the guaranteed death benefit may increase the amount at risk under the policy which would increase the amount of the insurance charge see charges deducted from account value the owner may decrease the amount of any extra death benefit on the policy depending upon the amount of account value under a policy a decrease may result in an amount of excess value which may be taken by the owner as a partial withdrawal see partial withdrawal of excess value any decrease is effective at the end of the valuation period in which john hancock receives written notice of the request the basic premium reduction option permanently decreases the amount of the basic premium that would otherwise have to be paid in a policy year to avoid a lapse at the end of the year the basic premium reduction option is available only on the level schedule no limit is currently placed on the amount that may be applied from either component except that the basic premium may not be reduced below zero amounts applied from the premium component reduce the cumulative amounts of premiums received under the policy for purposes of determining whether the policy will continue to remain in force a guaranteed death benefit charge see charges and expenses is made against the account value to cover the risk assumed by john hancock that the guaranteed death benefit will remain in effect notwithstanding the lower future premiums the reduction in basic premium equals the amount applied less the guaranteed death benefit charge divided by the premium credit factor shown in the policy the premium credit factor depends upon the sex and the then attained age of the insured the premium credit factor decreases from year to year as the attained age of the insured increases for example the premium credit factor for a female age  is  for a female age  is  partial withdrawal of excess value under john hancocks current administrative rules an owner may withdraw excess value from the policy on or after the first policy anniversary this privilege which reduces the account value by the amount of the withdrawal and the associated charge may be exercised only once in a policy year and will be effective as of the end of the valuation period in which john hancock receives written notice satisfactory to it at its home office the minimum amount that may be withdrawn is  unless the current death benefit exceeds the  guaranteed death benefit a partial withdrawal will not affect the death benefit payable an amount equal to the lesser of  or  of the amount withdrawn is charged against account value for each partial withdrawal an amount equal to the excess value withdrawn will be removed from each subaccount in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among the subaccounts a partial withdrawal is not a loan and once made cannot be repaid no contingent deferred sales charge is deducted upon a partial withdrawal amounts withdrawn from the premium component reduce the cumulative amount of premiums received for purposes of determining whether the premium requirements of the policy have been met on a modified schedule because the account value is reduced by a partial withdrawal the premium that results from the premium recalculation will be higher because of the partial withdrawal transfers among subaccounts the owner may reallocate the amounts held for the policy in the subaccounts up to twelve times in each policy year with no charge if any additional transfers in a policy year are permitted john hancock may impose a charge of not more than  against account value for each additional transfer the owner may either  use percentages in whole numbers to be transferred among subaccounts or  designate the dollar amount of funds to be transferred among subaccounts the reallocation must be such that the total in the subaccounts after reallocation equals  of account value transfers out of a variable subaccount will be effective at the end of the valuation period in which john hancock receives at its home office notice satisfactory to john hancock transfers out of the fixed account to the variable subaccounts are permitted only once each policy year and only during the day period beginning on the policy anniversary transfers out of the fixed account may be requested from  days before to  days after the policy anniversary if received on or before the policy anniversary requests for transfer out of the fixed account will be processed on the policy anniversary or the next valuation date if the policy anniversary does not occur on a valuation date if received after the policy anniversary they will be processed at the end of the valuation period in which john hancock receives the request at its home office john hancock reserves the right to defer such fixed account transfers for six months transfers among variable subaccounts and transfers into the fixed account may be requested at any time a maximum of  of fixed account assets or if greater  may be transferred out of the fixed account in any policy year currently there is no minimum amount limit on transfers out of the fixed account but john hancock reserves the right to impose such a limit in the future if the owner requests a reallocation which would result in amounts being held in more than ten subaccounts such reallocation will not be effective and a revised reallocation may be chosen in order that amounts will be reallocated to no more than ten subaccounts if an owner requests a transfer out of the fixed account  days or more prior to the policy anniversary that portion of the reallocation will not be processed and the owners confirmation statement will not reflect a transfer out of the fixed account as to such request telephone transfers and policy loans once a written authorization is completed by the owner the owner may request a transfer or policy loan by telephoning  during periods of heavy telephone usage implementing a telephone transfer or policy loan may be difficult if an owner is unable to reach john hancock via the above number the owner should send a written request via fax to  any requests via fax are considered telephone requests and are bound by the conditions in the owners signed telephone authorization form any fax request should include the owners name daytime telephone number policy number and in the case of transfers the names of the subaccounts from which and to which money will be transferred the right to discontinue telephone transactions at any time without notice to owners is specifically reserved an owner who authorizes telephone transactions will be liable for any loss expense or cost arising out of any unauthorized or fraudulent telephone instructions which john hancock reasonably believes to be genuine  john hancock employs procedures which include requiring personal identification tape recording calls and providing written confirmation to the owner if john hancock does not employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone are genuine it may be liable for any loss due to unauthorized or fraudulent instruction loan provisions and indebtedness loan provision loans may be made at any time a loan value is available after the first policy year the owner may borrow money assigning the policy as the only security for the loan by completion of a form satisfactory to john hancock or if the telephone transaction authorization form has been completed by telephone assuming no outstanding indebtedness in policy years two and three the loan value will be  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to the variable subaccount investments plus  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to fixed account investments and in later policy years  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to variable subaccount investments plus  of that portion of the surrender value attributable to fixed account investments interest charged on any loan will accrue daily at an annual rate determined by john hancock at the start of each policy year this interest rate will not exceed the greater of  the published monthly average defined below for the calendar month ending  months before the calendar month of the policy anniversary or   the published monthly average means moodys corporate bond yield average monthly average corporates as published by moodys investors service inc or if the average is no longer published a substantially similar average established by the insurance regulator where the policy is issued the amount of any outstanding loan plus accrued interest is called the indebtedness except when used to pay premiums a loan will not be permitted unless it is at least  the owner may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness while the insured is living and premiums are being duly paid when a loan is made an amount equal to the loan proceeds will be transferred out of the account and the fixed account as applicable this amount is allocated to the loan account a portion of john hancocks general account each subaccount will be reduced in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among the subaccounts upon each loan repayment the same proportionate amount of the entire loan as was borrowed from the fixed account will be repaid to the fixed account the remainder of the loan repayment will be allocated to the appropriate subaccounts as stipulated in the current investment rule for example if the entire loan outstanding is  of which  was borrrowed from the fixed account then upon a repayment of   would be allocated to the fixed account and the remaining  would be allocated to the appropriate subaccounts as stipulated in the current investment rule effect of loan and indebtedness a loan does not directly affect the amount of the required premium while the indebtedness is outstanding that portion of the account value that is in the loan account is credited interest at a rate that is  less than the loan interest rate for the first  policy years and thereafter  less than the loan interest rate this rate will usually be different than the net return for the subaccounts since the loan account and the remaining portion of the account value will generally have different rates of investment return any death benefit above the guaranteed death benefit the account value and the surrender value are permanently affected by an indebtedness whether or not repaid in whole or in part the amount of any indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the indebtedness equals or exceeds the surrender value the policy terminates  days after notice has been mailed by john hancock to the owner and any assignee of record at their last known addresses unless a repayment of the excess indebtedness is made within that period default and options on lapse premium grace period default and lapse any amount of premium required to keep the policy in force is in default if not paid on or before its scheduled due date but the policy provides a day grace period for the  payment of each such amount this grace period does not apply to the receipt of the minimum first premium the insurance continues in full force during the grace period but if the insured dies during the grace period the amount in default is deducted from the death benefit otherwise payable written notice will be furnished to the owner at his or her last known address at least  days prior to the end of the grace period specifying the minimum amount which must be paid to continue the policy in force on a premium paying basis after the end of the grace period if a payment at least equal to the amount in default is not received by the end of the grace period the policy will lapse if payment by the owner of an amount at least equal to the amount in default is received prior to the end of the grace period the policy will no longer be in default the portion of the payment equal to the amount in default will be processed as if it had been received the day it was due any excess payment will be processed as of the end of the valuation period in which it is received see premium payments options on lapse if a policy lapses the surrender value on the date of lapse is applied under one of the following options for continued insurance not requiring further payment of premiums these options provide for variable or fixed paidup insurance or fixed extended term insurance on the life of the insured commencing on the date of lapse both the variable and fixed paidup insurance options provide an amount of paidup whole life insurance determined in accordance with the policy which the surrender value will purchase the amount of variable paidup insurance  minimum may then increase or decrease subject to any guarantee in accordance with the investment experience of the subaccounts the fixed paid up insurance option provides a fixed and level amount of insurance the fixed extended term insurance option provides a fixed amount of insurance determined in accordance with the policy with the insurance coverage continuing for as long a period as the available policy values will purchase if no option has been elected before the end of the grace period the fixed extended term insurance option automatically applies unless the amount of fixed paidup insurance would equal or exceed the amount of fixed extended term insurance or unless the insured is a substandard risk in either of which cases fixed paidup insurance is provided exchange privilege the owner may transfer the entire account value under the policy to the fixed account at any time creating a nonvariable policy the exchange will be effective at the end of the valuation period in which john hancock receives at its home office notice of the transfer satisfactory to john hancock the foregoing description of policy provisions is qualified by reference to the specimen policy which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement charges and expenses charges deducted from premiums in addition to part of the sales charge see sales charges below the following charges are deducted from premiums premium processing charge a charge not to exceed  will be deducted from each premium payment for collection and processing costs policyholders who pay premiums annually will incur lower aggregate  processing charges than those who pay premiums more frequently the processing charge is currently  but may be different for payments made under special billing arrangements acceptable to john hancock state premium tax charge a charge equal to   of each premium payment after the deduction of the premium processing charge will be deducted from each premium payment except in any state where a lower charge is required premium taxes vary from state to state the   rate is the average rate expected to be paid on premiums received in all states over the lifetimes of the insureds covered by the policies sales charges charges are made to compensate john hancock for the cost of selling the policy this cost includes agents commissions advertising and the printing of the prospectuses and sales literature the amount of the charge in any policy year cannot be specifically related to sales expenses for that year john hancock expects to recover its total sales expenses over the period the policies are in effect to the extent that sales load charges are insufficient to cover total sales expenses the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains with respect to the policies or from john hancocks general assets see distribution of policies part of the sales charge is deducted from each premium payment received this amount is  of the premium after deduction of the premium processing charge john hancock will waive the portion of the sales charge otherwise to be deducted from each premium paid on a policy with a current sum insured of  or higher the continuation of this waiver is not contractually guaranteed and the waiver may be withdrawn or modified by john hancock at some future date the remainder of the sales charge will be deducted only if the policy is surrendered or stays in default past its grace period this second part is the contingent deferred sales charge the contingent deferred sales charge however will not be deducted for a policy that lapses or is surrendered on or after the policys eleventh anniversary and it will be reduced for a policy that lapses or is surrendered between the end of the seventh policy year and the end of the eleventh policy year the contingent deferred sales charge is a percentage of the lesser of a the total amount of premiums paid before the date of surrender or lapse and b the sum of the modified premiums or portions thereof due on or before the date of surrender or lapse maximum contingent deferred sales charge as a percentage of modified premiums due through effective for surrenders or lapses effective during date of surrender or lapse   policy years   policy year   policy year   policy year   policy year   policy year   policy year  and later   a slightly lower percentage than that shown applies in the last valuation period of policy years  through   the amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is calculated on the basis of the premium under the modified schedule for the age of the insured at the time of issue of the policy regardless of whether the policy uses the level schedule or the modified schedule at issue ages above  however where only the level schedule is available the contingent deferred sales charge depends on the premium under that schedule also lower percentages apply at higher issue ages the absence of any need to pay a required premium because of the adequacy of the account value on a policy anniversary does not impact the amount of modified premiums deemed to have been due to date for purposes of the contingent deferred sales charge for example if the size of the account value is sufficiently large that the required premium for the fifth policy year otherwise payable need not be paid and the owner surrenders the policy at the end of the policy year the contingent deferred sales charge would be based on the sum of five modified premiums on the policy or if less the total amount of premiums actually paid during all five policy years similarly if a premium recalculation is required or effected ie from modified to level schedule or a premium reduction is implemented the amount of premiums due to the date of any subsequent surrender or lapse for purposes of calculating the contingent deferred sales charge will continue to be based on the premium schedule in effect prior to such recalculation or reduction the contingent deferred sales charge reaches its maximum at the end of the sixth policy year and equals this amount for the entire seventh policy year the contingent deferred sales charge is reduced in each policy year after the seventh at issue ages higher than age  the maximum is reached at an earlier policy year eg the end of the fifth policy year at issue age  and may be reduced to zero over a shorter number of years reduced charges for eligible groups the sales charges and issue charge described below otherwise applicable may be reduced with respect to policies issued to a class of associated individuals or to a trustee employer or similar entity where john hancock anticipates that the sales to the members of the class will result in lower than normal sales and administrative expenses these reductions will be made in accordance with john hancocks rules in effect at the time of the application for a policy the factors considered by john hancock in determining the eligibility of a particular group for reduced charges and the level of the reduction are as follows the nature of the association and its organizational framework the method by which sales will be made to the members of the class the facility with which premiums will be collected from the associated individuals and the associations capabilities with respect to administrative tasks the anticipated persistency of the policies the size of the class of associated individuals and the number of years it has been in existence and any other such circumstances which justify a reduction in sales or administrative expenses any reduction will be reasonable and will apply uniformly to all prospective policy purchasers in the class and will not be unfairly discriminatory to the interests of any policyowner charges deducted from account value in addition to the possible transfer charge discussed above under transfers among subaccounts the following charges are deducted from account value issue charge john hancock will deduct from account value a charge  per policy and c per  of the sum insured at issue to compensate john hancock for expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the policy other than sales expenses such expenses include medical examinations insurance underwriting costs and costs incurred in processing applications and establishing permanent policy records for a policy with a  sum insured at issue the total issue charge would be   this charge is fully assessed upon the issuance of the policy but will be deducted from the account value in  equal monthly installments on the date of issue and on the first day of each subsequent policy month john hancock will deduct  per policy and c per  of the sum insured at issue for each month that john hancock is unable to deduct the charge because there is insufficient account value the period over which john hancock will make this deduction will be extended by one month if a policy lapses or is surrendered before the issue charge has been fully recovered the unpaid balance is part of the surrender charge if a policy terminates by reason of the death of the insured the unpaid balance will not reduce the death benefit the unpaid issue charge also reduces the amount that may be borrowed through a policy loan maintenance charge john hancock will deduct from the account value a charge equal to  per policy and c per  of the current sum insured for a policy with a sum insured at issue of  the maintenance charge deducted during a policy year would be  this charge is to compensate john hancock for administrative expenses including recordkeeping processing death claims and surrenders making policy changes reporting and other communications to owners and other similar expense and overhead costs the maximum maintenance charge currently is  no matter how large a policys current sum insured based on the current monthly charge this maximum will benefit all policies which will have a current sum insured above  policies with a sum insured below this amount are not affected by the maximum this current maximum is not contractually guaranteed and may be withdrawn or modified by john hancock at some future date insurance charge the insurance charge deducted monthly from account value is based on the attained age of the insured and the amount at risk the amount at risk is the difference between the death benefit and the account value the amount of the insurance charge is determined by multiplying john hancocks then current monthly rate for insurance by the amount at risk current monthly rates for insurance are based on the sex age and underwriting class of the insured john hancock may change these rates from time to time but they will never be more than the guaranteed maximum rates based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables set forth in the policy lower current insurance rates are offered at most ages for insureds who qualify as nonsmokers to qualify an insured must meet additional requirements that relate to smoking habits and be age  or over insureds who are under  years of age may ask us to review their current smoking habits after they reach their th birthday john hancock will also charge lower current insurance rates under a policy with a current sum insured of  or higher if the insured is over age  in the standard underwriting class or the insured is over age  in the preferred underwriting class these lower current insurance rates are not contractually guaranteed and may be withdrawn or modified by john hancock at some future date guaranteed death benefit charges john hancock deducts a charge from that portion of the account value attributable to the variable subaccounts for the minimum death benefit that has been guaranteed john hancock guarantees that the death benefit will never be less than the sum insured in return for making this guarantee john hancock currently makes a monthly charge of c per  of the current sum insured this charge may be increased by john hancock but will never exceed c per  of the current sum insured  when an extra death benefit value option is exercised john hancock guarantees a higher guaranteed death benefit when a basic premium reduction value option is exercised john hancock provides the same guaranteed death benefit with less premiums in either event john hancock makes a onetime deduction from the amount applied as compensation for making the additional guarantee the current charge is   of the amount applied this charge may be increased by john hancock but it will never exceed  of the amount applied when a premium recalculation is effected on policy on a modified schedule and the new basic premium is less than the basic premium on the level schedule for the insureds age at issue of the policy a onetime deduction is made from the amount applied as compensation for the additional guarantee the current charge is   of the amount applied to reduce the new basic premium to an amount below the basic premium on the level schedule for the insureds age at issue this charge may be increased by john hancock but it will never exceed  of the amount applied charge for mortality and expense risks a daily charge is made for mortality and expense risks assumed by john hancock at an effective annual rate of  of the value of the accounts assets attributable to the policies this charge begins when amounts under a policy are first allocated to the account the mortality risk assumed is that insureds may live for a shorter period of time than estimated and therefore a greater amount of death benefits than expected will be payable in relation to the amount of premiums received the expense risk assumed is that expenses incurred in issuing and administering the policies will be greater than estimated john hancock will realize a gain from this charge to the extent it is not needed to provide for benefits and expenses under the policies charges for extra mortality risks an insured who does not qualify for either the preferred or standard underwriting class must pay an additional required premium because of the extra mortality risk this additional premium is collected in two ways up to   of the additional premiums deducted from premiums when paid and   of the additional premium is deducted monthly from account value in equal installments an insured who is charged an additional required premium because of the extra mortality risk may not be eligible to exercise the extra death benefit value option charges for additional insurance benefits an additional required premium must be paid if the owner elects to purchase an additional insurance benefit this additional premium is collected in two ways up to   of the additional premium is deducted from premiums when paid and   of the additional premium is deducted monthly from account value in equal installments charges for taxes currently no charge is made against account value for john hancocks federal income taxes but if john hancock incurs or expects to incur income taxes attributable to the account or this class of policies in future years it reserves the right to make a charge and any charge would effect what the subaccounts earn charges for other taxes if any attributable to the subaccounts may also be made charge for partial withdrawal on or after the fifth policy anniversary the owner may withdraw all or part of any excess value in the policy the amount to be withdrawn must be at least  an administrative charge equal to the lesser of  or  of the amount withdrawn will be deducted from the account value on the date of withdrawal guarantee of premiums and certain charges the policys basic premium is guaranteed not to increase except that a larger basic premium may result from the premium recalculation for a modified schedule policy  the state premium tax charge sales charges mortality and expense risk charge the charge for partial withdrawals and the issue charge are guaranteed not to increase over the life of the policy any charge for transfers among subaccounts the premium processing charge the maintenance charge the guaranteed death benefit charges and the insurance charge are guaranteed not to exceed the maximums set forth in the policy fund investment management fee the account purchases shares of the funds at net asset value a value which reflects the deduction from the assets of each fund of its investment management fee which is described briefly in the summary of this prospectus and of certain nonadvisory operating expenses for a full description of these deductions see the attached prospectuses for the funds distribution of policies applications are solicited by agents who are registered

investment manager and principal underwriter for john hancock variable series trust i  tax considerations policy proceeds although the policy contains provisions not found in fixed benefit life insurance policies john hancock believes the policy will nevertheless receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment section  of the internal revenue code code defines life insurance for federal tax purposes if certain standards are met at issue and over the life of the policy the policy will come within that definition john hancock will monitor compliance with these standards john hancock believes that the death benefit under the policy will be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code the owner of a policy is not deemed to be in constructive receipt of the cash values until a withdrawal or surrender a surrender partial surrender or withdrawal may have tax consequences for example the owner will be taxed on a surrender to the extent that the surrender value exceeds the net premiums paid under the policy ie ignoring premiums paid for optional benefits and riders but under certain circumstances the owner may be taxed on a withdrawal of policy values even if total withdrawals do not exceed total premiums paid john hancock also believes that except as noted below loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner distributions under policies entered into after june   on which premiums greater than the pay limit have been paid will be subject to taxation based on recent federal tax legislation the owner of such a policy will be taxed on distributions such as loans surrenders partial surrenders and withdrawals to the extent of any income gain to the owner incomefirst basis additionally a  penalty tax may be imposed on income distributed before the owner attains age   policies entered into prior to june   may also be subject to a tax on distributions if there is a material change in the benefits or other terms of the policy all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer or affiliates to the owner during any calendar year generally will be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying these rules your tax advisor should be consulted if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the recent tax law on your policy federal estate and state and local estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary the above description of federal tax consequences is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice for further information consult a qualified tax advisor federal and state tax laws can change from time to time and as a result the tax consequences to the owner and beneficiary may be altered charge for john hancocks taxes currently john hancock makes no charge against the account for federal income taxes that may be attributable to this class of policies if john hancock incurs or expects to incur income taxes attributable to this class of policies or any subaccount in the future it reserves the right to make a charge for those taxes under current laws john hancock may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws charges for such taxes may be made  corporate and hr  plans the policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section  of the code if so the code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance benefits thereunder should be

disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments whether or not recognized in the statement of financial position for which it is practicable to estimate the value in situations where quoted market prices are not available fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques sfas no  excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements therefore the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the company the methods and assumptions utilized by the company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments are as follows the carrying amounts reported in the statement of financial position for cash and temporary cash investments approximate their fair values fair values for public bonds are obtained from an independent pricing service fair values for private placement securities and publicly traded bonds not provided by the independent pricing service are estimated by the company by discounting expected future cash flows using current market rates applicable to the yield credit quality and maturity of the investments the fair values for common and preferred stocks other than subsidiary investments which are carried at equity values are based on quoted market prices the fair value for mortgage loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates adjusted to reflect the credit characteristics of the underlying loans mortgage loans with similar  john hancock mutual life insurance company notes to financial statementscontinued note nature of operations and significant accounting practicescontinued characteristics and credit risks are aggregated into qualitative categories for purposes of the fair value calculations the carrying amounts in the statement of financial position for policy loans approximates their fair value the fair value of interest rate swaps and currency rate swaps is estimated using a discounted cash flow method adjusted for the difference between the rate of the existing swap and the current swap market rate discounted cash flows in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars using current exchange rates the fair value for outstanding commitments to purchase longterm bonds and issue real estate mortgages is estimated using a discounted cash flow method incorporating adjustments for the difference in the level of interest rates between the dates the commitments were made and december   the fair value for commitments to purchase real estate approximates the amount of the initial commitment fair values for the companys guaranteed investment contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations based on interest rates currently being offered for similar contracts with maturities consistent with those remaining for the contracts being valued the fair value for fixedrate deferred annuities is the cash surrender value which represents the account value less applicable surrender charges fair values for immediate annuities without life contingencies and supplementary contracts without life contingencies are estimated based on discounted cash flow calculations using current market rates capital gains and losses realized capital gains and losses net of taxes and amounts transferred to the imr are included in net income unrealized gains and losses which consist of market value and book value adjustments are shown as adjustments to policyholders contingency reserves interest rate and currency rate swap contracts and

thereafter changed by the owner in accordance with the terms of the policy if the insured dies and there is no surviving beneficiary the owner will be the beneficiary but if the insured was the owner the owners estate will be the beneficiary assignment the owners interest in the policy may be assigned without the consent of any revocable beneficiary john hancock will not be on notice of any assignment unless it is in writing and until a duplicate of the original assignment has been filed at john hancocks home office john hancock assumes no responsibility for the validity or sufficiency of any assignment misstatement of age or sex if the age or sex of the insured has been misstated john hancock will adjust the benefits payable to reflect the correct age or sex  suicide if the insured commits suicide within  years from the issue date shown in the policy john hancock will pay in place of all other benefits an amount equal to the premium paid less any indebtedness on the date of death and any withdrawals if the suicide is more than  years from the issue date but within  years of any increase in death benefit due to payment of any premium in excess of the required premium the

seven days after receipt at john hancocks home office of all documents required for any such payment approximately twothirds of the claims for death proceeds which are made within two years after the date of issue of the policy will be investigated to determine whether the claim should be contested and payment of these claims will therefore be delayed john hancock may defer any transaction requiring a determination of account value for any period during which  the disposal or valuation of the accounts assets is not reasonably practicable because the new york stock exchange is closed or conditions are such that under the commissions rules and regulations trading is restricted or an emergency is deemed to exist or  the commission by order permits postponement of such actions for the

benefit and surrender value of the policy disregarding any policy loans each table separately illustrates the operation of a policy for an identified issue age premium schedule and sum insured at issue and shows how the death benefit and surrender value reflecting the deduction of the surrender charge if any may vary over an extended period of time assuming hypothetical rates of investment return ie investment income and capital gains and losses realized or unrealized equivalent to constant gross annual rates of   and  the tables are based on given annual premiums paid at the beginning of each policy year and will assist in a comparison of the death benefit and surrender value figures set forth in the tables with those under other variable life insurance policies which may be issued by john hancock or other companies the death benefit and surrender value for a policy would be different from those shown if premiums are paid in different amounts or at different times or if the actual gross rates of investment return average   or  over a period of years but nevertheless fluctuated above or below the average for individual policy years the amounts shown for the death benefit and surrender value are as of the end of each policy year the tables headed using current charges assume that the current rates for insurance and charges for expenses will be made in each year illustrated the tables headed using maximum charges assume that the maximum guaranteed charge will be made for insurance and for expense charges in each year illustrated the amounts shown in all tables reflect an average asset charge for the daily investment advisory expense charges to the portfolios of the fund equivalent to an effective annual rate of  and an assumed average asset charge for the annual nonadvisory operating expenses of each portfolio of the fund equivalent to an effective annual rate of  for a description of expenses charged to the portfolios including the reimbursement of any portfolio for annual nonadvisory operating expenses in excess of an effective annual rate of  a continuing obligation of the funds investment adviser see the attached prospectus for the fund the charges for the daily investment management fee and the annual nonadvisory operating expenses are based on the hypothetical assumption that policy values are allocated equally among the nine variable subaccounts the actual charges and expenses associated with any policy and will vary depending upon the actual allocation of policy values among subaccounts during the first  policy years the surrender values for the base policy are the account values less the contingent deferred sales charge and during the first four years less any unpaid issue charge thereafter the account value will be equal to the surrender value the tables reflect that no charge is currently made to the accounts for federal income taxes however john hancock reserves the right to make such a charge in the future and any charge would require higher rates of investment return in order to produce the same policy values the second column of each table shows the amount to which the total premiums paid to the end of a policy year during the premium paying period would accumulate if an amount equal to those premiums were invested to earn interest after taxes at  compounded annually the amounts shown for the death benefit and surrender value reflect excess value if any applied under the accumulate option john hancock will furnish upon request a comparable illustration reflecting the proposed

income taxation of cash withdrawn from certain affected life insurance policies called modified endowment contracts or mecs due to the amount of premium you plan to pay into this policy you will be affected by this law it is important for you to understand that all distributions made from your policy as applied for including policy loans withdrawals partial surrenders and certain dividends will be considered to be a distribution of any gain this means that if your policy is in a gain position when the withdrawal is made ie the value of your policy exceeds the amount youve paid into it you will owe ordinary income tax on the amount you withdraw in addition a  penalty tax is imposed by the irs on any taxable distribution made prior to age   except on disability or if taken in the form of an annuity the insurance proceeds payable to your beneficiary upon the death of the proposed insured will continue to be income tax free under current legislation this notice is designed to inform you of the income taxation of life insurance based upon our understanding of the information currently available it is not intended to provide you with legal advice which neither john hancock nor its

effecting conversion to fixed benefit policies pursuant to rule eb  v b set forth below is the information called for under rule eb  ii and rule eb  v b under the investment company act   act regarding certain procedures under john hancock mutual life insurance companys jhmlico and john hancock variable life insurance companys jhvlico scheduled premium variable life insurance policies hereinafter referred to individually as the policy and collectively as the policies rule eb  ii provides an exemption for a variable life insurance separate account its sponsoring insurance company its investment adviser and its principal underwriter from sections d e and c  of the  act and rule c thereunder for issuance transfer and redemption procedures under a variable life insurance policy to the extent necessary to assure compliance with rule e state insurance law or established administrative procedures of the life insurance company the rule requires as a condition for exemption that such procedures be reasonable fair and nondiscriminatory and be disclosed in the registration statement filed with respect to such variable life insurance policies jhmlico and jhvlico represent that their procedures meet the foregoing standards of rule eb  ii based on the following facts and circumstances  because of the insurance nature of the policies and in certain instances as a result of the requirements of the state insurance laws the procedures necessarily differ in significant respects from the procedures for mutual funds and contractual plans for which the  act was designed   many of the procedures have been adapted from those established and utilized in connection with the administration of jhmlicos fixed benefit life insurance policies and earlier versions of variable life insurance policies issued by its subsidiary jhvlico  certain procedures including the month conversion right to fixed benefit policies are required by rule e  jhmlico and jhvlico in structuring their procedures to comply with rule e state insurance laws and their established administrative procedures have attempted to meet the intent of the  act to the extent deemed feasible  generally speaking the state insurance laws to which both jhmlico and jhvlico are subject reflect the fundamental principle that the procedures shall not be unfair unreasonable or unjustly discriminatory to any policyholder  because of the intricate insurance methodology underlying the procedures it is often difficult to determine with certainty whether and to what extent a particular procedure or a given step to that procedure deviates from a specific requirement of section d e or c  of the  act or rule c thereunder accordingly the summary below includes the principal policy provisions and procedures that might be deemed to constitute either directly or indirectly accommodation of the  act requirements and insurance practices given the complexities of the policies operations the summary although comprehensive does not attempt to treat each and every mechanical variation or permutation that might occur and does not repeat every provision or procedure that is already set forth in the registration statement or exhibits thereto at the same time the summary in order to provide a comprehensive view of the procedures includes certain procedural steps that do not constitute a deviation from the sections and rule cited above rule eb  v b grants an exemption for a variable life insurance separate account its sponsoring insurance company its investment adviser and its principal underwriter from section d of the  act for variable life insurance policies which allow the policyholder to convert a variable life insurance policy into a fixed benefit life insurance policy at any time during the first  months after issuance the rule requires as a condition for exemption that the method of computing any adjustments made in payments or cash values to reflect variances between the payments and  cash values under the original policy and new policy be set out in an exhibit to the registration statement filed with respect to the variable life insurance policy jhmlicos and jhvlicos policies provide for such a conversion privilege no adjustments in payments and cash values are made upon exercise of that privilege as described below this memorandum divides the information called for by rules eb  ii and eb  v b into three parts the first part summarizes procedures under the policies which might be deemed to involve either directly or indirectly a redemption within the meaning of the  act the second part summarizes procedures which might be deemed to involve either directly or indirectly a purchase transaction the third part summarizes the procedures for converting a policy to a fixed benefit policy except as otherwise defined herein capitalized terms used in this memorandum have the same meaning as are defined in the prospectus contained in the applicable registration statement  if an owner requests a purchase or redemption transaction which is impossible for example allocation of a loan or partial surrender to subaccounts which have insufficient assets to support said allocation or impermissible such as a reduction in the basic death benefit below the minimum required amount jhmlico will notify the policy owner to determine what action if any the policy owner wishes to take instead this exhibit refers to procedures as they affect the respective variable accounts of jhmlico and jhvlico the account used in funding the policies except as otherwise stated herein these procedures do not necessarily reflect the fixed account under the policies which is held in the general account of each insurer whenever reference is made herein to jhmlico it should also be read as jhvlico insofar as jhvlico and its account are concerned each insurer having adopted identical procedures  i redemption procedures surrender and related transactions jhmlicos policies provide for the payment of monies to a policyholder owner or beneficiary upon presentation to jhmlico of a policy such presentation might be deemed to constitute either directly or indirectly a redemption of the owners interest within the meaning of the  act set forth below is a summary of the principal policy provisions and procedures which might be viewed as involving such a redemption the principal difference between such redemptions and redemptions it the mutual fund or contractual plan context is that under the policies the payee may be deemed not to receive a pro rata or proportionate share of the assets in jhmlicos account within the meaning of the  act the amount received by the payee will depend upon the particular benefit for which the policy is presented including for example the surrender value or death benefit there are also certain policy provisions  such as options on lapse   under which the policy will not be presented to jhmlico but which will affect the owners benefits and involve a transfer of the assets supporting the policy reserve out of the account finally state insurance law may require that certain requirements be met before jhmlico is permitted to make payments to the payee a surrender values if the insured party under a policy insured is alive jhmlico will pay within seven days the surrender value next computed after receipt at its home office of the policy and a signed request for surrender computations with respect to the investment experience of the subaccounts will be made as of  pm new york city time on each day during which the new york stock exchange is open for trading and on which the fund values its shares this will enable jhmlico to pay the surrender value based on the next computed value after a request is received while no premium is in default the surrender value is equal to the account value less any indebtedness less any contingent deferred sales charges and less any administrative surrender charge in general the account value for any day equals the policy account value for the previous day increased by any net premium and decreased by any charges against the account value accumulated at the subaccounts rate of return after charges against the account the contingent deferred sales charge is deducted from the policy account value upon surrender of the policy during the first thirteen policy years after issue it is deducted for fewer than thirteen years at certain issue ages the amount of this charge is calculated on the basis of the premium under the modified schedule for the issue age of the policy lower percentages apply at higher issue ages the total charge for sales load including the contingent deferred sales charge over the lesser of  years or the life expectancy of the insured will not exceed  of the basic premium at issue over that period no minimum amount of policy account value is guaranteed jhmlico will make the payment of the surrender value out of its general account and  transfer assets from the account to the general account for the amounts held for the policy in the account the administrative surrender charge is deducted from a policys account value upon its surrender or lapse in the first nine policy years after issue the amount of this charge is determined as an amount per thousand of guaranteed death benefit currently the charge is waived for a policy with more than  of guaranteed death benefit at the time of surrender or lapse and is reduced for all other policies in lieu of payment of the surrender value upon surrender of a policy in a single sum an election may be made to apply all or a portion of the proceeds under one of the benefit settlement options described in the policy or with the approval of jhmlico under other optional methods of settlement available from jhmlico the election may be made by the owner during the insureds lifetime or if no election is in effect at death by the beneficiary the benefit settlement options are subject to the restrictions and limitations set forth in the policy b partial surrender a policy may be partially surrendered in accordance with rule eb  ii the policy after the partial surrender must have aninitial sum insured at least as great as the minimum issue size for that type or policy when a policy is partially surrendered there is a proportionate reduction in death benefit account value surrender value contingent deferred sales charge administrative surrender charge required premium target loans riderrating premium and basic premium if there is an outstanding policy loan on the policy the outstanding indebtedness after the partial surrender can not exceed the then current available loan value partial surrenders will be effected as of the end of the valuation period in which all materials necessary to complete the partial surrender including a written request in proper form and the policy are received at jhmlicos home office similar to the surrender transaction jhmlico will pay within seven days the resulting surrender value computed  c death claims jhmlico will pay a death benefit to the beneficiary within seven days after receipt at its home office of due proof of death of the insured and all other requirements necessary  to make payment provided the policy is in full force  the death benefit will be the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit and excess value if any under the variable death benefit option plus all premiums received after the last processing date prior to the insureds date of death less any indebtedness on the date of death and  the account value at the end of the valuation period in which death occurs multiplied by the applicable death benefit factor or corridor factor as applicable less any indebtedness on the date of death the death benefit is also less any premium in default if death occurs during the  day grace period the guaranteed death benefit is equal to the basic death benefit the proceeds payable on death also reflect interest from the date of death to the date of payment jhmlico will make payment of the death benefit out of its general account and will transfer assets from the account to the general account in an amount equal to the amount held in the account for the policy terminated by death the excess of the guaranteed death benefit over the current death benefit if any will be paid out of a general account reserve maintained for that purpose in lieu of payment of the death benefit in a single sum a settlement option may be selected as described in section ia above state insurance laws impose various requirements such as receipt of a tax waiver before payment of the death benefit may be made in addition payment of the death benefit is subject to the provisions of the policy regarding suicide and incontestability in full force means that the insurance under the policy is being continued for the greater of the guaranteed death benefit and the current death benefit and that no unpaid premium is more than  days overdue  d default and options on lapse on each applicable processing date jhmlico compares the cumulative premium balance under a policy on the immediately preceding valuation date with the required premium target on such valuation date if the cumulative premium balance is then less than the required premium target for the policy the policy can be in default on that processing date the premium requirement will also be deemed satisfied on the last valuation date of any policy month if adequate excess value defined below is available on the scheduled due date if both of the tests fail the policy is in default the difference between the cumulative premium balance and the required premium target is the amount in default the policy provides that any amount in default may be paid within a day grace period after the date of default written notice will be furnished to the owner at his or her last known address at least  days prior to the end of the grace period specifying the minimum amount which must be paid to continue the policy in force on a premium paying basis after the end of the grace period if a payment at least equal to the amount in default is not received by the end of the grace period the policy will lapse if payment by the owner of an amount in default is received prior to the end of the grace period the policy will no longer be in default the portion of the payment equal to the amount in default will be processed as if it had been received on the processing date of the cumulative premium test any excess payment will be processed as of the date of receipt the insurance continues in full force during the grace period but if the insured dies during the grace period the amount in default will be deducted from the amount of death benefit otherwise payable if a policy lapses the surrender value under the policy on the date of lapse is applied under one of the following options for continued insurance not requiring further payment of premiums these options provide for variable or fixed paidup insurance or fixed extended term insurance on the life of the insured commencing on the date of lapse both the variable and fixed paidup insurance options provide an amount of paidup whole life insurance determined in accordance with the policy which the surrender value will purchase the amount of variable paidup insurance may then increase or decrease subject to any guarantee in accordance with the investment experience of the subaccount the fixed extended term insurance option provides a fixed amount of insurance determined in accordance with the policy with the insurance coverage continuing for as long a period as the available policy values will purchase if no option has been elected before the end of the grace period the fixed extended term insurance option automatically applies unless the amount of fixed paidup insurance would equal or exceed the amount of fixed extended term insurance or unless the insured is a substandard risk in either of which cases fixed paidup insurance is provided  the variable paidup insurance option is not available unless the initial amount of variable paidup insurance is at least  a policy continued under any option may be surrendered for its surrender value while the insured is living loans may be available under the variable and fixed paidup insurance options e policy loan loans may be made at any time a loan value is available after the first policy year the owner may borrow money on completion of a form satisfactory to jhmlico assigning the policy as the only security for the loan payment of the loan will be made from jhmlicos home office the loan value will be  of the surrender value in policy years two and three and  of the surrender value in later policy years interest accrues and is compounded daily at an effective annual rate determined by john hancock at the start of each policy year this interest rate will not exceed the greater of  the published monthly average defined below for the calendar month ending  months before the calendar month of the policy anniversary or  the published monthly average means moodys corporate bond yield averagemonthly average corporate as published by moodys investors service inc or if the average is no longer published a substantially similar average established by the insurance regulator where the policy is issued the amount of any outstanding loan plus accrued interest is called the indebtedness except when used to pay premiums a loan will not be permitted unless its is at least  the owner may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness while the insured is living and premiums are being duly paid when a loan is made shares are redeemed in an aggregate equal to the amount of the loan and this aggregate value is allocated to the loan account the shares redeemed will be redeemed in each subaccount in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among the subaccounts upon each loan repayment the same proportionate amount of the entire loan as was borrowed from the fixed account will be repaid to the fixed account the remainder of the loan repayment will be allocated to the appropriate subaccounts as stipulated in the current investment rule loan interest which is not paid by a policy anniversary will be added to the loan principal by automatically effecting an additional policy loan amounts transferred to the policy loan account are credited with interest at  less than the loan interest rate per annum for the first  policy years and  less than the loan interest rate per annum in years  and beyond which interest is transferred to the subaccount when the loan is repaid according to the investment rule then in affect a loan does not directly affect the amount of the required premium while the indebtedness is outstanding that portion of the account value that is in the loan account is credited with interest at a rate of  less than the loan rate for the first  policy years and  less than the loan rate in years  and later a rate which will usually be different  than the net return for the subaccounts since the loan account and the remaining portion of the account value will generally have different rates of investment return any death benefit above the guaranteed death benefit the account value and the surrender value are permanently affected by any indebtedness whether or not repaid in whole or in part the amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the indebtedness equals or exceeds the surrender value the policy terminates  days after notice has been mailed by jhmlico to the owner and any assignee of record at their last known addresses unless a repayment of the excess indebtedness is made within that period f transfers among variable subaccounts the owner may reallocate the amounts held for the policy in the variable subaccounts in each policy year without charge the owner may use either percentages in whole numbers or designate the dollar amount of funds to be transferred between subaccounts the reallocation must be such that the total in the subaccounts after reallocation equals  the change will be effective at the end of the valuation period in which jhmlico receives at its home office notice satisfactory to jhmlico g conversion privilege the conversion privilege provided in a accordance with rule eb  v b under the  act is discussed under iii below h partial withdrawal of excess value an owner may withdraw excess value from the policy on or after the first policy anniversary this privilege which reduces the account value by the amount of the withdrawal and the associated charge may be exercised only once in a policy year and will be effective as of the end of the valuation period in which jhmlico receives written notice satisfactory to it at its home office the minimum amount that may be withdrawn is  unless the current death benefit exceeds the guaranteed death benefit a partial withdrawal will not affect the death benefit payable an amount equal to  is charged against account value for each partial withdrawal when a withdrawal of excess value is made the premium component if any is treated as having been withdrawn first amounts withdrawn from the premium component reduce the cumulative premium balance ii purchase and related transactions set out below is a summary of the principal provisions of the policies and administrative procedures thereunder that might be deemed to constitute either directly or indirectly a purchase transaction within the meaning of the  act the summary shows that because of the insurance nature of the policies the procedures involved necessarily differ in certain significant respects form the purchase procedures for mutual funds and contractual plans the chief differences  revolve around the premium rate structure and the insurance underwriting ie evaluation of risk process there are also certain policy provisions  such as reinstatement  which do not result in the issuance of a policy but which required certain payments by the owner and involve a transfer of assets supporting the policy reserve into the account a premium schedules and underwriting standards premiums for jhmlicos policies will not be the same for all owners the chief reason is that the principle of pooling and distribution of mortality risks is based upon the assumption that each owner pays a premium commensurate with the insureds mortality risk which is actuarially determined based upon factors such as age sex smoking status health and occupation in the context of life insurance as contrasted with mutual funds a uniform premium or public offering price for all insureds would discriminate unfairly in favor of those insureds representing greater mortality risks to the disadvantage of those representing lesser risks accordingly although there will be no uniform public offering price for all insureds there will be a single price for all insureds in a given actuarial category the policies will be offered and sold pursuant to established premium schedules  and underwriting standards and in accordance with state insurance laws such laws prohibit unfair discrimination among policyholders but recognize that premiums may be based upon factors such as age sex smoking status health and occupation in a few states the premiums and values under the policies will not directly reflect the sex of the insured in accordance with industry practice jhmlico will establish procedures to handle errors in initial and subsequent premium payments to collect underpayments except for de minimis amounts  b application and initial premium processing upon receipt of a completed application from a proposed owner jhmlico will follow certain insurance underwriting ie evaluation of risk procedures designed to determine whether the proposed insured is insurable this process may involve such verification procedures as medical examinations and may require that further information be provided by the proposed insured before a determination can be made a policy cannot be issued ie physically issued through jhmlicos computerized issue system until this underwriting procedure has been completed the date on which a policy is issued is referred to as the date of issue the date of issue coincides with the beginning of a valuation period it represents the commencement of the suicide and contestable periods for purposes of the policies it is also the date as of which the insurance age of the proposed insured is determined it represents the first day of the policy year and therefore determines the policy anniversary it also marks the commencement of the variability of benefits these processing procedures are designed to provide immediate benefits to the proposed owner in connection with payment of the initial premium and will not dilute any benefit payable to an existing owner although a policy cannot be issued until after the underwriting process has been completed the proposed insured will receive immediate insurance coverage if he has paid his minimum first premium subject to the other terms and conditions of jhmlicos receipt and conditional temporary insurance agreement if the minimum first premium is paid with the application and the policy is issued as applied for the date of issue in general will be the last of the part a date or the part b date of the application or the date of most recent evidence of insurability so that variability of benefits will commence as of that date if the minimum first premium is not paid with the application the date of issue will be the actual date the application is processed for issue or the next valid issue date provided the owner pays the necessary premium except as referred to above no coverage will take effect with respect to a policy until the minimum first premium has been paid and the policy is delivered to the owner while the insured is living and has not consulted been examined or treated by a doctor since the latest part b of the application was completed if coverage under a policy never goes into effect any premium paid will be returned without interest jhmlico will require that the policy be delivered and the minimum initial premium paid within a specific period to protect itself against antiselection by the proposed owner resulting from deterioration in the insureds health generally the period will not exceed  days from the date of completion of the latest of parts a and b of the application and any required medical examination jhmlico will transfer the appropriate amount from its general account to the account on the date the policy is approved the appropriate amount will be calculated as though the net premium had in fact been transferred from the general account to the account commencing on the date the policy is issued  c premium recalculation the premium recalculation applicable to any policy on a modified schedule may be elected by the owner at any time up to the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday or if later the tenth policy anniversary if elected the premium recalculation will be effected on the policy anniversary next following receipt by jhmlico at its home office of satisfactory written notice if not elected sooner the premium recalculation will be effected by jhmlico on the policy anniversary nearest the insureds th birthday or if later the tenth policy anniversary the new basic premium resulting from a premium recalculation may be less than equal to or greater than the original basic premium but it will never exceed the guaranteed maximum recalculation premium for the attained age shown in the policy the new basic premium depends on the insureds sex smoking status and age the guaranteed death benefit under the policy and the account value on the valuation date immediately preceding the date of the premium recalculation d reinstatement provision the policy may be reinstated within  years after the beginning of the grace period unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted or the period of any extended term insurance has expired a policy will be reinstated upon receipt by jhmlico of a written application for reinstatement and production of evidence of insurability satisfactory to jhmlico and payment of an amount equal to the sum of a and b each accumulated at an effective annual rate of  to the date of reinstatement where a is the difference between the required premium target and the cumulative premium balance at the date of lapse and b is all required annual premiums for the period between the date of lapse and the date of reinstatement on the date of reinstatement the policy will have i a sum insured as if no lapse had occurred and ii indebtedness equal to any indebtedness at the end of the day immediately preceding the date of reinstatement the account value on the date of reinstatement will be the sum of a through c less d through f where a is the surrender value of the nonforfeiture option in effect on the date of reinstatement plus any indebtedness on the date of reinstatement b is the amount in premium payment above c is the deferred sales charge and administrative surrender charge adjustment as defined below d is the aggregate premium expense charges ie sales charge premium tax charge and federal dac tax charge and  e is the sum of all maintenance charges and charges for riders and ratings if any that would have been made from the date of lapse to the date of reinstatement if the policy had not lapsed with interest an effective annual rate of  to the date of reinstatement the deferred sales charge adjustment is the smaller of a and b where a is the deferred sales charge and administrative surrender charge applicable if the policy were surrendered immediately after reinstatement and b is the deferred sales charge and administrative surrender charge made on the date of lapse in order to assist a lapsed owner in making a considered judgment as to whether to reinstate jhmlico may calculate the amount payable upon reinstatement and freeze the amount for up to ten days f repayment of loan the owner may repay all or a portion of any indebtedness while the insured is living and premiums are duly paid when a loan is made shares are redeemed in an aggregate value equal to the amount of the loan and this aggregate value is transferred to the general account and carried as a loan account the shares redeemed will be redeemed in each subaccount in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among the subaccounts upon each loan repayment the same proportionate amount of the entire loan as was borrowed from the fixed account will be repaid to the fixed account the remainder of the loan repayment will be allocated to the appropriate subaccounts as stipulated in the current investment rule while the indebtedness is outstanding that portion of the account value that is in the loan account is credited with interest at a rate of at  less than the loan rate in the first  policy years and  less than the loan rate in years  and beyond a rate which will usually be different than the net return for the subaccounts since the loan account and the remaining portion of the account value will generally have different rates of investment return any death benefit above the guaranteed death benefit the account value and the surrender value are permanently affected by any indebtedness whether or not repaid in whole or in part the amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable g correction of misstatement of age or sex if jhmlico discovers that the age or sex of the insured has been misstated jhmlico will reconstruct the policy by determining what benefits the premium paid would have purchased at the correct age or sex special adjustments may have to be made if the resultant face amount is below jhmlicos minimum size policy  once the benefits are redetermined jhmlico will make the necessary adjustment in the reserve assets in the account to reflect the redetermined benefits and the correct age and sex of the insured iii conversion of policy jhmlicos policies in accordance with rule eb v b under the  act provide that the owner within  months of issue or any time after thereafter may transfer the entire account value under the policy to the fixed account thus creating a nonvariable or fixed benefit life insurance policy this conversion privilege is designed to permit an owner to change his or her mind and to obtain a fixed benefit policy fccdoc exhibit  john hancock variable annuity and variable life insurance accounts power of attorney the undersigned member of the board of
