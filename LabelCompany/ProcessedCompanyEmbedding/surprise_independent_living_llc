residential care homes offer a smaller more homelike family setting for seniors care homes offer food services and assistance with daily living but do not typically have a medical professional onsite limited parttime medical care is offered but its not a primary focus of this type of senior living community care home residences are typically located in traditional homes and neighborhoods and provide care for fewer patients than assisted living communities it is uncommon for a care home to offer services for more than  seniors which helps create the more personal homestyle living environment cost of care homes living in a residential care home is often half the cost of nursing home care and in some states it is even more affordable than assisted living care however cost can vary depending on the geographical location of the residential care home as well as the types of services needed in home care can cost anywhere from  a month to  each month and dementia care can cost even more   cost can also vary depending on room privacy according to genworthcom a residential care home typically runs  a month for a shared bedroom and  a month for a private bedroom most residential care homes have private rooms available for their residents as well as shared rooms  services offered in residential care homes residential care homes offer supervised care meals activities and health management while assisted living communities may offer extensive activities such as senior aerobics and field trips a care home is a better fit for someone who needs more
