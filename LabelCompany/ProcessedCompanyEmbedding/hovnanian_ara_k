markets housing market us economyhomebuilder stocks housing bubble hovnanian new home salesadmin as we discussed on our first quarter conference call we expected our second quarter gross margin to be adversely affected by incentives and concessions on started unsold homes however the impact was greater than we anticipated and we are disappointed with our second quarter results  – ara k hovnanian chairman of the board president and chief executive officer  hov nd qtr k there’s a reason ara hovnanian dumped  shares of hov stock on april th  – insider stock selling ahead of an earnings disaster hovnanian greeted the stock market this morning with a big earnings miss  it’s stock plunged as much as  i may have been a bit early in forecasting my demise of the housing market but i know i’m right  hov is the th largest homebuilder in the country  it sells homes in  states including the largest housing markets for new homes like california texas and florida   hov primarily sells into the firsttime and moveup buyer market  in other words it’s q results are a good barometer of the market for new home sales in general although it’s revenues were higher thanks to the bubble in new home prices hov’s gross margins plunged  basis points from  last year in q to  in its latest quarter this is due to the expense associated with started but unsold homes a feature that is endemic to every homebuilder i research  it’s total unit home deliveries dropped  vs the q  it’s cost of sales also includes over  million inventory and land option writeoffs vs k in q  while not large relative to its total cost of sales inventory and land writeoffs are going to become a recurring feature with every homebuilder going forward despite a decline in home deliveries hov ballooned its inventory by  million in the last six months  billion in oct  vs  billion at the end of the most recent quarter inventories at all of the homebuilders have swelled up to record levels – even highher than at the peak of the big housing bubble this is despite the fact that unit sales volume is roughly  of peak unit sales volume an even more shocking fact is that the amount of debt per housing unit sold at every homebuilder is several times higher than it was at the peak of the housing bubble for instance at  billion hov’s debt load has increased  million in the last six months on a trailing  month basis hov has delivered  homes this translates into  of debt per home unit delivered i have always predicted that hov would be the first homebuilder to hit the wall  this is why i have not published a research report on the company it’s stock has been below  since late  it’s not worth shorting however i have published indepth research reports on the two stocks that i think are most likely to follow hov into the bankruptcy abyss  both of these companies have operating and financial profiles which are quite similar to that of hov  both of these stocks plunged and then rebounded about six months ago  i believe that we will see them plunge and stay down at some point in the next  months  the problem is you have to positioned ahead of the plunge or you will miss it you can access the report for either company here   i will have more on this later but now the legacy home equity loans left over from the big housing bubble are going to start torpedoing the financial system no one has thought about these roadside financial exploding devices but starting in mid and ballooning up quickly from there home equity loans sitting dormant other than a small monthly interest payment have been and will be converting to fixedrate amortizing nd mortgages the monthly payment on these will double or triple for most homeowners with helocs resetting the amount sitting on bank balance sheets is over a half trillion dollars for its quarter ended march  the delinquency rate on its heloc balances jumped  just when mom and pop home flippers were thinking that the water was nice and warm they are going to get ripped apart by a new wave of distressed home sellers and foreclosure auctions for the record i search for home listings on just one zip code in central denver i am now getting at least one “new price” email per day including three yesterday and one today already the next leg down in the housing market is starting… share thistweet related  thoughts on “hovnanian ushers in the next housing market collapse” this is merely my own observation so take it as that but in the local toronto newspapers there seems to be an awful lot of ads lately telling the common man how huge profits can be easily made in real estate flipping essentially looks fishy to me is that some kind of warning that the next leg is down not just in the us but also in canada reply yes in fact i just realized yesterday that i have not heard any ads for home flipping seminars on the main denver sports radio station in a few weeks like from feb thru midmay i heard the ads every hour i have not heard any for at least  weeks it coincides with the sudden spike in listings i’ve been seeing reply so dave when would be the best time to buy if you’re in the market for a new home i’m wanting to relocate from florida to colorado and am faced with both a collapsing housing market and an imminent fed rate increase do the two interrelate at all also does the housing market translate to the land for sale market i’m actually more interested in land to build a house on than an actual existing house thanks in advance for any replies you have the time to make and a lotta’ thanks for the time you take to keep us informed take care reply wait for the market to crash you can find awesome apt rental deals all around denver right now and it’s only going to get better as more and more new buildings get finished reply chris i agree with dave i just finished an involved missive responding to you and it bombed ugh so here goes… anyway like you i have been investigating the idea of building – deal is land prices are through the roof out there – many anecdotes on this but i won’t belabor the point in my case after drawing a decent set of design drawings as i am architect – i sent them to a contractor referred to me out there in co and before a shovel was thrust in to the dirt i was into this for  to k – this just for dirt fees permits tap fees and purchase of dirt –  to  acres my pool of sites was limited as i don’t want sites without public utilities – septics propane wells etc not for me thank you also spoke with a planning guy in doug co when there in march of this year – asking about lower priced sites in and about doug co he said that the lower priced sites  ie an acre at say k as listed on corelogic or re colorado have many issues the least of which is that they are unbuildable due to lack of utilities in larkspur just south of castle rock there are these types of sites some in the midst of homes already built and roads with utilities outboard of the developed sites and after some due diligence and talking around i come to find that the ones that are in developed areas down there that are cheaper require major infrastructure work – ie lift stations and the like which the locals are not want to pour money into many of these infrastructure projects are at least  years out at the present time according to doug co in my talk with doug co i had heard of a guy from fl wanting to build – saw said sites on the web and bought sight unseen only to find that he can’t get water sewer etc to his site because of said infrastructure he is now out near k as there is a no recourse law in co on these sorts of purchases i find that amazing but apparently true if you are serious about building you have to see the dirt in my driving around many sites just cannot be excavated or built on and frankly i find it reprehensible that car would even allow a realtliar to list these things so do your due diligence before making any offers and having been in this process for a couple of years now it is really important that you do the work – no one else will do it for you good luck in your endevours reply so as not to clutter up this thread with offtopic conversation is there some way i can contact you email perhaps thanks for the info meanwhile reply investmentresearchdynamicsgmailcom reply you called it reply hi dave in case you have not seen this…httpwwwgataorgnode phil reply i had not seen that – thanks for bringing it to my attention reply i wonder why they would cover them now given the persistent rumors over the last few years about

chairman president and ceo larry sorsby executive vice president and cfo brad oconnor vice president chief accounting officer and controller and david bachstetter vice president finance and treasurer ill now turn the call over to ara ara go ahead ara k hovnanian thanks jeff i am going to review our operating results for the first quarter and discuss the current sales environment larry is going to follow up with a little more detail and discuss other items including our liquidity position our first quarter results were in line with our previous guidance and ill discuss that more fully in a moment however i thought a review our capital markets environment would be helpful since late in fiscal  the high yield market for our credit rating has been difficult we faced challenging high yield environments from time to time in our year history of participating in high yield markets similar to what weve seen in the past we expect the high yield markets to eventually reopen for us the overall high yield markets are clearly strengthening but as a result of the difficult high yield markets for us we had to temporarily reduced our land spend as we paid off  million of maturing public debt between october  and may of  additionally in the beginning of  we announced that we are existing four underperforming markets these two factors led to a reduction in our land position and a  decline in our total community count this clearly impacted a number of our operating results compared to last year but again we are in line with our previous guidance starting in the upper left hand corner of slide  we show there for the first quarter of  total revenues decreased slightly to  million from last year a portion of this decline is a shift in deliveries from whollyowned communities to joint venture communities we dont report joint venture revenues in our consolidated results if you include those revenues our total revenues would have been up  on a yearoveryear basis in the upper right hand portion of this slide you can see that our gross margin was  in the first quarter of  up from  in last years first quarter moving down to lower left hand corner you can see that we continue to improve our sga ratio during the first quarter of this year reducing it to  from  last year in the lower right hand corner of this slide we show that we had a pretax profit for the first quarter with only  but compared to a loss of  million in last years first quarter it was good and while the amount was small and it was helped with some debt bond repurchases that larry will explain more fully were pleased with the direction particularly given the drop in our community count that we previously discussed after taxes we had a small loss of  compared to last years loss in the first quarter of  million although our bottomline was much better obviously not where it needs to be and were very focused on further improving our operating results by replenishing our land supply improving our gross margins getting our new communities open into the market soon and continuing to reduce our debt and interest costs over the longerterm while our gross margin increased in the first quarter our gross margin is still below or  normalized level we achieved  margins as recently as fiscal  and  three factors continue to be a headwind for more meaningful gross margin improvements rising labor costs increased use of incentives in certain communities and higher land costs weve talked about these factors for a number of quarters weve continued to burn through the higher cost land we purchased in  and  when market conditions were more favorable the labor cost increases and a more aggressive competitive environment however continues to put pressure on our gross margin as well as the gross margin of the overall homebuilding industry slide  shows the trailing month gross margin for  of our peers plus our own  of the  homebuilders reported a yearoveryear decline in gross margin we suspect the same combination of factors i just discussed that are negatively impacting our margins also had adverse impact on our peers gross margin if you turn to slide  you can see the impact of exiting four markets reducing our land spend and paying off  million of maturing debt our consolidated community count decreased sequentially each quarter throughout fiscal  and into the first quarter of fiscal  since we announced the decision to exit four markets our community count in those markets is down from  at the end of last years first quarter to two communities at the end of this years first quarter that represents almost half of the yearoveryear decline in our total community count in light of the capital markets being unavailable to us last year we took appropriate steps to increase our liquidity so that were able to pay off a substantial amount of debt maturities however the resulting reduction in our community count makes a challenging  yearoveryear comparisons given a  decline in our community count its not surprising that we experienced an  decline in our first quarter net contracts after paying off debt maturities that i just described we ended the last year and began this year and quarter with  million of cash and liquidity this allowed us to invest a  million in land and land development in the first quarter our largest land spent in five quarters many of the new lots we are controlling are entitled but unimproved it takes more time to get those communities developed and open for sale compared to finished lots which were more available in the past therefore there will be some time lag before our community count begins to rebound but we do expect it to rebound on slide  we show that our consolidated contracts per community increased from  to  this quarter this obviously help mitigate some of the effect of the declining community count improvements in contracts per community like we had in the first quarter of  allows us to receive the benefit of those extra deliveries from existing communities without having to have much if any additional sga costs that certainly is a positive step toward improving both our operating efficiencies and profitability while our sales absorptions continued to increase we as well as the entire industry remain below historical normal sales pace per community slide  shows our consolidated contracts per community on a monthly basis here we show the most recent month in blue and the same month a year ago in gray for  of the past  months contracts per community were equal to or better than the same month of the prior year the spring selling season is officially underway our february results in contracts per community increased from  last year to  this year and indicate were off to a strong selling season as a matter of fact the  contracts per community in february was the highest contracts per community for any month in the past three years the early results are positive and based on the strong traffic levels were optimistic that the balance of the spring selling season will be strong on slide  we show on the left hand side the dollar amount of our contract backlog decrease to  billion from  billion despite the decline in community count our backlog is still respectable and positions us for solid results in future quarters ill now turn it over to larry sorsby our executive vice president and chief financial officer j larry sorsby thanks ara on slide  we provide an update on houston despite the fact that we have had over two years of significantly lower oil prices our houston operations continue to post solid results during the first quarter of  we saw the absolute number of net contracts in houston increased by  yearoveryear and net contracts per community increased  yearoveryear from  to  as i have said in prior calls there were three things that set our houston operations apart from many of the builders we compete against in that market number one we focus on a lower average price points our average home price on homes delivered for the first quarter of  in houston was approximate  which is even lower than it has been in recent quarters number two we do not build in any of the highly competitive master planned communities and number three we have less exposure to communities in the energy corridor in houston than our peers we commend our local houston management team that worked diligently to successfully – extremely difficult local market conditions despite continued success for our houston operations we will keep a close eye on the market and we are prepared to take appropriate action should circumstances change as a side note our texas operations both houston and dallas remain amongst our strongest markets turning to slide  you will see our owned and optioned land position broken out by a publicly reported market segments our investments and land option deposits was  million as of january   additionally we have another  million invested in three development expenses in november after improving our liquidity position we started more aggressively seeking land parcels again as a result we are now beginning to review a greater number of land deals at our corporate land committee and remain on reloading our land position as shown on slide  its a direct result of our increased land spend during the first quarter both our owned lots and unconsolidated joint ventures and our consolidated owned lots excluding mothballed lots increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of  to the first quarter of  the  million we spent on land and land development in the first quarter of  was more than we spent in any quarter last year furthermore it was more than last years average of  million of land and land development spend per quarter or  million we averaged in fiscal  a period of time when we did not have pressure from bond maturities looking at all of our consolidated communities in the aggregate including mothballed communities and the  million of inventory not owned we have an inventory book value of  billion net of  million of impairments one of our key operating metrics is return on investment on slide  we show trailing  months homebuilding ebit to inventor for us and our peers this roi metric measures pure operating performance before interest expense and compared to our peers we stack up well we and the entire industry are still not at normal roi levels yet but this will improve as we get further into the recovery we realize that even after paying off  million of debt maturities between october  and may  our leverage in interest expense levels remain high and we are committed to lowering both over time the combination of deleveraging along with the return to a more normalized ebit to inventory levels will improve our future pretax results dramatically one important component of return on investment is inventory turnover on slide  you can see that we have the second highest inventory turnovers over the trailing  months compared to our peers given our liquidity constraints achieving a high inventory turnover will continue to a focus for us going forward other area for discussion for the quarter is related to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed  million over deferred tax asset valuation allowance we should reverse the remaining valuation allowance when begins generating sustained profitability levels higher than recent years the end of the first quarter of fiscal  our valuation allowance in the aggregate was  million the remaining valuation allowance is a very significant asset not currently reflected our balance sheet and weve taken numerous steps to protect it we will not have to pay cash federal income taxes on approximately  billion of future pretax earnings on slide  we show that we ended the first quarter with the total shareholders deficit of  million if you add back the remaining valuation allowance as weve done on this slide then our shareholders equity would be a positive  million if you look at this on a per share basis its  per share which means at yesterdays closing stock price of  per share our stock price is trading at a  discount to our adjusted book value per share over time we believe that we can repair our balance sheet and have no current intentions of issuing equity anytime soon highlighted on slide  we continued to show improvement in some of our credit statistics on the left hand portion of the slide we show that our adjusted ebitda increased slightly during the first quarter to  million compared to  million in last years first quarter in the middle of the slide you can see our interest incurred declined by  to  million in the first quarter of  our interest incurred metric declined due to us paying off at maturity  million in debt between october  and may  this was partially offset by our increased use of land banks or previously owned land where the carry cost is recorded as interest as a reminder a typical land bank where we do not own the land prior to land banks purchase of the land accounts for the carry we pay as an increased land cost rather than interest and therefore hits gross margin rather than interest expense on the right hand side of the slide we show that our adjusted ebitda to interest incurred also increased to about  times compare to  times in last years first quarter despite the reduction in interest incurred our interest expense ratio was higher in the first quarter this year as compared to last year as shown on slide  the higher interest expense ratio in the first quarter  was primarily due to two reasons first there was  million of land and lot sales interest associated with the sale of a previously mothballed community in southern california and second we have  million reduction in our total revenues on slide  we show our maturity ladder our first significant maturities do not come due until january  we repurchased  million face amount of unsecured notes during the first quarter of fiscal  at a discount as a result we booked an  million gain on extinguishment of debt this was effectively an early retirement of  million of face value of our two different unsecured  bonds consisting of  million of our  notes due in  and  million of our  notes due in  as well as a  million of face value over december  exchangeable notes units although we can proactively review the capital markets for refinancing opportunities we are running the business as if we will have to pay off the  million notes due december  and the  million revolver due june  with cash while the high yield market continues to be challenging for us we have a strong relationships and continue to develop new relationships with alternative capital sources including land banking project specific nonrecourse debt joint ventures and model sale leaseback finance as we look beyond the earlier day of maturities we expect our operating performance and credit statistics to improve further and anticipate tapping the capital markets to refinance both are later dated   and  maturities as seen on slide  after using  million to repurchase debt and spending  million on land and land development in the first quarter we ended the first quarter with a liquidity position of  million which is within our liquidity target between  million and  million assuming no changes in market conditions and excluding the impact of land related charges and gains losses on extinguishment of debt as we said on our yearend conference call we continue to expect total deliveries including deliveries from unconsolidated joint ventures for fiscal  to be down approximately  compared to fiscal  total deliveries which also includes deliveries from unconsolidated joint ventures looking ahead to fiscal  we expect our total deliveries to grow again additionally we expect our gross margin for all of fiscal  to be similar to what it was for all of fiscal  and we expect to be able to keep our sga ratio around our normalized  level while we expect lower interest expense dollars in fiscal  because we anticipated a decline in consolidated revenue in  we do not expect to make progress in reducing our interest expense as a percentage of total revenues during this year however in  we will expect to see this ratio continue to improve again as it has been doing for the last five years we expect our consolidated revenues to be down in the second quarter of fiscal  compared to last years second quarter keep in mind that some of the communities that we transferred to an unconsolidated joint venture will be delivering homes had these remain consolidated deliveries the consolidated revenue decline would have been less further we expect our gross margin for the second quarter to be similar to the gross margin in the same quarter of the previous year we expect our sga ratio will improve in the second quarter compared to last year and that will offset some of the impact of the decline in our revenues the end result as we expect our pretax profits for the  second quarter to be similar to last years second quarter ill now turn it back to ara for brief concluding comments ara k hovnanian thanks larry after a deleveraging in fiscal  we are now focused on identifying new land parcels so that we can grow our deliveries in  and beyond as larry pointed out we made progress this quarter and we increased our owned lot position we are very focused on high inventory turnover to leverage our operating capability we began this year with about  million in excess cash and liquidity that we have since put to work both buying back some of our debt and through purchasing and optioning land for future community the faster we can get these new communities opened the faster we can get back to help your levels of profitability and its something we are very focused on we are confident that the steps we have taken are positioning us properly for the continued market recovery that concludes our formal remarks and wed like to turn it over for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instruction and our first question for today comes in the line of nishu sood for deutsche bank tim daley this is actually tim on for nishu thank you for taking my question my first question is actually regarding the gross margin you know solid progress yearoveryear you mentioned some headwinds and as well some tailwinds including the labor land incentives and as well as kind of working your way through some of the higher priced inventory or land that you purchased back in the minibubble i was just wondering could you walk us through each of these moving parts and as well what you expect for them next year ara k hovnanian yeah i cant say that we could be very specific because its so situational but overall as i think we pointed out that our guidance is that our full year gross margins will be similar thats in terms full year for  will be similar to last years full year j larry sorsby and clearly as time goes by there is less and less overhang from the lot that we purchased and what you referred to as the minibubble so that headwind should diminish in future years you know its hard to answer the labor question i think we as well as the entire industry have seen labor cost increases that have caused margin declines for an entire industry as we project forward we assume no changes in costs no changes in home prices no changes in absorption pace historically we and the industry have been able to offset any cost increases by raising home prices this particular cycle we have very unusual to see labor cost increases kind of outstrip our ability to raise prices hard to say what may or may not happen in the future tim daley and just a followup on that it seems just looking at the backlog on a whollyowned versus daily basis it seems that california is contributing a substantially higher amount while higher amount of deliveries in q than q  and now a higher amounts of backlog dollars as well is your california gross margin a bit higher than they are in the rest of the country as is the case with some other builders just trying to kind of figure out the mix shift there as the total buckets shrinks j larry sorsby as a general statement and highly regulated markets where you have expensive land we have a higher gross margin that we do in market to where were able to auction finish lots such as houston we get a higher inventory turn and houston kind of offsets slightly lower margins and in california we have to have higher margins to offset the lower inventory turns so i think as a generic comment the california gross margins are higher on average than many parts of our company operator thank you and our next question comes from line of ryan mckeveny from zelman industries ryan mckeveny one more on the gross margin specific to the q guidance i believe you said it will be similar to q of last year which on an adjusted excluding capitalized interest basis we see as  so when i think about that i guess first is that the right number that you are comparing to and then secondly regarding the q  results which were  implies to more around  bps of decline sequentially so just curious of the factors youve talked pressuring margins is there anything specific to call out on why that q would be down that amount relative to what you just reported for q j larry sorsby first of all the answer is yes  or  that you cited the right number comparing it to and the reason i think is just kind of mix where the deliveries are coming from across the country and community by community so thats a simple answer ryan mckeveny got it okay then one a bit random one here but we saw press release yesterday about a jv you guys have in saudi arabia and were just wondering if you could maybe elaborate a bit on the economics of that for the company and whether this is a type of growth opportunity potentially going forward thank you ara k hovnanian sure well first of all at the moment its a small joint venture that we actually established a few years ago its small amount of investment for us although we do have the option to increase our contribution the venture is with a large land owner there and frankly was random that the opportunity came about the announcement yesterday was that our venture signed a joint venture agreement with the saudi governments ministry of housing to provide housing that they are subsidizing for their citizens at this point i dont think its anything material but it does have the opportunity to become a little more meaningful and if it does become more meaningful well certainly report on that in a little more detail in the future j larry sorsby the joint venture that was announced yesterday is actually a joint venture between our saudi joint venture with this large land owner and the ministry of housing so its kind of a joint venture on a joint venture that has tremendous potential but only time will tell whether its realized operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of megan mcgrath from mkm partners megan mcgrath good morning i wanted to followup on some demand environment comments you talked about both a nice increase in absorptions in recent months but also an increase in incentives that were impacting your gross margin so i realized a lot of this is localized so maybe you could talk us through sort of big picture you know your sense on the demand environment and where you are seeing increased incentives and does that coincide with where you are seeing increased absorptions as well ara k hovnanian sure just overall the macro perspective we definitely are feeling a little strengthening in the marketplace and i think our sales per community our contracts per community are certainly an indication of that if i look around the country id say were feeling some strengthening certainly in northern california in the sacramento area that has been strong were continuing to see a strong texas market the arizona market in bromley in phoenix that has been strengthening as well on the other side were seeing a little more challenge in the chicago market which has historically done very well for us and our southeast coastal markets have had more of a headwind in terms of incentives that would include the hilton primarily the hilton head in savannah markets in south megan mcgrath okay great thats helpful and then to switch gears a little and talk about your increase land spend similarly can you give us any detail there on – was there any particular regions or product type where you saw yourself spending more money this quarter ara k hovnanian no i say nothing stick out of my mind i mean we shrunk the number of divisions by four as weve said during the call and our intent and plan is to be larger in the  plus markets that we are in and thats part of our strategy so our plan is to increase income spread that in many of our markets it just depends on where we find the best opportunities at any given moment i forgot to mention in the dc market by the way weve seen a little of strengthening in the virginia – northern virginia segment recently and perhaps that comes from peoples faith that the defense industry may see more dollar spent and that certainly helps employment in that area megan mcgrath great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sam mcgovern from credit suisse sam mcgovern hey guys thanks for taking my question just on the bond buybacks can you walk us through how you guys think about the irr on the bond repurchased versus using the cash to reinvest in the business for the next few years and also whether you guys have repurchased any bonds after quarter end j larry sorsby we typically bought bonds back when we thought we got a higher yield by buying bonds back than we could achieve by investing in a new deal where was the yield was equal to or higher than what or underwriting hurdle rates were for equal land deal you know in that particular quarter first quarter we obviously ended the fourth quarter with a lot of cash that we immediately put to use so it was even easier to make that decision the hurdle rates again remained higher than we were able to achieve on our typical land deals but we just couldnt put the money to work so the actual spread was even a greater spread because it was earning virtually nothing sitting in the bank but we know that debt is coming due in a couple of years anyway so it was something that we reflected on and thought was the best decision at this point in time and i dont believe there is an subsequent that will be announced in the q with respect to subsequent bond purchases sam mcgovern got it and what capacity do you guys have to repurchase bonds and what covenants are being used to repurchase the junior debt j larry sorsby i dont believe were currently restricted by covenants buying back bad debt so there are no financial covenants that that causes us to be restricted sam mcgovern okay great thanks ill pass it on operator thank you operator instruction our next question comes from the line of james finnerty from citi james finnerty hi good morning ara k hovnanian good morning james finnerty just going back to i think the prior commentary on  deliveries being similar to  i apologize if i missed that did you reiterate that today in terms of consolidated plus joint venture deliveries ara k hovnanian i dont believe we use those exact words i believe what we said was  tend to grow again including unconsolidated joint ventures james finnerty so grow again relative to  ara k hovnanian yes james finnerty okay and then in terms of  land spend you spent  in the first quarter can you give us any idea for the full year  versus   you spent i believe  million how should we think about that ara k hovnanian i think you should expect us to spend more on – in the aggregate in  that we did in  james finnerty okay great and then last just on the bond repurchases were those bonds retired ara k hovnanian yeah j larry sorsby yeah james finnerty okay great thank you operator thank you and that concludes our questionandanswer session for today i would like to turn the conference back over to ara hovnanian for any closing comments ara k hovnanian great thank you very much well continue to make progress as larry shared earlier from the pure operations standpoint which we measure by ebitda inventory we continue to perform very well compared to our peers but all of us are suffering from a challenging ebit inventory environment that will improve as it does every cycle weve certainly seen that over in the last  years of our history and when we combine that were getting our revenue growth back again as our new communities open were confident that we will see continued improving results over the long term thanks very much and well look forward to giving you more updates each quarter that are positive thank you operator thank you this concludes our conference call for today thank you all for
