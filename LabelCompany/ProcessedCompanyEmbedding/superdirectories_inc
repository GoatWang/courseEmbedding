q includes forwardlooking statements or opinions regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company and are subject to a number of risks and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in forwardlooking statements among such factors are general business and economic conditions and risk factors as listed in its annual report on form k or listed from time to time in documents filed by the company with the securities and exchange commission results of operations  q fy for the nine months ended june   we incurred a net operating loss of  as compared with a net operating loss of  for the comparable period last year our net operating losses consist primarily of ongoing costs of operating our website as well as legal and accounting fees incurred in connection with ongoing sec filing requirements and consulting services since inception we have not generated revenue we intend for our service directory to go live during the course of this fiscal year at which time we expect to begin generating revenue liquidity and capital resources  q fy our cash at june   was  our cash on hand is unlikely to be sufficient capital in and of itself to finance our bare administrative costs let alone our proposed operations during the next  months no assurance can be given that funding will be available to us on reasonable terms if at all net cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended june   was  compared with  for the same period last fiscal year the dropoff in the amount of cash used during the first nine months of this fiscal year as compared with last fiscal year is due primarily to the noncash derivative liability adjustments which mask the reductions in accounting and legal expense connected with being public offset by the value of shares issued in payment of various consulting services net cash used in operating activities from inception through june   was  net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended june   was  which is slightly higher than the figure for the same period last year of  due to repayment of loans to our sole officer and director luke lalonde totaling  repaid during the first nine months ended june   versus  repaid in the first nine months ended june   net cash provided by financing activities from inception through june   was  plan of operation  fy the following discussion of our plan of operation for the next  months and our discussion of our liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial data included in our previously filed annual report we are including this plan of operation in recognition of the fact that we are a development stage company and have yet to achieve operating revenues our plan of operation for the next twelve months is dependent upon our raising additional capital as of june   we only had  in cash available however we still believe we can satisfy our basic capital requirements for the fiscal year ending september   from cash on hand so long as we augment that with private placements of our common stock andor loans from management we have been successful in financing our operational and developmental activities to date by selling shares of our common stock and from advances from our president however we have no assurance that we will be able to continue in this way and our current available cash balance as of june   is insufficient to continue development and will require a significant stock offering andor continued advances from our president in order to have sufficient capital to continue development until income producing business operations are commenced we have no plans for other business activities if we are unable to raise required funds we believe we will need to raise additional capital of approximately  in order to continue operations for the fiscal year ending september   as well as fully implement our entire business and marketing strategy at all planned levels of activity our activities to date have been limited to building our database the information available through our directory comes from ever changing and growing sources we have recently experienced delays in meeting certain target dates related to our business operations the delays were principally caused by our need to synchronize the capabilities of our existing servers and to install fiber optic lines in our gatineau quebec facilities we believe that in the th quarter of  we will have a sufficient database to make our website marketable we currently have  directory editors who work on a contract basis research subjects for our directory create new categories and add websites to our directory our average cost per directory consultant is approximately  per month we are currently conducting a training program for our editors to help us to reach the desired efficiency of each editor being able to add approximately  new links per day into our database we currently have five servers in operation  two in watertown new york at facilities operated by westelcom two in gatineau quebec and one at facilities operated by mci in montreal we plan to install a sixth server at a westelcom facility in plattsburgh new york in the fall of  in  contingent on available funding we intend to start building an administrative staff that will be needed to manage our business as we prepare to move from a developmental to operational mode in this regard we plan to add approximately six administrative personnel and expect to begin to incur related payroll costs of approximately  per month by late  we anticipate that we will have sufficiently developed our database to the point where we can offer a product that will be receptive to potential customers at that time although we will continue to add to our database we intend to start adding marketing personnel to develop and implement a plan to bring our product into the marketplace we plan to add  marketing personnel per month beginning in late  until we reach a total of  at an approximate monthly payroll cost of  per such employee we expect that our marketing team will be fully assembled by the third quarter of  at that point much of the effort of our marketing team will be directed to developing a national marketing effort and formulating a plan and cost projection to carry it out our national marketing effort is not expected to commence until after september  the feasibility of our national marketing plan will be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and we have no assurances that this can be accomplished however it is not vital to our operations and we will implement it only when and if we have sufficient funds we have no present plans for any other business a major portion of our anticipated revenues is expected to come from pay per click fees which we expect will commence in late  we are presently generating  clicks per month and we have no agreements in place at this time to convert clicks to cash our rate structure will be a flat  per click compared to an average of  per click for google and yahoo the most measurable in our industry who generate more than  clicks per day we expect to increase our monthly click rate as our marketing activities increase banners will be sold on an annual basis starting as soon as possible after june  when we will attempt to convert all present trial basis freebanner sites to paid sites the program has not commenced no transactions have been recorded and no sums raised or fees received we intend to introduce a fixed price per click as opposed to the highest bid strategy employed by all known competitors which we expect to yield a following dedicated to true content matching rather than a ranking based on price this plan will be modified to offer discounts to sites producing the highest click ratings we believe this strategy is not yet in wide use and will require a series of modifications to test and prove the concept in the opinion of management the bidding concept for key words is not the proper customercentric way to determine the priority order of websites to be shown in search results we believe that showing the most frequently accessed sites at the top of the results list produces a more practical result for userssearchers offbalance sheet arrangements we have no offbalance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements development stage activities the company was incorporated in the state of delaware on november   and redomiciled in the state of wyoming on august   activities to date have been directed at developing a searchable directory of selected contents from the internet and raising capital through the issuance of the companys capital stock stockbased compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees consultants and directors based on their grantdate estimated fair values over the period in which the sharebased awards are expected to vest use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to reserves impairment of website development cost value of our stock issued to consultants for services and deferred taxes we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions however we believe that our estimates including those for the abovedescribed items are reasonable aug   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch most popular oj simpson made over  while in prison and won’t have to give any of it to

weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas in addition ife matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas the ife matrix is utilised in
