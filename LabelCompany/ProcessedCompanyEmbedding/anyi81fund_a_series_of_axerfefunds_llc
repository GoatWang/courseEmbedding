achieve total return comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing in a diversified portfolio of investmentgrade fixedincome securities with a weighted average effective maturity and effective duration of less than three years monthly income an actively managed shortterm bond strategy for investors seeking monthly income limited interest rate risk and total return opportunities quality   income   potentially limited interest rate risk designed for riskconscious investors the investment grade bond portfolio is composed of short term high quality government corporate and structured securities   the fund complements its core high quality bonds with measured exposure to high yield bonds which may provide opportunities for higher risk adjusted returns and incremental yield   the short term portfolio targets to keep the average effective maturity and effective duration a measure of sensitivity to interest rate risk less than three years which may limit investor exposure to changing interest rates footnotes  the average effective maturity of a portfolio is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds taking into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer effective duration is a measure as estimated by the fund’s portfolio managers of a bond funds price sensitivity to changes in interest rates it takes into account mortgage prepayments puts adjustable coupons and potential call dates the longer a fund’s duration the more sensitive the fund is to shifts in interest rates as of  morningstar

due to rounding holdings are subject to change and are not buysell recommendations fund documents prospectus and fund reports fact sheet profile sheet  about risk active trading risk active trading of portfolio securities may result in high brokerage costs which may lower the funds actual return active trading also may increase the proportion of the funds gains that are short term which are taxed at a higher rate than long term gains changing fixed income market conditions risk the current low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero increases in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may persist in the future potentially leading to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline in addition because of changing central bank policies the fund may experience higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs and potentially lower the funds performance returns collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if the fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner if an issuer seeks to restructure the terms of its borrowings or the fund is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of interest or the repayment of principal the fund may incur additional expenses changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event derivatives risk a derivative is an instrument whose value depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks which are described below counterparty risk certain derivatives do not trade on an established exchange referred to as overthecounter otc derivatives and are simply financial contracts between the fund and a counterparty when the fund is owed money on an otc derivative the fund is dependent on the counterparty to pay or in some cases deliver the underlying asset unless the fund can otherwise sell its derivative contract to a third party prior to its expiration many counterparties are financial institutions such as banks and brokerdealers and their creditworthiness and ability to pay or perform may be negatively impacted by factors affecting financial institutions generally in addition in the event that a counterparty becomes bankrupt or insolvent the funds ability to recover the collateral that the fund has on deposit with the counterparty could be delayed or impaired for derivatives traded on a centralized exchange the fund generally is dependent upon the solvency of the relevant exchange clearing house which acts as a guarantor for each contractual obligation under such derivatives for payment on derivative instruments for which the fund is owed money leverage risk many derivatives do not require a payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative which creates a form of leverage as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative leverage may therefore make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss the fund segregates or earmarks liquid assets with a value at least equal to the amount that the fund owes the derivative counterparty each day if any or otherwise holds instruments that offset the funds daily obligation under the derivatives instrument this process is sometimes referred to as cover the amount of liquid assets needed as cover will fluctuate over time as the value of the derivative instrument rises and falls if the value of the funds derivative positions or the value of the assets used as cover unexpectedly decreases the fund may be forced to segregate additional liquid assets as cover or sell assets at a disadvantageous time or price to meet its derivative obligations or to meet redemption requests which could affect management of the fund and the funds returns in certain market conditions losses on derivative instruments can grow larger while the value of the funds other assets fall resulting in the funds derivative positions becoming a larger percentage of the funds investments liquidity risk there is a smaller pool of buyers and sellers for certain derivatives particularly otc derivatives than more traditional investments such as stocks these buyers and sellers are often financial institutions that may be unable or unwilling to buy or sell derivatives during times of financial or market stress derivative instruments may therefore be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or exit its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions to the extent that the fund is unable to exit a derivative position because of market illiquidity the fund may not be able to prevent further losses of value in its derivatives holdings and the liquidity of the fund and its ability to meet redemption requests may be impaired to the extent that a substantial portion of the funds otherwise liquid assets must be used as margin or cover another consequence of illiquidity is that the fund may be required to hold a derivative instrument to maturity and take or make delivery of the underlying asset that the adviser would otherwise have attempted to avoid other risks compared to other types of investments derivatives may be harder to value and may also be less tax efficient as described under the taxes section of the prospectus in addition changes in government regulation of derivative instruments could affect the character timing and amount of the funds taxable income or gains and may limit or prevent the fund from using certain types of derivative instruments as a part of its investment strategy which could make the investment strategy more costly to implement or require the fund to change its investment strategy to the extent that the fund uses derivatives for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market or market segment there may be imperfect correlation between the value of the derivative instrument and the value of the instrument being hedged or the relevant market or market segment in which case the fund may not realize the intended benefits there is also the risk that during adverse market conditions an instrument which would usually operate as a hedge provides no hedging benefits at all the funds use of derivatives may be limited by the requirements for taxation of the fund as a regulated investment company emerging markets securities risk emerging markets also referred to as developing markets are generally subject to greater market volatility political social and economic instability uncertainty regarding the existence of trading markets and more governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed markets in addition companies operating in emerging markets may be subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than companies in more developed markets securities law in many emerging market countries is relatively new and unsettled therefore laws regarding foreign investment in emerging market securities securities regulation title to securities and shareholder rights may change quickly and unpredictably in addition the enforcement of systems of taxation at federal regional and local levels in emerging market countries may be inconsistent and subject to sudden change other risks of investing in emerging markets securities may include additional transaction costs delays in settlement procedures and lack of timely information foreign credit exposure risk us dollardenominated securities carrying foreign credit exposure may be affected by unfavorable political economic or governmental developments that could affect payments of principal and interest foreign government debt risk investments in foreign government debt securities sometimes referred to as sovereign debt securities involve certain risks in addition to those relating to foreign securities or debt securities generally the issuer of the debt or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due in accordance with the terms of such debt and the fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default against the defaulting government a foreign government debtors willingness or ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by among other factors its cash flow situation the extent of its foreign currency reserves the availability of sufficient foreign exchange the relative size of the debt burden the foreign government debtors policy toward its principal international lenders and local political constraints certain issuers of foreign government debt may be dependent on disbursements from foreign governments multinational agencies and other entities to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt without the approval of debt holders some governmental debtors have in the past been able to reschedule or restructure their debt payments or declare moratoria on payments foreign securities risk the value of the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability in the home countries of the issuers of the investments by changes in economic or taxation policies in those countries or by the difficulty in enforcing obligations in those countries foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls foreign companies generally may be subject to less stringent regulations than us companies including financial reporting requirements and auditing and accounting controls and may therefore be more susceptible to fraud or corruption also there may be less publicly available information about companies in certain foreign countries than about us companies making it more difficult for the adviser to evaluate those companies the laws of certain countries may put limits on the funds ability to recover its assets held at a foreign bank if the foreign bank depository or issuer of a security or any of their agents goes bankrupt trading in many foreign securities may be less liquid and more volatile than us securities due to the size of the market or other factors unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk the funds investments in high yield debt securities commonly referred to as junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due and are more susceptible to default or decline in market value due to adverse economic regulatory political or company developments than higher rated or investment grade securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile these securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities and may be difficult to sell at a desirable time or price particularly in times of negative sentiment toward high yield securities liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments an investment may be illiquid due to a lack of trading volume in the investment or if the investment is privately placed and not traded in any public market or is otherwise restricted from trading certain restricted securities require special registration and pose valuation difficulties liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect there can be no guarantee that the advisers investment techniques or investment decisions will produce the desired results additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may affect the investments or investment strategies available to the investment manager in connection with managing the fund which may also adversely affect the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole the value of the funds investments may go up or down due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to the particular issuer such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for revenues or corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates regional or global instability or adverse investor sentiment generally the value of the funds investments may also go up or down due to factors that affect an individual issuer or a particular industry or sector such as changes in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value mortgage and assetbacked securities risk mortgage and assetbacked securities including collateralized debt obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations differ from conventional debt securities because principal is paid back over the life of the security rather than at maturity mortgage and assetbacked securities are subject to prepayment or call risk which is the risk that a borrowers payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling as a result the fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates thereby reducing the funds income mortgage and assetbacked securities also are subject to extension risk an unexpected rise in interest rates could reduce the rate of prepayments and extend the life of the mortgage and assetbacked securities causing the price of the mortgage and assetbacked securities and the funds share price to fall and would make the mortgage and assetbacked securities more sensitive to interest rate changes an unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool will adversely affect the value of mortgagebacked securities and will result in losses to the fund the fund may invest in mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages which are loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages privately issued mortgagerelated securities are not subject to the same underwriting requirements for the underlying mortgages that are applicable to those mortgagerelated securities that have government or governmentsponsored entity guarantees as a result the mortgage loans underlying privately issued mortgagerelated securities may and frequently do have less favorable collateral credit risk or other underwriting characteristics than government or governmentsponsored mortgagerelated securities and have wider variances in a number of terms including interest rate term size purpose and borrower characteristics municipal securities risk the risk of a municipal obligation generally depends on the financial and credit status of the issuer constitutional amendments legislative enactments executive orders administrative regulations voter initiatives and the issuers regional economic conditions may affect the municipal securitys value interest payments repayment of principal and the funds ability to sell the security municipal obligations may be more susceptible to downgrades or defaults during recessions or similar periods of economic stress municipal securities structured as revenue bonds are generally not backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality but rather the revenue from the particular project or entity for which the bonds were issued if the internal revenue service determines that an issuer of a municipal security has not complied with applicable tax requirements interest from the security could be treated as taxable which could result in a decline in the securitys value in addition there could be changes in applicable tax laws or tax treatments that reduce or eliminate the current federal income tax exemption on municipal securities or otherwise adversely affect the current federal or state tax status of municipal securities tba transactions risk tba transactions involve the risk that the securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the fund when entering into the tba transaction tba transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty will fail to deliver the securities exposing the fund to further losses whether or not the fund takes delivery of the securities at the termination date of a tba transaction the fund will nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying investments during the term of the agreement if the fund sells short tba mortgages that it does not own and the mortgages increase in value the fund may be required to pay a higher price than anticipated to purchase the deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale and thereby incur a loss a short position in tba mortgages poses more risk than holding the same tba mortgages long it is possible that the market value of the mortgage securities the fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that the market value of the mortgage securities the fund has sold short increases thereby magnifying any losses the more the fund pays to purchase the mortgage securities sold short the more it will lose on the transaction which adversely affects its share price the loss on a long position is limited to what the fund originally paid for the tba mortgage together with any transaction costs in short transactions there is no limit on how much the price of a security can increase thus the funds exposure is theoretically unlimited the fund normally closes a short sale of tba mortgages that it does not own by purchasing mortgage securities on the open market and delivering them to the broker the fund may not always be able to complete or close out the short position by purchasing mortgage securities at a particular time or at an acceptable price the fund incurs a loss if the fund is required to buy the deliverable mortgage securities at a time when they have appreciated in value from the date of the short sale the fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling tba mortgages short in addition taking short positions results in a form of leverage as a result changes in the value of a funds investments will have a larger effect on its share price than if it did not engage in these transactions us government obligations risk obligations of us government agencies and authorities receive varying levels of support and may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the us government which could affect the funds ability to recover should they default no assurance can be given that the us government will provide financial support to its agencies and authorities if it is not obligated by law to do so whenissued delayed delivery and forward commitment risks whenissued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery occurs in addition the fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies on the buyer or seller as the case may be to consummate the transaction and failure by the counterparty to complete the transaction may result in the fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be advantageous these transactions have a leveraging effect on the fund because the fund commits to purchase securities that it does not have to pay for until a later date these investments therefore increase the funds overall investment exposure and as a result its volatility typically no income accrues on securities the fund has committed to purchase prior to the time delivery of the securities is made although the fund may earn income on securities it has set aside to cover these positions zero coupon or payinkind securities risk zero coupon and payinkind securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in value and less liquidity in the event of adverse market conditions than comparably rated securities paying cash interest at regular interest payment periods prices on noncashpaying instruments may be more sensitive to changes in the issuers financial condition fluctuation in interest rates and market demandsupply imbalances than cashpaying securities with similar credit ratings and thus may be more speculative investors may purchase zero coupon and payinkind securities at a price below the amount payable at maturity because such securities do not entitle the holder to any periodic payments of interest prior to maturity this prevents any reinvestment of interest payments at prevailing interest rates if prevailing interest rates rise the higher yields and interest rates on payinkind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon loans payinkind securities may have a potential variability in valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral special tax considerations are associated with investing in certain lowergrade securities such as zero coupon or payinkind securities as of  stbax nav change    nas may

prospectus and fund reports fact sheet profile sheet materials  resources investor guide  about risk bank loan risk there are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk interest rate risk liquidity risk and prepayment risk lack of an active trading market restrictions on resale irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the funds ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the fund as a result the fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations the risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks these risks could cause the fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment which in turn could affect the funds returns the value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the united states and abroad bank loans generally are floating rate loans which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates borrowing risk borrowing money to buy securities exposes the fund to leverage and will cause the funds share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the funds portfolio securities borrowing money may also require the fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so in addition the fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money there can be no assurance that the funds borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the funds returns changing fixed income market conditions risk the current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the federal reserve board frb and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero there is a risk that interest rates will rise when the frb and central banks raise these rates this risk is heightened due to the completion of the frbs quantitative easing program and the tapering of other similar foreign central bank actions this eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments particularly those with longer maturities in addition decreases in fixed income dealer marketmaking capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets as a result the value of the funds investments and share price may decline changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the funds transaction costs collateralized loan obligations risk clos are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress clos may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches market anticipation of defaults and investor aversion to clo securities as a class the risks of clos will be greater if the fund invests in clos that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the fund holds subordinate tranches of the clo that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches in addition clos are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk credit linked notes risk risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk interest rate risk credit risk default risk and in some cases foreign currency risk an investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price in addition credit linked notes may be leveraged and as a result small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the fund debt securities risk the prices of debt securities held by the fund will be affected by changes in interest rates the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors an increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longerduration debt securities and higher quality debt securities falling interest rates will cause the fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates falling interest rates may also reduce the funds distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the fund will decline the fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments andor to repay principal in a timely manner changes in an issuers financial strength the markets perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities the advisers credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event defaulted securities risk defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than nondefaulted securities defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale derivatives risk the value of a derivative instrument depends largely on and is derived from the value of an underlying security currency commodity interest rate index or other asset each referred to as an underlying asset in addition to risks relating to the underlying assets the use of derivatives may include other possibly greater risks including counterparty leverage and liquidity risks counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative as a result an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative which may make the funds returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price this risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions during which the fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions derivatives may also be harder to value less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the funds ability to use certain derivatives or their cost also derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits particularly during adverse market conditions financial services sector risk the fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions foreign securities risk the funds foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability changes in economic or taxation policies difficulty in enforcing obligations decreased liquidity or increased volatility foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits in which the fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls unless the fund has hedged its foreign securities risk foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time currency hedging strategies if used are not always successful high yield debt securities junk bond risk investments in high yield debt securities junk bonds and other lowerrated securities will subject the fund to substantial risk of loss these securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuers ability to pay interest and principal when due are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile liquidity risk the fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and as a result could lose its entire investment in such investments liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress if a significant amount of the funds securities become illiquid the fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices management risk the fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the advisers judgment about markets interest rates or the attractiveness relative values liquidity or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the funds portfolio the fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect additionally legislative regulatory or tax developments may adversely affect management of the fund and therefore the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objective market risk the market values of the funds investments and therefore the value of the funds shares will go up and down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably market risk may affect a single issuer industry or section of the economy or it may affect the market as a whole individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments such as bonds during a general downturn in the financial markets multiple asset classes may decline in value when markets perform well there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the fund will rise in value risk of subordinated debt perpetual subordinated debt is a type of hybrid instrument that has no maturity date for the return of principal and does not need to be redeemed by the issuer these investments typically have lower credit ratings and lower priority than other obligations of an issuer during bankruptcy presenting a greater risk for nonpayment this risk increases as the priority of the obligation becomes lower payments on these securities may be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of subsidiaries and associated companies of an issuer additionally some perpetual subordinated debt does not restrict the ability of an issuer’s subsidiaries to incur further unsecured indebtedness as of  afrax nav change    nas may appear until data is available data is
