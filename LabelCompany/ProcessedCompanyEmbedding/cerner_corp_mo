doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a disaster according to phillip longman a senior fellow at the new america foundation longman wrote according to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal pediatrics mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled from  percent before the installation to almost  percent afterward defenders of cerner in the study charged that the pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the cpoe system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth and did not have order sets preprogrammed on day one they noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems in  cerner and other companies paid for a report by the rand corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records including savings of  billion a year or more which rand now says is overstated this report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions

widely seen as inflammatory and poor management and cerners stock price fell  over three days in  the installation of a computerized health system by cerner in the childrens hospital of pittsburgh of upmc made it harder for the doctors and nurses to do their jobs in emergency situations and resulted in a disaster according to phillip longman a senior fellow at the new america foundation longman wrote according to a study conducted by the hospital and published in the journal pediatrics mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled from  percent before the installation to almost  percent afterward defenders of cerner in the study charged that the pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the cpoe system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth and did not have order sets preprogrammed on day one they noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned the implementation did not experience the same problems in  cerner and other companies paid for a report by the rand corporation which predicted great efficiencies from electronic health records including savings of  billion a year or more which rand now says is overstated this report helped drive growth in the electronic health record and billions of dollars in federal incentives to hospitals and doctors cerners revenue tripled from  billion in  to a projected  billion in  the study was criticized by the congressional budget office for overstating potential savings a  reassessment of the  report by the rand corporation said that the conversion had failed to produce savings and had mixed results in efficiency and patient

qualify for federal incentive payments and in september  notified the hospital that it was abandoning the project according to a lawsuit girard filed against cerner cerner and executives at girard

the journal pediatrics mortality rates for one vulnerable patient population—those brought by emergency transport from other facilities—more than doubled from  percent before the installation to almost  percent afterward defenders of cerner in the study charged that the pittsburgh hospital did not adequately prepare for the transition to the cpoe system in that it had at the same time significantly changed its pharmacy process did not provide adequate wireless bandwidth and did not have order sets preprogrammed on day one they noted that other hospitals that more carefully planned

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf
