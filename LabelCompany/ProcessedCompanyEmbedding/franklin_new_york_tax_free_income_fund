of a funds historical riskadjusted performance it is calculated by taking a funds excess return over that of the threemonth treasury bill divided by its standard deviation higher values generally indicate better historical riskadjusted performance based on the  years ended as of the date of the calculation the annualized percentage difference between a funds actual returns and its expected
