 shareholder letter john maxfield johnmaxfield apr   at pm citigroup ceo michael corbat image source citigroup investors in citigroup nysec would do well to read ceo michael corbats latest letter to shareholders available as a part of the banks  annual report but for those of you who dont have the time or the interest of doing so here are three key points that corbat discussed in his yearly message  citigroup is leaner and meanercorbat has worked over the last three years to tighten citigroups focus around the banks core business lines last year marked a continuation of this it was defined by the tangible progress we made in a sustained effort to transform and reshape citi into a simpler smaller safer and stronger institution  more than it has been at any time since the financial crisis corbat wrote the bank has made progress on a number of fronts over the last three years head count is down by  people assets are down by over  billion legal entities have been reduced by over onethird branch network is nearly  smaller eliminated  operations centers even in light of these changes citigroup had a banner year in  its  billion in net income was more than double its previous years profits and equated to the banks best annual performance since   shifting to offensewith the wind at its back corbat claims that citigroup is ready to switch from the defense to the offense in  we began to shift our strategic posture from defense to offense in a number of areas markets and businesses critical for future growth while we remain in a difficult environment through our expense discipline we are creating the capacity to make targeted investments in businesses that are well positioned to drive revenue growth in its global consumer bank this encompasses three priorities first concentrating its physical presence in highimpact locations in leading urban centers second investing in its us credit card business and positioning it for greater and faster growth and third establishing a new unit citi fintech to accelerate its mobilefirst approach to consumer banking meanwhile the banks institutional clients group is zeroing in on its biggest and most profitable clients as corbat noted in our institutional clients group we intend to build on our market share gains by continuing to focus on a comparatively smaller number of multinational corporations financial institutions asset managers hedge funds private equity firms and public sector entities with sophisticated needs for wholesale banking products and services  citi holdings eked out profitsthe extent of improvement at citigroup is probably best illustrated by the performance in  of citi holdings the division tasked with administering and offloading toxic and noncore assets accumulated before the crisis three years ago corbat laid out a number of financial goals and targets that were designed to illuminate the path forward among others was the goal of bringing citi holdings to the breakeven point by  not only did citigroup accomplish this the neerdowell business unit even turned a profit last year citi holdings reported just over  billion in earnings in  since  the unit had lost money every year adding up to a total deficit of  billion thus assuming that this marks a turning point in citigroups postcrisis trajectory the closing of this chapter will come as
