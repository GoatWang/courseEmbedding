will comply with the financial accounting standards defined under the jobs act or will take advantage of the optional extended transition period before doing so section  of the jobs act allows an egc to forego any or all of the disclosure exemptions any egc that opts out of the extended transition period must make the sec aware of this decision when first asked to file a periodic report registration statement or any other sec report that falls under section  of the exchange act the new checkboxes on the listed forms serve as a standardized way to inform the sec of a company’s status
