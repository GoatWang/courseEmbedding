nutanix revealed a partnership with google around its new xi cloud services and calm orchestration software and outlined other pieces of its cloud strategy hyperconvergence is just a pit stop on the journey nutanix ceo and founder dheeraj pandey said of the evolution we spoke with pandey at the conference and the nutanix ceo elaborated on what the google partnership can do for nutanix why the hybrid cloud is another form of convergence and how running a public company is like a marathon of sprints what role will google play in nutanix xi cloud services dheeraj pandey its about making hybrid invisible how do you make hybrid cloud a true hybrid cloud so that it doesnt sound like converged infrastructure dheeraj pandey because hybrid can be extremely hacked up the way converged infrastructure was hacked up we had a purists view on what converged meant because it was all about software and running on homogenous x servers it started on compute and storage but then we added virtualization we added networking and security so that journey has to continue were seeing that we now need to converge two different things and they dont need to be hardware boxes they happen to be data centers one of them is owned by us the other one is not owned by us thats how xi was born then the question was how do we execute in xi the google partnership came along just at the right time we said rather than going it alone and learning about security and geographic distribution and dark fiber networks how about we actually double down with a really good partner who understands these things really well and who also has a very good handle on highlevel platform as a service paas that theyre working with developers on and that will basically bring a cloud that is both paas and infrastructure as a service iaas because just simply infrastructure by itself is interesting but not complete what specifically will you do with google technology pandey we will take kubernetes for example and try to make it a hybrid cloud api now what does that mean kubernetes right now is focused on containers we will obviously make it run both in private and public clouds but well also make it work between containers and virtual machines you have to hybridize that as well and calm becomes that place calm can be used to hybridize the experience between containers and virtual machines in private and public clouds if you can implement xi inside google cloud platform then its a win for both sides will google host xi or will you maintain your own cloud as well pandey well were not exclusive with google so well continue to do our own things as well but we can actually learn what google is very good at because theres an architecture thing here about whether we can just use the pops points of presence to just backhaul everything to a large data center or do we need or have smaller data centers in the metros these cloud architecture discussions will clarify what you just asked you said you had a different take on converged infrastructure from the start do you see the early converged infrastructure vendors now sharing your vision pandey of course the thing is theyve come to hyperconvergence after four or five years and the ball has moved yet again to hybrid clouds hyperconvergence is just a pit stop on the journey its really about software and operating systems its about being able to blend as many things as possible and public cloud is one thing that cannot be a silo with everyone getting into hyperconverged do you have to keep the ball moving to stay ahead pandey theres no finish line in the journey for companies that believe in innovation server vendors have come to hyperconvergence after four or five years and the ball has moved yet again to hybrid clouds its really about software and operating systems dheeraj pandeynutanix ceo and founder you do the ipod then you do the iphone then you do the ipad then you do the iwatch and you do the macos theres no finish line then you do the new siri then you need to do the car microsoft went through this too you first went against lotus then you went against novell then you went against pc players then you went against oracle and on and on and on at next last year nutanix was still waiting to go public after a long wait you finally completed your initial public offering last september how has going public changed nutanix and your job as nutanix ceo pandey in many ways it hasnt changed us and in some ways it has we cant be confused about who we want to be we are still a growth player we are still about innovation we are still about disrupting the incumbency and that hasnt changed being private or being public wall street wont force us into something else only when something stops working because they dont see innovation when they dont see modernization of research and development will they say look if your strategys not working you better use my strategy for a young public company sometimes it only takes one bad quarter for that to happen pandey to me wall street is like strict parents if you do a good job then theyll let you be and they want you to be a better company every day thats the way the board has been for this company the last seven or eight years all theyre saying is when youre building your company make it a marathon of sprints every quarter is a sprint so make it a marathon of sprints im not going to get in the way of your marathon vision but dont lose track of the sprint model by the way thats where development is headed agile development is about sprints engineers are impatient i cant wait two years to release my code therefore there are sprint models in agile development every quarter of financial reporting that scrum is that agile development that were actually doing in some sense people bemoan quarterly milestones but at the end of the day thats what were expecting our engineers to do what is your marathon vision as the nutanix ceo pandey from very early on we have been clear and had the conviction for what the architect of computing needs to be many others bent over backwards with vmware we didnt when everyone was building a tab in vcenter we built prism we said thats the way we need to rearchitect the data center it was bold and audacious we dont have to bend over backwards we have to have respectful discussions on strategy and thats what were having with wall street right now if our strategies work if our research and development is monetizing and we are growing at the rate were spending then well be fine if we start spending more than we grow theyll ask questions on the business side you must spend a lot of time managing relationships with server vendors you have partnerships with all the major vendors or their resellers yet they all sell hyperconverged appliances that compete with nutanix pandey apart from dell emc which owns vmware at an arms length none of the other server companies have an operating system they own a hardware company and they need an os the only oses they can find are vmware microsoft and nutanix as with most things in life you focus on the overlapping interests and dont focus on the negative part which is the conflict of interests and thats how a community of nations operates you cant be complete friends you cant be complete enemies you have your own interests you focus on the overlaps you have no formal partnership with cisco and it sells a hyperconverged system but resellers sell your software on its unified computing system can you see a formal partnership developing with cisco pandey i never say never some of our large customers experience our software on cisco hardware in production so cisco is now hearing from the grassroots this thing is good and its working and the more they listen to their customers the higher the probability of us working together in an official partnership but i cant give you a date i cant give you a time were in this negotiation process where the market forces will tell them this is a good thing do you see nutanix ever getting to the point where you only sell software on other vendors hardware instead of on your own appliance pandey i dont think well ever abandon the appliance that reference design keeps everybody honest in terms of how hardware and software comes together it shows how they should behave shows us the failure rates without hardware we could not build xi xi is end to end its not just software running in the ether it needs silicon thats what our appliances give us if we didnt know how to support all that it would have been way harder to build xi hyperconverged users who dont buy nutanix often say its because nutanix costs too much how do you respond to potential customers scared off by price pandey i think people focus too much on hardware they focus on capex when they really should focus on working the whole body what we call the cost of ownership the hardware players want to provide cheap hardware but then they charge a ton of money for services and support and things that come afterwards we on the other hand believe a lot in automation and a lot in oneclick experiences that innovation comes upfront these days we have so many different pricing models we have subscription pricing and xi is another form of that people dont have to look at it as capex by the way hardware vendors cant sell it that way unless you lease from them but leasing is a hack actually you really need a multitenant architecture which is what the cloud provides but we dont talk about the cost of the hardware by itself we talk about how many people will be required how well provide you support for application security networking and migration weve written so many tools that we give out for free migration tools testing tools sizing tools that stuff costs money to develop and we dont charge anything for these tools do you have a pricing model yet for xi pandey it will come out in the next few months but it definitely will be a consumption modelbased approach not on cores because they dont see the cores those are multitenant cores it will be based on things they see the consumed

pandey ceo of nutanix dheeraj dheeraj pandey thank you tonya and hi everyone thank you for dialing in i am very pleased to report that we had a great quarter with record revenues of  million that were above street consensus and our guided range growing  yearoveryear we were also pleased to see our north america business return to strong growth in addition to continued solid performances from emea and apac third quarter billings were  million up  yearoveryear gross margins came in slightly above expectations and our eps performance was better than our guided range beating consensus by  our focus on driving sustained growth continued during the quarter driven by strong repeat business which represented  of our third quarter bookings also owing to strong momentum in large deals this demonstrates steady progress on deepening and extending our existing relationships with customers particularly in the global  our concentration on increasing our number of large deals paid off with two deals greater than  million in the quarter and  deals greater than  million further we reached a major milestone with our largest customer crossing  million in lifetime sales and still growing strong and while we made great progress expanding further into existing accounts in q we also sold into  new customers in the quarter including nearly  new global  customers this brings our total customer count to over  our oem partners dell and lenovo contributed well to our new global  customer acquisitions complementing a strong number of additions on the nx platform ahv hypervisor adoption continued to increase its  of nodes sold using our own builtin hypervisor up from  last quarter and  a year ago based on a rolling full quarter average our full stack operating system story including our ahv hypervisor our operations management software prism pro and our highly portable and multihypervisor multihardware stack continues to be a significant differentiator in our enterprise sales motion last quarter we discussed some changes we were making in our sales organization to sharpen our focus on larger accounts this process was a necessary part of our sales team evolution in critical and our next phase of growth as we target our next billion in billings we are pleased to report that we made very solid progress during the quarter with strong execution in hirings and alignment across our sales team particularly in north america where most of the changes were made we have hired several new team members with a focus exclusively on very large enterprise accounts and we continue to hire in support of these sales objectives in the coming months in addition to executing on our planned adjustments to the sales organization we further expanded our market opportunity but also extending hardware choice to enterprise cloud builders with several product announcements our software was initially filled with nutanix sourced industry standard x server since then we steadily increased hardware platform choice for our customers adding dell lenovo and cisco ucs cseries servers during the quarter we continued to deliver on this commitment to offering customers the broadest choice of hardware for their enterprise cloud deployments and announced three new supported hardware platforms first we announced termbased licenses of our nutanix enterprise cloud platform software for hewlett packard enterprises proliant servers and cisco ucs bseries blade servers we also signed a multiyear agreement with ibm to combine our enterprise cloud operating system with ibm’s power systems to deliver the industry’s first nonx hyperconverged solution targeting cognitive applications and big data workloads in large enterprises the solution will be sold to ibm and their partners exclusively in feature ahv hypervisor these new supported hardware options will broaden the deployment potential of nutanix beyond our current hardware partners to a large population of hp e proliant and cisco ucs servers already used in enterprise datacenters as well as to highest end powerbased applications in the large enterprise operating systems are all about ubiquity in apis our software now runs in a large population of intel x servers iot scale intel servers and palm sized formfactors ruggedized military equipment like crystal and klas and soontobereleased ibm power servers we have made great strides with apis to build an ecosystem of networking storage security and management software partners many of whom will be part of our next user conference in washington dc on june  today approximately  of our q new customer workloads are considered tier businesscritical applications including microsoft’s sql server oracle sap microsoft exchange hadoop and splunk legacy vendors typically our biggest naysayers would want to think otherwise but any new architecture that changes the consumption model has had the right of passage similar to ours our solutions have strong credibility in the enterprise with our growing number of global  customers today numbering approximately  continue to expand the missioncritical workloads with us we frequently see customers start with one workload as a trial or beachhead and quickly add workloads over time a great example of workload progression within the customer was a large deal in the quarter a very large us retailer doing well over  billion in annual sales in over  stores for the united states our relationship with this customer is a perfect illustration of how we expand in an account over time two years ago we began our relationship with a largescale virtual desktop infrastructure which essentially takes windows desktop to a cloud environment after proving the ease of use and the performance of our solution this customer quickly began standardizing our platform adding new workloads every few months today nutanix is deployed across all their major datacenters and the continued purchase pattern culminated in one of the largest commercial deals in the history of our company in q another great example of continued workload progression is with a global advanced wound care company with whom we signed a greater than  million expansion deal in the quarter this customer started using our solution for its remote office applications and then added to the nutanix cluster for disaster recovery over time this customer has grown their engagement to include our full stack solution including ahv for the core server virtualization another very large deal in the quarter was with a global  customer that is one of the largest cellphone carriers in the us with over  employees and over  billion in annual revenue this was an expansion that encompassed a number of workloads including a largescale vdi deployment and a large big data workload driven by our webscale architecture and the cloudlike simplicity of our solution we also had a great competitive win against legacy conversion infrastructure in a multimillion dollar expansion deal with a global  customer based in our emea region a multinational asset manager with over  worldwide employees whose opportunity encompass both vdi expansion and a large big data cluster in addition to increasing our footprint within many large customers in the quarter we also signed a number of large new customers in the quarter with many new deals greater than  million a good example of this was our largest new customer in q a global  customer that is one of the largest global stock exchanges based outside of the us our strong history of quickly extending customer engagements beyond the first workload gives us confidence that we will grow this and many of this for our new customer relationships over time we also continued to see customers recognizing that certain workloads having been moved to the public cloud a better managed on prem for example in q the largest ecommerce company in indonesia that had formally elected to run their marketplace in the public cloud moved its missioncritical workload back for cost and performance reasons on prem to our enterprise cloud powered by ahv the competitive landscape has grown over the past few quarters but we continue to perform very well against competition with strong win rates for example during the quarter we signed a large deal with a global  customer that is one of the largest european based brewing companies and a household name this customer selected nutanix for their oracle workload and a competitive win with ahv being a very significant factor in the customer’s decision we had a very similar win with an oracle workload in ahv at one of the largest medical supply companies in the us our oem partner lenovo contributed to our global  penetration closing a new logo together with us marking their largest ever deal with nutanix the customer large us based brokerage firm with over  billion in annual revenue selected nutanix in a competitive win against the traditional hypervisor stack scalability remains a significant differentiator for our operating system but chosen our ability to manage and grow very large customers we are very pleased with the number of customers that have grown this footprint with us and standardize their datacenters around our operating system in fact we have  customers that have purchased between  million and  million  customers that have purchased between  million and  million and  customers that have purchased over  million with us lifetime todate now let me share one final example we have shared that choice of hardware for a customer is a significant part of our growth opportunity in q we closed a large software deal running on cisco with a global  customer offering wireless and isp services towards  million customers in the us the new solution which will run nutanix and ucs blades will allow the customer to reduce the size of its cluster from  to  nodes utilizing our technology delivering significant roi for them the enterprise cloud market is growing faster than anyone imagine gartner estimates in its mail report forecast analysis worldwide integrated systems q  update hyperconverged integrated systems that the hyperconverged market will grow to approximately  billion plus in  we believe this predicted growth is read forth by the fact that nutanix solutions are powering more and more workloads in our customers’ environments including oracle sap and microsoft business applications and databases this is a very healthy backdrop for us to continue our strong growth by executing on our strategy while many of our metoo competitors read the formfactor of hyperconvergence as a destination we are focusing on an operating system which will holistically replatform the enterprise datacenter top down consumption of infrastructure is key to our vision which is why we are so focused on developer interfaces such as selfservice portals and applicationcentric automation we continue to build with ubiquity by offering customers’ choice of hardware choice of hypervisor and choice of public cloud providers for secondary storage all managed by a single controlled plane of prism building an operating system is a journey and no more than one or two are successful each decade it requires an immense focus in applications interoperability performance security automation and reliability and to make it all ubiquitous that is location agnostic is the biggest engineering challenge we remain extremely focused in investing in customer service and product engineering to maintain our lead as we rearchitect the enterprise the hybrid enterprise is the final frontier with that i will turn the call over to duston for a more detailed review of our q results duston duston williams thank you dheeraj for the rd consecutive quarter dating back to our first quarter of shipment we delivered record revenue in q above our target range this performance along with gross margins that was slightly better than expected resulted in nongaap eps that also exceeded our expectations revenue for the third quarter was  million growing  from the year ago and up  from the previous quarter we billed  million for the quarter representing a  increase from a year ago and a  increase from the prior quarter we also rebuilt a significant amount of backlog during the quarter notably our dell oem business accounted for over  of our ending backlog on a sequential basis our dell bookings declined in q by roughly the same percentage decline that we experienced in q of  as dell’s fiscal year end occurs in january our lenovo bookings increased sharply in q as dheeraj mentioned although we have the required execution ahead of us when it comes to sales segmentation we were very pleased with the rebound we experienced in our large deal activity again just for clarity we define large deals as customers purchasing more than  in any given quarter as you may recall during our q earnings call we mentioned the following three datapoints first we stated that over the last four quarters deals exceeding  averaged about  of total bookings second we noted that in q we performed somewhat below this level primarily in north america and lastly we predicted that the north america productivity would rebound over the next few quarters as a result of our planned sales adjustment i am pleased to report that not only the big deals as a percent of total bookings rebound back to around historical levels in q but specifically the north american productivity recovered nicely during the quarter in fact the north american sales rep productivity for ramped reps was the strongest performance we have seen since fiscal q  as you may recall we also are committed to provide investors with some additional datapoints to illustrate our progress in growing our large deals as a percent of our total business the following datapoint sheds some light on our q large deal activity global  customer traction as well as additional insight into a couple of our softwareonly deals you should not expect this level of detail on an ongoing basis first let me review some of the detail on our large deal activity in q we executed  deals greater than  million in bookings for a total of  million in bookings compared to only four deals greater than  million in the second quarter notably of these  deals ten of them either included no vdi or included other workloads in addition to vdi of the  deals greater than  million in q eight were global  companies and four were large government agencies three of these deals were to new customers and the two largest deals approximated  million each comparatively there was only one global  customer included in the q deal greater than  million in bookings now little bit further insight into our global  activity we had a record global  in q our global  bookings in q were  greater than in any previous quarter global  bookings as a percent of total bookings was the highest it has been in over two years in q  global  customers made purchases of greater than  million versus ten in q of these  global  customers that made purchases of greater than  million  of them either included no vdi or included other workloads in addition to vdi almost  of our existing global  customer base made repeat purchases in q illustrating the continued success of land and expand strategy and in q the average repeat purchase amount for global  customers was more than x of that of our nonglobal  customers we continue to focus on increasing software sales as a percent of our total product sales in addition to generating software bookings from our two oem partners and from premium software additions i’ll next provide a few highlights regarding a couple of our other softwareonly transactions in q we completed two ela deals with fortune  companies each with a  or more nodes and both representing repeat ela purchases we’ve booked many term license deals for the nutanix software running on cisco ucs and we completed an initial  softwareonly deal running on a specialized defenserelated hardware platform as i mentioned earlier we are very pleased with the q performance surrounding our large deal activity as well as our global  business we realize we have more work ahead of us but it is very clear that our focused efforts around large deals and driving further global  penetration is yielding positive results as expected in q our percentage of international bookings decreased from  in q  to  in q  compared to  in q  our billtorevenue ratio was  times which is slightly lower than the estimated range of  to  based on our current projections we expect q to be around  times our gross margin for the quarter was  which was slightly higher than our guidance and compares to  in the year ago quarter and  in the prior quarter we were pleased with the limited success with the price increases we enacted in q to counteract dram cost increases as expected dram and nand related ssd costs continued to rise causing our product cost to increase by about  during the quarter looking to q we expect significant additional dram cost increases while ssd cost increases should start to abate i’ll touch on margins a bit more when i review the guidance for q our operating expenses were  million and were in line with our guidance although the anticipated headcount increases in q and q  will be lower than historical rates we want to be clear that operating expenses are expected to increase by a minimum of  million per quarter over the next few quarters with an eye focused on continued topline acceleration additional spending will be funneled to demand generation investments with a majority targeting large customer opportunity we had a nongaap net loss of  million or  per share i’ll next provide a few balance sheet highlights along with a few other key performance metrics we closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  million that was down from  million in the prior quarter dsos on a straight average was  days three days higher than the  days reported in the prior quarter the weighted average dso reflecting the period in average receivables outstanding was  days in q versus  in the prior quarter we used  million of cash flow from operations as you may recall the q cash flow from operations benefited by  million from espp contributions the q cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by the same  million as shares repurchased under the espp yeartodate fiscal  we have generated a positive  million of cash flow from operations we used  million in free cash flow during the quarter although once again this was impacted by the  million of espp funding outflow software as a percent of total bookings based on a rolling four quarter average increased to  up from  in q i’ll now touch on our guidance for the fourth quarter revenue to be between  million and  million gross margins of approximately  and a per share loss of around  using weighted average shares outstanding of approximately  million regarding gross margins dram costs were once again increased substantially in q all things being equal this cost increase would push margins below their current level however we’ve set a target to hold margins at  and therefore we will alter our mix of software as needed to maintain this margin level it’s important to note that over the  month period ending july   our expected dram cost will have increased by nearly  resulting in a six percentage point impact to gross margin once dram cost start to decrease we expect gross margins to rebound back to the  level and then lastly regarding the new revenue recognition standard again known as asc  it remains our preference to early adopt this new standard starting in august  which is our fiscal q  pending the resolution of a few open items at that time we expect to recast our historical financial statements and in q under the new  standards based on a cost down estimate gross margins would have been approximately  to  basis points higher than we reported under the current existing revenue standards operator if you now open the call up for questions that’d be great thank you questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question is from kulbinder garcha from credit suisse kulbinder garcha thank you just a couple of questions please first of all on gross margin duston as we go forward i understand the cost increases impacting the fourth quarter but given the – software and the software license billings should that taking going to be coming meaningfully against the next fiscal year or how should we think about the gross margin trend beyond just the next quarter i mean the other question is maybe a broader one for dheeraj just in terms of dell just remind me how big it is which is revenues or billings in absolute and how is that relationship evolves and especially as the hypervisor you guys are selling gain traction many thanks duston williams yes this is duston so i’ll take probably both those i guess on the dell piece we haven’t broken that out typically we said back in the ipo it is never been bigger than  it’s a bit lower than that today as a percent of bookings and we’ve got lenovo that’s also starting to accelerate there also so we’ve got those two and then to your point of all software here dheeraj mentioned hp which we will get up at the end of the year here and then additional servers from cisco that would now qualify on so there is lots of opportunities here to continue that software increase dheeraj pandey hopefully i think just one thing to add on dell is that dell is an entire group called cpsd kulbinder and our software with their hardware is a significant chunk of their annual sales quotas so dell is morphing its business from traditional treaty to the new architecture and the three operating systems vmware nutanix and even microsoft azure stack are all relevant go to market motions for them but at the end of the day we control our own destiny with our clients and we compete and cooperate with dell on a dealbydeal basis and show that we have multiple routes to market its software elas and subscription for sps lenovo hx cisco ucs and going forward hp and ibm as well kulbinder garcha and just to clarify duston point on them you said it’s  on load and  of bookings that’s the comment just specific to dell and your hope is as these other oems ramp up that is just not your oem revenues more diversified in  months time let’s say is that how we should think about it duston williams yes yes that’s fair now yes it’s again the only thing we said in the past is it’s never been higher than  and it’s a bit below that today on the gross margin question kulbinder good question as we go forward two things happening obviously sooner or later dram cost will turn back in our favor so at some point we will have that benefit today we are still fighting it and it continues to be a headwind there although we’ve taken a stance on margins as i said and we are just going to basically alter our mix of software to add a minimum to try to get to the  we guided but going forward we should have the dram cost coming back in line your point about more and more software is valid and then the model gets pretty interesting as we adopt  because the flexibility again from a software and a margin perspective becomes much greater and it will allow us even to play off additional margin growth with topline growth again today when we do an ela that all gets deferred and gets ratable over the support period under  the license piece of that software will be a immediate hit to the revenue and gross margins along with the oem revenues that we have today from dell and lenovo kulbinder garcha and just in the nearterm have you changed your approach to hardware pricing my understanding always was as your software content builds you will continue to fairly aggressively price your hardware to drive adoption just in the near term have you held back a little bit on that just is that in anyway impacting sales duston williams not not significantly no no and we’ve got a lot of flexibility in the model to do what we need to do there we may tweak it a little bit this quarter for the  target but it should not be substantial there kulbinder garcha okay thank you duston williams yes and again that flexibility just wretches this up quite a bit once we adopt  operator the next question is from jason ader from william blair jason ader yes thank you hey guys a quick clarification and a question can you tell us how dell did sequentially and was it a slight headwind that’s the clarification and the question talking to investors in recent weeks it seems there is a growing anxt on the tam ceiling from hci that hci is struggling to move up market because their performance challenges and mixed workload in larger scale environments where do you think this kind of story is coming from and can you help address that concern dheeraj pandey yes i will take the second question but you will take the first question and dell sequential from their q to q duston williams yes if you look at the – and i mentioned this earlier if you look at in our q last year what dell declined as a percent of our bookings and their bookings there the decline quarteroverquarter this year as compared to last year was pretty much exactly the same and i think maybe i’ll just head this question off because we will have it in the future and we will open up a little bit here just because when we file our q everybody typically looks to the receivable balances magically under happy to be on how it ended up this way with customer and anytime it’s over  it’s shown in the q there last quarter i don’t know the exact number i think it was around  this quarter i’ll just tell you what the number is because the questions will come up once we file the q it was roughly around  so not too much difference there it’s a down quarter couple of things you got to consider there also when i mentioned backlog we have built a significant amount of backlog again  of that backlog related to dell so it’s obviously within backlog it hasn’t been built and it hasn’t gotten into receivables but i think you need to take that into consideration and then just quarteroverquarter the growth in the receivable balance itself this quarter grew roughly around  or  i think if you go back to last quarter it only grew maybe  or  so just some additional insights there to put that in perspective jason ader okay helpful dheeraj pandey thanks duston and on the tam question jason think about gartner in the last probably year year and a half there is already masters and queue from converged infrastructure or integrated systems and a hyperconverged integrated systems is the tam has gone from  billion to  billion to now  billion what’s really happening is that the incumbent legacy vendors who are doing a controlled cannibalization of their legacy business they are biggest naysayers of this v architecture and the proliferate their nay saying to analysts and media in my script i’ve talked about our ability to scale within the enterprise just to reiterate we have more than  almost  customers that have purchased over  million and  million and  plus customers that have purchased in  million and  million and  customers that have purchased over  million with us lifetime i talked about the customers that have more than  million results and many of them that are above  million and  million as well and most of this has actually come in the last  months if you take a look at jp morgan cio survey  cloud wars the name is the enterprise strikes back dated may   you will appreciate our seat at the table in the large enterprise because there is so much going in terms of rearchitecture in the large enterprise and tam is a function of workloads hardware platform diversity and formfactors people said similar things about virtualization in public clouds as well if you go back to my script we talked about numerous first workloads most of which are mixed workload deployments so i think again it’s a right of passage there is a perception that the incumbents would actually build here and we just have to plough through this jason ader thank you operator the next question is from wamsi mohan from bank of america merrill lynch wamsi mohan yes thank you dheeraj on the sales force reorientation how are you measuring the progress and how has this reorientation change the sales cycle size of the deals in the last quarter how are you expecting this to evolve over the next few quarters and i have a followup dheeraj pandey yes so we made some really good progress in q a lot of the heavy lifting of the design is behind us we continued to hire into our global accounts team and also doing some inhiring in the moving sales team members as needed to have them focus on the large customers and large deals themselves duston actually reiterated a lot of those and i also talked about many of those we are focused on three different productivities and we will go and look at the top of the pyramid the middle of the pyramid and the bottom of the pyramid whether it’s global accounts and enterprise accounts and commercial accounts and how they are doing productivitywise on a quartertoquarter basis wamsi mohan okay thanks dheeraj and duston your new customer adds at  was so pretty good but was that the level you had expected to add or is the sales execution issue is impacting that number could have been larger it sounds like the pace of new adds and sales hires are at least slowing down intermittently so if you could provide some context there duston williams yes no q is always – as you come off a strong q usually and it did  plus new customers in q so the  was a pretty good performance actually for q there we mentioned in the last quarter that we had slowed down headcount a little bit we are starting to accelerate that again selectively and in the right areas and things like that but that will continue to be fair amount of headcount adds as we go forward operator the next question is from simona jankowski from goldman sachs simona jankowski hi thank you your revenue guidance was quite strong and it sounds like there is fixed income or softwareonly deals to manage the gross margin situation and i believe you’ll lose out something like  of the revenue when you take those deals which implies that the underlying guidance is even stronger than it would appear so i just wanted to find out what is driving that and then secondly you talked about what the upside to gross margins would have been under the new accounting rule can you also quantify what the upside would have been to revenue thank you duston williams sure let’s see on the – your point on the topline and the impact by getting to    you noted in there i said if needed we’d swap to some more software so there is not a ton that we expect to have to do quite honestly we’ll see how the quarter progresses with big deals and bigger deals typically for the most part have higher margins as these bigger customers understand the value of the full stack and what we are trying to do here so we will see how that progresses but i wouldn’t read a ton into that that we are really damaging the topline based on holding to the  there may be some but it’s probably not significant from that perspective and then pretty much on your other question i just think it should be roughly a  to  ratio i got to think through that again revenue and gross profit there because it’s all software simona jankowski sure thank you duston williams for the most part dheeraj pandey and then the gross margin difference is something you already highlight right simona jankowski yes duston williams yes operator the next question is from alex kurtz from pacific crest securities alex kurtz thanks guys just a question and a clarification you guys have outlined getting to roughly a third of the business over the longerterm from software and inscription then i was just wondering if maybe you could give us an update on that maybe some timing over the next couple of years when that would be reasonable given all these new oems that you are working with and then a clarification around the cisco business it sounds like there is a little bit of momentum here and obviously they have global scale so maybe an update about where the cisco relationship sits today and where you think it kind of play out over the next couple of quarters dheeraj pandey yes thanks alex yes on the second question of cisco i think it’s still early days we are basically acting like a startup because it’s a startup idea and if you go back   years this is what virtualization is facing in terms of headwind because now the server guys really wanted to bless virtualization and then obviously the market force has actually convinced everybody that this is the right thing to do and in fact it didn’t reduce the server sales it actually increased because people could do more in the same amount of time so i think a very similar kind of headwind is upon us from companies like cisco and hp but we believe that the market forces will actually speak and we see some released strong momentum there from the market from the customers who actually very much like nutanix software running on their current cisco hardware so how things evolve in the coming years – coming couple of years and we cannot report every quarter but on the longterm onethird onethird onethird we still believe that’s actually a very feasible and sustainable model for us i think you have started seeing some elas you have started seeing lenovo actually made progress these two are very early starters both cisco and hp themselves and finally i think ibm could be dark horse we just don’t know yet because we don’t fully understand the ibm ecosystem so if you put all this stuff together and then there is obviously software that we are selling at high levels to the stack like prism pro which is our operations management software selfservice portal and then the acquisition we made about almost a year ago of calmio which is automation and orchestration all this stuff actually goes together to build our overall software portfolio so we are quite hopeful that we will get to the number which is onethird of our overall business in pure software alex kurtz all right thanks operator the next question is from matt hedberg from rbc capital markets matthew hedberg hey guys nice quarter dheeraj tierone workload seems particularly strong this quarter can you give us a sense for what some of those nonvdi workloads are and may be what are that tierone workload mix look like on a yearoveryear basis dheeraj pandey for the last question i don’t have the data we’ll probably have to check before we say anything about yearoveryear but i talked about microsoft sql server it’s a pretty big chunk of our deployments of that and oracle as you saw quite a few of those we have started to see a good bit of sap and splunk as well so i think on the whole i think pretty much anything that can be virtualized and has been virtualized in the past we are seeing all those big virtual machines come on nutanix and we also opened up this formfactor which is sort of a storageonly grid that can even work with physical applications that’s not been virtualized the beauty of the software is that it doesn’t care if it’s hyperconverged or not we can also cater to some of these physical applications and some of our customers that actually using that too so i think all in all we’ve been tracking to about – more than  of these tierone workloads across microsoft and oracle and sap and splunk and vdi is about a quarter of our business now matthew hedberg that’s great and then maybe duston the color on the  to  basis point gross margin benefit had  been adopted was helpful i am curious if we look at that on an ebit margin perspective is it the roughly the same benefit or should it differ from that  to  bps duston williams it’s roughly you’ve got commissions that would flow in there i guess but beyond that it’s pretty much the same matthew hedberg got it thanks guys operator the next question is from mark murphy from jp morgan mark murphy yes thank you and i’ll add my congrats i joined a few minutes late please forgive me if you might have already covered this but duston so i wanted to ask you just the very slight reduction in the billtorevenue ratio to  could you help us understand the underlying drivers of that and also is there some permanence attached to that as we roll forward and begin to think beyond the july quarter thats my first question and i do have a followup duston williams yes so on the ratio mostly that was – we always have some different mix in support and things like that those up and down but mostly that was because of the oem piece again a lot of that ended up in backlog a good chunk of it  of our backlog was dell lenovo had a piece of backlog in there too so again that would have been billed and not recognized so that would have pumped the ratio up a bit mark murphy okay and then as a followup so you mentioned a measurable improvement in the number of large deals in the quarter particularly in north america and i am trying to understand does that trend feel sustainable in other words do you think it happened  do you think it happened naturally or was it more of an effect of deals that slipped out of q and closed in q or perhaps did you set any special incentives for sales teams to buckle down and focus on larger deals in the quarter dheeraj pandey yes i think – i don’t think there was anything force there for q itself if you think about the architecture for a sales motion realize that we actually do not start with these  month long sales cycles because of the beauty of the product it’s an elastic fabric you can start at three nodes and the same system can go to  nodes over time so we see a customer with a kind of put a foot in the door with a k system and then they buy another  million and  million and finally in a matter of  months they might come back with a  million deal that didn’t take  months to close which is what typically happens in the enterprise selling that been anything that high value takes  to  months and in our case because we have actually broken the amount to smaller chunks existing customers come back with larger deals because the trust has actually built over time and therefore some of these large deals don’t take as long as it does for the old legacy infrastructure so i think we saw a lot of that happen this quarter the existing customers came back with large deals and it just happened to be fortuitous for us mark murphy great and then dheeraj one last quick one just given microsofts increasing emphasis as they are talking about the merits of this intelligent edge concept and forcing a huge audience really to think more about hybrid architectures is there any noticeable movement back toward private cloud or hybrid cloud that you can notice whether its relating to that or elsewhere and just have you seen any incremental signs of customers moving some of the steadystate expensive types of workloads off of amazon aws and onto nutanix dheeraj pandey yes i think we’ve seen quite a few and especially if these apps were not written with scale out sort of architecture in mind when we needed single large bm to perform really well or needed predictability and things like that so we have in fact i talked about one of them in my script as well a very large ecommerce player in asiapacific that brought all of it back because of not just performance reasons but also cost reasons i mean at the end of the day they went there because it was easy to use but finally when they found something which is just it is on prem they could just do it with very few people because one of the big costs of on prem infrastructure is people cost and when we take that away and bring it make it to be as elegant then people start to compare the economics and we’ve actually seen the economics to be quite different and we have started to show that in the lot of tco analysis to customers that renting a hotel with predictable workloads could be quite expensive when you leave or hang for the optionality of pulling the plug by the hour which is what public cloud charges you buy in many cases actually mark murphy thank you operator the next question is from katy huberty from morgan stanley katy huberty thank you good afternoon what percentage of your customers are paying for premium software today and should we expect that portfolio of offerings to expand over the next year and the penetration of customers or billings to increase dheeraj pandey katy if you look at the number of customers obviously there is a healthy mix of oems there as well which is something that you probably saw in q as well this – there are quite a few smaller retail customers who basically essentially become softwareonly customers for us because of our oem partners selling them their appliances but the ones that we are doing direct are mostly very large customers and i think getting to softwareonly deals with them takes a little bit of time because we need to first gain trust that this is a needed platform they want to rollout for everything and we’ve started to see some early signs in the last six months i would say when some of the very large customers are now saying let’s see if you can actually do elas with the nutanix operating system katy huberty but should we expect that portfolio of valueadded services analytics and security to increase and more opportunity for selling premium software into the installed base dheeraj pandey that is our hope actually in fact there is reason why we have such an effort going on and really looking at micro segmentation and network overlays and a lot of things around orchestration and automation is because we want to go and sell those things as a fullblown full stack operating system katy huberty right and then as it relates to the cisco and hpe business without a fullblown oem relationship should we think about selling into that hardware as a singledigit percentage of the business or is it possible that the channel could help you take that to a more meaningful level dheeraj pandey if you were to ask me as a ceo i would say it’s – we should expect the conservative and then i think there is definitely something you said about the channel because obviously there is multiple places that our software can meet the hardware the one on the left of the spectrum is where it meets in our factory the middle one is where it meets in an oem factory but we can also meet at the channel which is a very interesting thing that we have been thinking about especially because the channel also wants to make some money on this rather than just we sharing our profits with the oem partners operator the next question is from aaron rakers from stifel aaron rakers yes thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter curious as you look at the ibm opportunity how you are thinking about the ramp of that oem partnership should we think about something similar to the dell and now ramping lenovo relationships or do you think that ramp could come on quicker dheeraj pandey thanks aaron i think it’s early days it’s early days because we have some early inkling of the product and the workloads you are looking at i mean just trying to learn about the ibm ecosystem the sales force obviously there is a lot of excitement and the fact that they have ibm global technology services gts could be a very new thing for us as well power has real high end customers and very high end applications especially in the space of cognitive and big data applications and i think what mix is interesting is notably for the first time a single control plane a single data plane single hypervisor run time can now span intel x and power microprocessor’s hardware so i think that’s the beauty of what we are building that we can actually merge these silos we can be this silo busting software and no other hypervisor no other operating system has actually gone across these so there is something there which makes power no more just a silo aaron rakers okay and then with regard to the cisco relationship i know you mentioned its early days but as you garner more momentum how do you see cisco reacting given obviously they have their hyperflex product i am curious as you see that business grow is there the propensity for cisco to become a more formalized partner in your mind if hyperflex doesnt necessarily take off to the degree that they would like it to dheeraj pandey yes i think it’s a great question obviously it’s perilous to predict in these situations but one thing i’ve learned about the art of negotiation aaron is that what’s nonnegotiable today you have to figure out how to build the process so that becomes negotiable tomorrow and that’s the process they’ve been playing out with for the last nine months there hoping to actually have this process play out where cisco understands what hyperflex is and cisco also understands the value that we can bring to their rack bound servers because as you can see from their predictions and everything else that the blade business is actually weakening and kind of fading away in this new environment which is more webscale and cloudlike and rack mounts are a very different gross margin profile so i think there is something there between us but we continue to work in this art of negotiation where what was nonnegotiable yesterday could probably become negotiable tomorrow operator the next question is from jayson noland from robert baird jayson noland okay great thank you dheeraj i wanted to ask on lenovo you mentioned a sharp increase there and any color you can add and if you could frame the potential for lenovo relative to dell and then duston i wanted to ask on opex i think you said an incremental  million for the next couple three quarters i know youve got the conference in fq but how should we think about that for our models thanks dheeraj pandey i think on the first question we did a really good business within this quarter our joint largest deal todate with them was this quarter and they are doing well with us in the large enterprise verticals such as highend financials heavy industry retail sled healthcare and technology i think these are all very important verticals as we actually start to learn more about the partnership itself so i would say that there is a lot of transformation that lenovo itself is going through as a company they just split their pcg and dcg division so there is a lot of go to market stuff that we are codesigning and building together but the early signs look good and the fact global  is actually very much friendly towards lenovo is actually a great sign for us and for duston there was a question for you as well duston williams i am sorry jason consolidating expenses yes i think we’ve got a couple things obviously we have our customer’s next conference coming up shortly at the end of june we look at that obviously ultimately as demand generation and then in q we’ve got a lot of stuff going on we’ve got our worldwide sales teams with sales enablement that takes place in q to continue to train the sales teams on new offerings and value selling and things like that so along with headcount increases and other things as we go forward there i think we are going through the q expenses now but it has a chance of being – i said at a minimum of ten it has a chance probably a little higher than  maybe sequentially in q but once we get stabilized on the growth i think the big deals as long as big deals continue to be reasonably healthy that takes care of a lot of issues jayson noland okay thanks guys operator the last question at this time is from andrew nowinski from piper jaffray andrew nowinski hi thanks for squeezing me in just a question on ahv i think you had in one of your slides it was about  of nodes i guess just maybe just two questions along those lines are you charging for that and if so what percentage of bookings is ahv right now dheeraj pandey yes just like the public cloud andrew we are not really charging for the hypervisor it’s part of the overall value selling but we go and charge for the operations management software we have this control playing software which we call prism central which comes in the form of prism pro i think those are the kind of things we charge for but not the hypervisor runtime itself some of the features of the runtime like for example network security and things like that like we announced micro segmentation and so on they will be part of the pro in ultimate editions if you recall we have the good the better the best versions of our software the good goes with the life of the hardware but the better and best are term licenses that we actually sell for so some of these capabilities which are advanced capabilities go with pro or ultimate duston williams and just andrew on that  so we calculate that on a percent of total nodes but as you might expect that was tilted to a lower percentage of ahv so if you look at it on just nx nodes it’s actually quite a bit stronger than that andrew nowinski okay and then are you seeing clusters that deploy ahv are they actually ripping out their current hypervisor vendor and realizing some of the savings that you had talked about during your ipo roadshow that customers can achieve by using ahv dheeraj pandey well by definition if they are using ahv on our nodes they are not using any other hypervisor and if they have other brown field deployments where they are using the other hypervisors and you probably don’t keep account on those things but we know that we can definitely keep track of our own and now we are finally getting into some ela discussions where some of our very large customers with the last two three years are saying they really want to go all in an ahv which is when you will start to see some zerosum game andrew nowinski got it thanks guys dheeraj pandey okay operator i will now turn the call back over to the presenters well thanks everyone for joining us today appreciate all your questions as i mentioned before the most important thing for us this quarter is our annual next conference beginning on june th in washington dc and we look forward to seeing many of you there thank you operator
