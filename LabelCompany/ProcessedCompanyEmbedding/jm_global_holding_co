and one of our executive officers these loans will be repaid upon the earlier of the completion of this offering or december     million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement  million if the underwriter exercises its overallotment option in full will be placed in a trust account held at jpmorgan chase bank na located in the united states with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination if we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to industry specific regulation we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses a total of  million or  million if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering and the private placement will be placed in a trust account with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in united states government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds investing solely in united states treasuries and meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act except for any interest income released to us for working capital purposes or the payment of taxes or dissolution expenses none of the funds held in the trust account will be released subject to the requirements of law until the earlier of i the consummation of our initial business combination ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option subject to applicable law or iii otherwise upon our liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the  month period our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines in its business judgment that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business combination if we pay for our initial business combination using stock or debt securities or if we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination we may use the remaining cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement held out of trust and interest income on the amount in the trust account that may be released to fund working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our initial business combination this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable in this event we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us in addition if we increase or decrease the size of this offering it would result in a proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned in the trust account and available to us while we currently do not know what our future working capital expenses will be and while they will not necessarily be proportionate to the size of the offering we believe that any additional interest income earned would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration and consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition targets as of the date of this prospectus our sponsor zhong hui holding limited has loaned us  and one of our executive officers has loaned us  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans and any subsequent loans are and will be noninterest bearing unsecured and due at the earlier of december   or the completion of this offering in order to fund transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates or other third parties may loan us additional amounts although they are under no obligation to do so and provided any such loans will not have any claim on the proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon completion of an initial business combination if we do not consummate an initial business combination we may use a portion of any working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts however no proceeds from the trust account may be used for such repayment other than interest income earned thereon if such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts the unpaid amounts would be forgiven any part or all of such loans may be converted into additional warrants at  per warrant a maximum of  warrants if up to  is loaned and that amount is converted into warrants of the postbusiness combination entity at the option of such parties the warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to our sponsor the payment to an independent third party of a monthly fee of  is for general and administrative services including office space utilities and secretarial support although in the future our affiliates or affiliates of our officers directors or sponsor may take over the provision of these services for amounts not exceeding  a month this arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our initial stockholders directors officers or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our initial business combination we anticipate that our initial stockholders directors officers advisors or their affiliates would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their shares or that have indicated an intention to do so and engage in direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions all holders approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders there is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire our initial holders directors officers or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under regulation m under the exchange act or in transaction which would violate section a or rule b under the exchange act although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium purchase price for such public shares there is no limit on the price they may pay we will notify stockholders of such purchases if any by press release filing a form k or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  moreover the redemption threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination if the amount of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would cause our net tangible assets to fall below  we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i the consummation of our initial business combination ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option subject to applicable law or iii otherwise upon our liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of the  month period our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines in its business judgment that it is improbable within the remaining time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account the initial holders including our sponsor have agreed to waive their redemption rights i with respect to their founder shares and placement shares in connection with the consummation of a business combination and ii with respect to their founder shares and placement shares if we fail to consummate a business combination within  months from the completion of this offering excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option or if we liquidate prior to the expiration of the  month period however our sponsor and parties associated with it will be entitled to redemption rights on the same terms as other public stockholders with respect to up to  of  public shares which may be purchased by them in this offering they will waive their redemption rights with respect to the remaining  public shares that may be purchased by them in this offering in connection with the consummation of a business combination in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for a business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash to our public stockholders including to holders of up to  shares included in units which may be sold to our sponsor and its associated parties in this offering who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for an initial business combination in addition the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a blank check company formed in april  that will seek to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and activities relating to this offering we have not identified any acquisition target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any discussions directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any acquisition target we have generated no revenues to date and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination for our initial business combination we intend to focus on industries that complement our management team’s background focusing on the consumer products sector in the united states which may include a business based in the united states which has distribution opportunities outside the united states consumer products include goods and services that are bought for personal and household use and intended for direct use or consumption we will tend to focus on established products that have a long history of consumer demand are used frequently and must be replaced as opposed to durable items that people keep for a long time such as cars and furniture these type of products and segments are also easier to manage and operationally forecast of which our management team and directors again have much experience with we will seek to acquire established consumer product branded businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial operational strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value we do not intend to acquire startup companies companies with speculative business plans or companies that are excessively leveraged our acquisition and value creation strategy will be to identify acquire and after our initial business combination to build a diversified consumer products branded company we will focus on consumer companies that distribute a broad range of products for various customers and end use markets in either multiple channels a few examples are selling these products through retail stores purchasing online or via a direct selling experience but also might be limited in geography we believe our management team has prior and current experience and access to sales channels and consumer markets outside the united states as well that could be helpful in a consumer product business combination although our focus and efforts will be to acquire a consumer product business we are not however required to complete our initial business combination with a consumer products business and as a result we may pursue a business combination outside of that industry we will seek to capitalize on the significant consumer products experience and contacts of qi jacky zhang the chairman of our board of directors tim richerson our chief executive officer chief financial officer and a director and the financial expertise of peter nathanial our president and a director to identify evaluate acquire and operate a target business if we elect to pursue an investment outside of the consumer products industry our management’s expertise related to that industry may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation and the information contained in this prospectus regarding that industry might not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire we believe our management team has the skills and experience to identify evaluate and consummate a business combination and is positioned to assist businesses we acquire however our management team’s network of contacts and its investing and operating experience do not guarantee a successful initial business combination the members of our management team are not required to devote any significant amount of time to our business and are involved with other businesses we estimate that our officers will dedicate an average of  to  hours per week to our affairs we cannot guarantee that our current officers and directors will continue in their respective roles or in any other role after our initial business combination and their expertise may only be of benefit to us until we complete our initial business combination past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate we anticipate structuring our initial business combination to acquire  of the equity interest or assets of the target business or businesses however we may structure our initial business combination to acquire less than  of the equity interest or assets of the target business but only if we or any entity that is a successor to us in a business combination acquire a majority of the outstanding voting securities or assets of the target we believe that if we own a majority of the target’s outstanding voting securities we will not be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act since the securities of a majority owned subsidiary that is not itself deemed an investment company are not deemed to be “investment securities” as defined in the investment company act and since we expect that  or more of the value of our total assets excluding government securities and cash will be represented by the securities of our target business which we expect will be an operating business even if we own a majority interest in the target our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least  of the balance in the trust account less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination the fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses if our board is not independently able to determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the financial industry regulatory authority or finra and that is reasonably acceptable to cantor fitzgerald with respect to fair market value and that such an initial business combination is fair to our stockholders from a financial point of view however if our securities are not listed on nasdaq or another securities exchange we will no longer be required to consummate a business combination with a target whose fair market value equals at least  of the balance in the trust account less any deferred underwriting commissions or taxes payable on interest in addition to any potential business candidates we may identify on our own we anticipate that other target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources including investment market participants private equity funds and large business enterprises seeking to divest noncore assets or divisions in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass as applicable and among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews interviews of customers and suppliers inspection of facilities and a review of financial and other information about the target and its industry we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor initial holders officers or directors nor are we prohibited from partnering submitting joint bids or entering into any similar transaction with our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor in the pursuit of an initial business combination if we seek to complete an initial business combination with such a company or we partner with our sponsor one of our initial holders or any of their respective affiliates in our pursuit of an initial business combination we or a committee of independent directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of finra and reasonably acceptable to cantor fitzgerald with respect to fair market value that the business combination is fair to our
