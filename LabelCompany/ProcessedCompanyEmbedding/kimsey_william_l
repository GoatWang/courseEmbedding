regulation in the us today is entrepreneurship being stymied and is there still an opportunity to build leading companies there is the opportunity but it is being slowed particularly during the current period because of the tightness of money most entrepreneurs have to start their businesses with borrowed money and it is difficult now for anybody but particularly for entrepreneurs many of whom don’t have a track record of success banks want somebody with a proven track record also washington has been a negative influence on entrepreneurship and even the drive to achieve in business in general in the us there is an incredible amount of legislation containing many new regulations that has been produced in the past couple of years there is also a lot of uncertainty about the tax laws washington is talking about doing something about the corporate tax rate but at this point it has only been talk likewise the negative political rhetoric about wall street has not been encouraging to entrepreneurs or to business in general what can be done is there a need to bring more business leaders into the discussion yes it would be helpful if more individuals with solid business experience had greater influence in washington and in our state capitols entrepreneurs and business in general provide the engine that fuels our economy and jobs how has the role of corporate boards changed and are the board structures today more effective there is no question in my mind that they’re more effective there is much more of an emphasis on governance since enron worldcom and sarbanesoxley in terms of fiduciary responsibilities how board members are selected the diversity on boards the contribution of individual board members and the assessment of their own members today the work of boards and board committees is taken very seriously i’m also not familiar with any boards where the ceo or chairman handpicks members who will vote along with whatever he or she wants as happened in some cases in the past what is the most important characteristics you look for when the opportunity comes about to join a board first it’s the industry is it an industry you understand and have a real interest in also it is important to look at the company and how well it is managed what their market share is what their potential is what their legal experience has been in terms of lawsuits their funding the strength of the balance sheet and the quality of the management particularly the ceo then there are sometimes personal aspects for example in my case i was interested in being on boards of global businesses as that had been my experience and great interest what makes for a successful ceo today and do you see a drain of leadership i don’t see a drain of leadership there is more focus today on leadership than there has ever been in history and ceos today are more focused on the leadership aspect of their responsibilities and not just the management aspects what i look for first in a great leader is integrity as it’s essential for the ceo to set the right tone at the top for the entire organization the ceo must also have the right balance between humility and selfconfidence – ceos have to understand that it’s not about them as any good leader does he or she has to be someone who has persistence but not to the point of stubbornness ceos are in positions of change management – they have to lead change there is tremendous resistance to change especially if you’re talking about changing the whole organization and human behavior so it takes a lot of persistence but if that turns into stubbornness it can work against the organization it is also critical to have a disciplined leader in order to have a disciplined organization what made the arthur youngernst  whinney merger work so well that merger remains today the most singly successful merger of professional service firms of a large size in history and it was because of leadership the leaders on both sides felt like it would be a good strategic fit and had the boldness to take the risk – they were the first of the big eight to do this the merger was challenging from the inside there isn’t a single merger that involves a lot of people that is easy there are all kinds of personal agendas and mergers bring out the best in some individuals and the worst in others in order to merge a professional services firm like ey the top leaders sacrifice their career aspirations and they have to put their partners and the future of the firm ahead of themselves the three most senior ernst  whinney leaders and the three most senior arthur young leaders took the bold step in  toward a successful merger and laid the foundation for the great firm you see today the big eight is now down to four is that healthy the situation we have today is a product of some very unusual and unexpected phenomena of history from about  years ago the last merger of large accounting firms reduced the number of firms from eight to five which seemed fine at the time the independence rules for firms at that time were different allowing for a broader scope of services but then andersen was forced out of business through very aggressive treatment by the us justice department following the enron failure then following the failure of worldcom the sarbanesoxley legislation was passed which restricted the types of work that can be done for a given client by the same firm the legislation now makes it necessary for many corporations to retain not just one but at least two firms so the loss of andersen bringing the number of firms down to four along with the greater need now to use more than one of the large firms does reduce the choices for businesses we are fortunate however to have four highly qualified large global accounting firms capable of servicing the needs of large and complex global companies• click here to download a pdf of an interview with william l kimsey former chief executive officer

ltd nyse ose rcl today announced that its board of directors had named its first lead director approved a plan to replace staggered terms for directors with annual election and more than doubled the quarterly dividend on its common shares the moves which were approved unanimously at the boards september th meeting reflect the boards continuing efforts to enhance its corporate governance structure

content and scheduling of board meetings and discussions and will be available for discussion with major shareholders said fain im delighted that bill kimsey has agreed to become our lead director  hes been a consistent source of wise counsel and his voice will be even more important as we move forward said kimsey i am pleased by the steps our board has taken to further enhance our corporate governance and i look forward to working with my fellow directors and management to improve shareholder value the board of directors also adopted changes to its bylaws as a result of which candidates elected to the board will serve oneyear terms and will stand for reelection annually thereafter effective with the slate of directors to be elected at the companys  annual meeting  this implements a

the company with key decisions – including the selection of directors the choice of top management and the approval of major capital expenditures – made at the discretion of the two shareholders the

nominating and corporate governance committee   the board also approved an increase of the quarterly cash dividend to  per common share payable october   to shareholders of record september    this represents an exceptional jump more than doubling the previous  per common share dividend level said fain dividends are an increasingly important component of total shareholder return this dividend increase was made possible by our profitability improvement program and our improving financial position  it reflects our confidence in our ability to grow our investment returns into the future given
