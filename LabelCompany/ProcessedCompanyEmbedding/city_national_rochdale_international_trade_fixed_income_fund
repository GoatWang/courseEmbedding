please � refer to the funds most recent annual financial statements � � � � � � city national rochdale international trade fixed income fund schedule of investments march   unaudited continued summary of fair value exposure the fund follows fair valuation accounting standards which establish an authoritative definition of fair value and set out a hierarchy for measuring fair value��these standards require additional disclosures about the various inputs and valuation techniques used to develop the measurements of fair value and a discussion in changes in valuation techniques and related inputs during the period��these standards define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date��the fair value hierarchy is organized into three levels based upon the assumptions referred to as �inputs� used in pricing the asset or liability��these standards state that �observable inputs� reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources and �unobservable inputs� reflect an entity�s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability the fund pursues its investment objectives by investing primarily in trade finance structured trade finance export finance and project finance loans and other forms of debt obligations of companies banks or other entities including sovereign entities located primarily in or having exposure to global emerging markets � city national rochdale investment management llc the �manager� or �adviser� is the investment adviser to the fund��the manager has selected gml capital llp a limited liability partnership formed in england the �subadviser� as subinvestment adviser with respect to the fund securities listed on a securities exchange market or automated quotation system for which quotations are readily available except for securities traded on nasdaq including securities traded over the counter are valued at the last quoted sale price on the primary exchange or market foreign or domestic on which they are traded on the valuation date or at approximately pm et if a security�s primary exchange is not normally open at that time or if there is no such reported sale on the valuation date at the most recent quoted bid price for securities traded on nasdaq the nasdaq official closing price will be used if such prices are not available the security will be valued as set forth in the fund�s fair value policy debt securities are priced based upon valuations provided by an independent thirdparty pricing agent if available such values generally reflect the last reported sales price if the security is actively traded the thirdparty pricing agent may also value debt securities at an evaluated bid price by employing methodologies that utilize actual market transactions brokersupplied valuations or other methodologies designed to identify the market value for such securities such methodologies generally consider such factors as security prices yields maturities call features ratings and developments relating to specific securities in arriving at valuations debt obligations with remaining maturities of sixty days or less may be valued at their amortized cost which approximates market value bank loans trade finance structured trade finance export finance and project finance loans and other forms of trade finance debt obligations are priced based on valuations provided by an independent third party pricing agent if available if a price is not available from an independent third party pricing agent the security will be valued as set forth in the fund�s fair value policy the fund has contracted with debt domain to provide prices for the trade finance related fixed income securities it holds��a change in such pricing agent shall require prior approval of the fair value committee and the fund�s board however in situations when the change would not materially affect valuation of the fund�s net assets or would involve an immaterial departure in pricing methodology from that of the fund�s existing pricing agent board ratification of a change in the pricing agent may be obtained at the next regularly scheduled board meeting��the fund�s advisor and subadviser shall monitor the reliability of prices obtained from any pricing service with respect to such securities and shall promptly notify the committee if it reasonably believes that a pricing service is no longer a reliable source for prices � � � � � � the subadviser generally selects trade financerelated securities for investment by the fund to be held to maturity and will base its estimation of fair value on this presumption where the subadviser decides that the fund will not to hold the security to maturity the basis of its fair value estimates will differ��in general fair value represents a good faith approximation of the current value of an asset and will be used when there is no public market or possibly no market at all for the asset when making a determination of the fair value of a trade financerelated security the subadviser will consider a variety of factors that will include but not be limited to  the cost andor repayment performance of the underlying trade financerelated security  the last reported price at which the investment was traded  information regarding the investment the issuer and its sector country or region  changes in financial conditions and business prospects disclosed in the issuer�s financial statements and other reports  any publicly announced transaction involving the issuer  comparisons to other investments or to financial indices that are correlated to the investment  with respect to fixed income investment changes in market yields and spreads andor  other factors that might affect the investment�s value the fair values of one or more assets may not be the prices at which those assets are ultimately sold in such circumstances the subadviser will reevaluate its fair value methodology to determine what if any adjustments should be made to the methodology for determining the valuation��where investments are valued using this methodology and are valued by the subadviser they will be considered level  assets where investments are valued independently by a third party such as debt domain using such a methodology they will be considered level  assets with respect to other securities and investments securities for which market quotations are available but which are restricted as to salability or transferability are valued as provided above less an appropriate discount determined at the discretion of the subadviser or if deemed appropriate in the subadviser�s discretion by an independent third party based on the nature and term of the restrictions��investments valued under this methodology are considered level  assets various inputs are used in determining the value of the funds investments��these inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below level   unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the fund has the ability to access level   observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market prices for similar instruments interest rates prepayment speeds credit risk yield curves default rates and similar data level   unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent relevant observable inputs are not available representing the fund�s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and would be based on the best information available � � � � � � the inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities � the following are the classes of investments at march
