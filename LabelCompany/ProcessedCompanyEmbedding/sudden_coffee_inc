single origin coffees we use highquality singleorigin beans singleorigin means all the beans in a batch came from the same farmer we use single origin beans because they allow sharp and distinct flavors to come through in the coffee we rotate our coffees every couple months so you get to try new flavors  with single origin beans the coffee farms run out of a specific coffee  therefore we have to keep fresh “green coffee’s” coming in from our roasters each season roast we use coffees that are roasted on the lighter range of the spectrum again lighter roasts preserve a lot of the distinct and interesting flavors instead of giving you that burnt taste we all know too well we do not roast coffee ourselves we work with a few premium roasters in the industry  th parallel ritual roasters and saint frank coffee brewing even with the best beans a lot of the magic happens during brewing your barista is in charge of extracting the best elements from the beans to extract the coffees perfectly wellbrewed coffee is sweet and mellow  reflects the characteristics of origin where the coffee is grown however poorly brewing the same beans can result in sour and or bitter flavors we use a rigorous and consistent process to extract the best flavors out of our coffee results the combination of these aspects results in coffees that have special flavors depending on their origin you will get different notes coffees from east africa typically have fruity notes such as blueberry or citrus while central american coffees tend to be more chocolatey and round the flavors in our coffees are delicate and smooth due to the intense focus that is given to them throughout the whole process the taste should never be burnt or bitter our coffee is super smooth  no need cream and sugar news
