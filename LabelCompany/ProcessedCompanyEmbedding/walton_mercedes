i was actually looking for a used one but after several dealers several online dealers in a tristate area we arrived at gary smith honda they had exactly what i wanted in a new car with the features i want but needed to see if we could come together on a price the first sales men we worked with seemed clueless and were rude as well as unprofessional now when i say that i am not sure if he was just so new that he was so naive enough to tell us what the management said to him i can give you an example we have what you want now that we know what you want if you go to another dealer we will not work with that dealer by sending this car there so you either buy it from us and do not buy one to say the least we felt trapped we called every dealership in a  mile radius to try and find the car we wanted no one had it guess we either suck up our pride or look at something else i am extremely picky so we sucked up the pride so we make an appointment to pick up the car car was not ready nothing was done wasnt even washed not putting his name here because well you can probably pick him out of a line up very easily showed up and decided we no longer wanted to work with the first salesmen we can suck up our pride but doesnt mean we want to talk to him again this time todd siegrist came to our help thank god todd siegrist was awesome by the time we were complete with all the paperwork car was fixed and ready to go he showed us what the car could do all the new updated equipment etc i would have brought him and his family home for dinner great salesmen good sense of humor patient did not try and sell us anything more than the car very laid back and relaxed todd made us happy we came back happy we did add the extra items happy we asked for a different salesman happy enough to come back and recommend todd to friends and family with no reservations he even connected my phone to the new car showed me how to use my music with the car would happily spend my money with him again when we need a car to gary smith honda  todd saved the companys image in our eyes he should get full credit for the sale for the small amount of time we spent with the other salesmen he should have only gotten a hourly wage and no commission he almost lost the sale and caused us to tell everyone how bad it was with him and gary smith todd siegrist needs a raise salesmen of the month or any type of pat on the pack you provide to motivate your salesmen i love my car i love the color the style the leather everything proud owner of  honda accord v exl buy your next car with todd siegrist at gary smith hondasonshine motorspjelpoeta ratedi believe in honest feedback and review i bought a vehicle from sonshine motors a jetta about a month ago firstly customer service is very good because they are trying to get you into a reliable car with reliable payments without credit secondly the cars are average to very good we fell in love with our car the moment they let us test drive it however what made me give them this perfect review is the honesty our vehicle had a slight mechanical failure on the transmission that was actually a factory defect according to the shop but was simply past its warranty russ was a gentleman by covering for the repair costs even though what you buy is quotas isquot just because we had just bought the car this does not mean that their vehicles are bad because they have great vehicles but is not their fault if one or two have faults because they are used vehicles and it can happen anywhere i would recommend this business to others if you have less than perfect credit and need a reliable car from people who keep their word go see for yourself also they constanlty updated their inventory so if you dont see something you like come back another day hampton hyundaimaxhertweck ratedhyundai serviceim writing this review because i saw some negative reviews for hampton hyundau this year i took my genesus to hampton i was a new resident in the area and had apprehension about the visit due to reviews i had readupon arrival i met a service advisor rachel who was the most friendly accommodating representative i have met in my dealings with auto dealerships she went out of her way to insure my problem was resolved arranged for a car rental and followed up to be certain the problem was taken care of i really appreciated the attention i was given im now happy that i live in the gulf coast area so that i can have a service department i can depend on thank you rachel sonshine motorsjjess ratedgood service and people just wanted to leave a review in response to some of the bad ones i know everyone has good and bad experiences but i bought my car a few days ago on my way home the car started acting funny i called the dealership the next day they came and towed it fixed the alternator and brakes and didnt charge me a dime these people are honest and if you call or go to the office with a genuine concern and a good attitude they will help you i didnt have a warranty and im on such a fixed budget i was so woried about the repairs as a single mom i just dont have extra money overall a real good experience from the sales man and manager sonshine motorsjames p ratedi am the first person to read reviews about a business before i do business with them i read mixed reviews about sonshine motors some good some bad some horrible most of the bad ones seemed to come from people who obviously didnt pay their bills on time since i couldnt get financed anywhere else due to my bad credit i came to them i just want to say thank you for the awesome service and helping me find a vehicle with payments that i can afford my car is still running great  months after ive had it with no issues thanks again guysgary smith hondanancy
