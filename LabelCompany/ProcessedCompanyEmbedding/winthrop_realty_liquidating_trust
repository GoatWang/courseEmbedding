liquidation investingjun  about winthrop realty fur valueartifex value growth at reasonable price smallcap longterm horizonsummarywinthrop realty trust is preparing for the final phase of its liquidation after gradually divesting assets for several quarters and paying off debt and senior obligationsin the first week of august shares of winthrop will be exchanged for nontransferrable units in a liquidating trust which will disburse proceeds from winthrops orderly liquidation to investorsdue to structural factors associated with nontransferable assets shares of winthrop have declined significantly ahead of the companys pending delisting from the nyse due to forced institutional and index sellingcurrently priced at  per share investors stand to receive over  in cash once the remainder of winthrops portfolio is wound up a  premium over the quoted pricethough impossible to predict how long liquidation will take management is moving swiftly with a  year irr profile of  investors are positioned to realize substantial valueknowing when to fold em in my years of investing and observing the markets i have come to the conclusion that one of the hardest decisions to make in business is knowing when to throw in the towel some businesses for whatever reason simply cannot survive for much longer in the future examples are numerous throughout history you could have been a horse and buggy manufacturer in the early days of the automobile a netsuke carver in early modern japan or blockbuster in the age of netflix typically management of troubled companies is often slow or unwilling to acknowledge that their best days are behind them and they often take shareholders with them as the company enters a period of long decline in other cases the management of the company could be a major factor responsible for the success of the business and when they decide to retire or to move on the most prudent course of action is to sell off assets to capture maximum value for shareholders rather than risk their accomplishments and legacies being eroded one thing is certain however whenever a company decides to liquidate value investors become quite interested this type of investing known as liquidation investing requires investors to investigate the company or underlying assets held for sale and then arrive at a conservative estimate of their value on a per share basis once all liabilities are satisfied this type of investing requires considerable patience a tolerance for illiquidity and lumpy returns as well as a firm understanding of the factors that led to the underlying situation despite the fact that there are numerous examples of obsolete and dying businesses in both the public and private sphere there are relatively few cases in public markets where the management of the business does the right thing for shareholders and winds the company down in an orderly fashion though these situations are rare they can offer a patient and attentive investor a significant chance to profit this article is about one such situation a company which is about to enter into the final stages of liquidation is winthrop realty trust nysefur representing an opportunity that could offer the right kind of patient investor attractive returns over the course of its orderly liquidation after coming to the conclusion that the company was better off being liquidated in  the management of winthrop has taken steps to divest assets and satisfy most of the companys outstanding liabilities while paying a large collection of special dividends out to the shareholders now the final act is about to commence and the equity of winthrop will be delisted and exchanged for nontransferable units in a liquidation trust in slightly more than one month what winthrop realty does or more appropriately did quoted text courtesy of google finance winthrop realty trust operated as a reit with several lines of business including direct property ownership joint ventures and loans in  the company adopted a plan of liquidation and ceased making new investments or acquisitions the company holds approximately  consolidated operating properties over  equity investments approximately four loans receivable one secured financing receivable and one loan security though the company once had a much larger portfolio of property loans and investments since making the decision to liquidate the company in  winthrops management has gradually retired the liabilities of the company in an orderly fashion with the companys bonds and preferred shares having been redeemed or retired and leaving a clean and much simplified balance sheet what are the remaining assets when examining the assets held by winthrop it becomes fairly apparent that shareholders are going to benefit significantly from reorganization or liquidation with properties located in illinois florida texas new york oklahoma and connecticut and across numerous asset classes including triple net commercial industrial multifamily and office the remaining winthrop portfolio can best be described as being unfocused this property portfolio is held both outright and through a system of numerous joint ventures additionally the company also owns several loans which represent a minority of the total assets held by the company in this case investors have the chance to profit from a sum of the parts valuation significantly exceeding the current market capitalization of the companys remaining assets most of the companys holdings are what one would describe as generic assets the price of which is fairly easily to determine based on market comparables and the income producing properties of the business however of the remaining assets in the portfolio there is one which is likely to be the most interesting to investors due to the potential for significant appreciation the companys  interest in  seventh avenue in the times square area of manhattan given the extremely high prices paid for real estate in the area over recent years this property could represent a significant wild card to the upside some simple math the numbers on winthrop going into final liquidation investors who take a quick glance at the companys recent history will find that winthrop has been liquidating assets for the past several quarters in order to redeem obligations and to pay several special dividends before converting to a liquidation trust with the final special dividend on the freely trading equity being declared earlier this month now as of june th the companys shares will trade for a little over one month before they are redeemed by the company and exchanged for units in a liquidating trust on august st  with a market capitalization currently standing at approximately  million against net assets held for liquidation reported in the most recent q at approximately  million investors stand to benefit significantly from a windup of the company subtracting the recent special dividend paid to investors of  or approximately  million from the  million figure current investors are entitled to receive proceeds of approximately  million less a  million management performance fee or approximately  per share from the liquidation of the remainder of winthrops assets for the sake of conservative investing lets call the final net return to the shareholder  from now on currently priced at  per share investors are purchasing  worth of assets net of all liabilities that are now in the process of being expeditiously liquidated should the remaining assets in the portfolio be completely liquidated in one year from the date of delisting investors are looking at an irr of approximately  should this liquidation take two years to consummate the irr profile stands at  and should it take  years the irr profile drops to  a figure which is still attractive in my opinion particularly if one were to think about this situation as a proxy for a short dated fixed income investment even if investors were to wait two years the opportunity for an attractive return to be realized with relatively little risk is compelling particularly given the fact that the management of the company has already engaged in significant marketing efforts for the portfolio of properties and is currently placing some under contract prior to the formation of a liquidating trust why invest now nimble investors benefit due to forced institutional selling through personal observation i have noticed that companies engaging in liquidation often experience periods of irrational pricing typically after paying a large distribution before the final liquidation event though companies that are liquidating often experience a shortterm increase in share price upon announcement of this decision the process is a long and time consuming one which causes many investors to disengage and move on to other opportunities several weeks or months after the initial announcement this phenomena also occurs when investors have received one or several special liquidation distributions and are already sitting on an attractive gain which helps to motivate their selling particularly as markets grow increasingly volatile another and much more significant source of selling in the near term will be from entities like index funds etfs and hedge funds which are often prohibited from making investments into liquidation situations or if they currently hold shares as part of a passive index of publicly traded securities they will be no longer allowed to retain their ownership past the august st deadline where shares are redeemed for nontransferable units in a liquidating trust this increasing supply of shares on the market has the potential to depress share prices in the near term creating a significant opportunity for investors to acquire shares at a more attractive price point i believe that current market volatility surrounding macroeconomic factors combined with forced selling of large institutions and investors that are otherwise restricted from holding illiquid assets will make this situation particularly attractive to investors who are willing to tolerate a period of illiquidity and i am optimistic that investors who monitor this situation on an active basis will have the chance to make an extremely attractive acquisition over the course of the next month as selling intensifies before the company delists itself risks a major area of risk is the fact that the companys asset base real estate is illiquid and that it could be difficult for the company to find a buyer for some or all of the portfolio at an appropriate price despite this fact there have been significant efforts on behalf of the management team to be expeditious in their liquidation efforts another risk is that the portfolio of assets held by winthrop could potentially lose significant value due to events such as a weakening commercial real estate markets in which their assets are located or rate hikes another source of risk is structural known as illiquidity risk once the companys shares cease trading investors will receive nontransferable units in a liquidation trust from which distributions will issue forth as the management of the company completes the sale of winthrops remaining real estate portfolio like all real estate transactions especially those on a large scale achieving maximum value can be a time consuming process which could take several years during this period of time investors will not be able to liquidate or otherwise transfer their ownership claim on the assets  investors are essentially receiving a bond with an indefinite maturity and a variable coupon that will mature in what will likely be  and at the most  years the duration risk of this situation is another source of significant risk for investors the irr profile for this investment could be significantly affected depending on the time frame in which the assets of the company are liquidated and the price investors end up paying before heading into liquidation a oneyear period of liquidation can represent a home run from an irr perspective while a threeyear liquidation turnaround period could simply be okay it is also important for investors to understand and appreciate that it is possible though not probable that it may take a longer period of time to liquidate these assets or the sums realized from the sale of the portfolio may not be as high as estimated it is extremely important for individuals to assess the tax implications in any special situation which are complicated while those in tax advantaged accounts are sheltered from this consideration it is important for those operating in a taxable environment to pay extremely close attention to the tax treatment of the assets received a discussion of the tax consequence of liquidation can be found addressed by the company here and it is important for investors with lingering doubts to consult with the proper advisors on this matter and to err on the side of caution conclusions know when to hold em though shunned by larger institutional investors and index funds due to structural factors situations of this nature have been always favored by value investors including ben graham and seth klarman i believe that for the right kind of investor winthrop realty trusts liquidation represents an attractive if not unconventional commitment to earn extremely attractive returns even when accounting for an illiquidity premium over the medium term despite market volatility real estate across almost all asset classes continues to trade at a rich multiple and interest rates remain low in the developed world making stabilized real estate an attractive investment for institutional money in this environment the management of winthrop has taken a prudent approach to maximizing value for shareholders while avoiding any attempts at empire building excessive risk or taking on dangerous levels of debt i believe that this outcome is one of the best for shareholders and has helped to narrow the gap between the market estimate of the companys value and the value which can be realized through a piecebypiece liquidation of the companys portfolio this last chance to purchase shares of winthrop on the open market and thus to be entitled to liquidating trust distributions represents a significant opportunity for investors with the patience and the willingness to wait for the checks to arrive in the mail hopefully sooner rather than later should the entire portfolio be liquidated within one year or less investors have the opportunity for a true if not unconventional home run investment should it take two or even three years to realize a complete portfolio liquidation investors will still have an attractive return profile to look forward to though already an attractive investment currently as time progresses towards the companys date of delisting the first week of august i would advise attentive investors to look increasingly closely at winthrops shares as here is a significant chance of more forced selling compounded by market volatility something which could further enhance the already attractive total return profile of the investment going forward disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a

this our twelfth letter to shareholders is somewhat bittersweet as it will be our last formal letter to shareholders the plan of liquidation continues apace if we include asset sales that occurred as well as those that are currently under contract we are nearing our goal of full liquidation at the end of  the company had interests in  assets which should be reduced to  if we are successful with our current marketing efforts before we become a liquidating trust to date sales proceeds from closed transactions have yielded approximately m as compared to an estimated range of net asset values for those assets of m to m on december   cash generated from sales has permitted the company to redeem its bonds and satisfy in full the liquidation distribution preference required to be paid with respect to our preferred shares since the adoption of the plan of liquidation we have distributed  in cash per common share among the assets currently under contract of sale are our warehouse in jacksonville florida our lake brandt apartment property in greensboro north carolina our facility in churchill pennsylvania net leased to westinghouse our luxury apartment property in stamford connecticut our interests in the sullivan center in chicago illinois and our one east erie multiuse office property in chicago illinois assuming the planned asset sales and capital transactions occur as scheduled the company could generate upwards of m in cash prior to commencement of the liquidating trust in august we intend to distribute as much of our cash as possible before commencement of the liquidating trust subject to maintaining appropriate reserves whether through luck or insight i will always take luck we do not believe we could have timed adoption of the plan of liquidation better while the world is still awash in liquidity headlines bespeak concern over excessive asset pricing the ten year treasury may currently be below  but real estate debt markets as well as other credit markets have seen widening spreads cmbs debt markets have experienced more than a  decline year over year in new originations since real estate debt is to real estate pricing as fuel to a fire asset pricing has begun to reflect this new reality that said we know our mission is to proceed as expeditiously as possible with the execution of our plan of liquidation it has been a fascinating twelve years in which management has benefitted from its association with the public capital markets and from your input we have learned much during this period any success which winthrop has enjoyed must be
