firm story institutional investors individual investors business continuity careers infrastructure real estate mlps  energy international closedend funds openend funds international equity strategy our new york citybased investment management team manages the international equity strategy our style is opportunistic with a bias towards quality and relative value and portfolios are constructed around the highest conviction ideas our experienced team and flat structure allow us to focus on process and performance we feel that our disciplined investment process combined with a pragmatic approach to capital markets is one of the keys to our success the strategy employs a topdown bottomup approach that integrates macroeconomic views with fundamental company research macroeconomic analysis is used to establish views on markets geographies and sectors which inform indepth fundamental research on each company we believe international developed markets offer compelling return and diversification potential international markets often trade at an attractive valuation relative to domestic markets and we seek to take advantage of these global inefficiencies we believe that valuation always matters during a market cycle we will hold value stocks and growth stocks but regardless feel that valuation must play some part in the analysis an investor can never completely ignore valuation conversely we never buy something just because it is cheap so valuation cannot be excluded nor be the sole driver we believe in a high conviction portfolio where our best ideas are not diluted we are not afraid to sell a name that is acting in a way that is detrimental to the strategy we operate at the intersection of discipline and flexibility and have found – with experience –
