plans announced for west line village  new rowhomes at sheridan station tod site   tweet west line village brings muchneeded housing to growing west colfax corridor lakewood colo – dirc homes and trailbreak partners announced their plans earlier this month for west line village a transit oriented development tod that includes  new rowhomes located at w th avenue and depew street in lakewood colorado adjacent to sheridan station the phased development will include nine distinctive floor plans ranging from  to  square feet including studios   and  bedroom homes  and  car garages as well as a front or back yards to enjoy the colorado sun west line village is named after rtd’s w line the  mile light rail line that runs between denver’s union station lakewood and golden the new community capitalizes access to multiple modes of transportation and easy connections between downtown denver and the west   “west line village brings muchneeded new housing to the west side of denver” said paul malone president of dirc homes “we are able to create a great sense of community since we have such a large site here we listened to today’s buyer in this area and they are looking to purchase new homes attainably priced with a high level of design with easy access to transit”   the stylish simplicity of west line village includes pitched roofs and the use of minimalist materials every home is streetfacing to provide a strong sense of community innovative streetscape design combines varied colors and textures and the landscaping for each home creates individuality within the neighborhood    buyers can enhance their homes with a range of upgrade options including balconies gas fireplaces hardwood floors appliance and finish upgrades and storage solutions    to execute the project dirc homes is leveraging its experience with urban infill new home construction by uniting with trailbreak partners a denverbased urban redevelopment firm and tod properties whose focus is transit close properties the group tagged rhap architecture  planning based in boulder co as the architect daniel rotner aia and ryan hanneman ncarb have over  years combined architectural experience undertaking commercial and residential neighborhood development new construction and remodels    “our idea is to create a community that leverages the metropolitan areas investment in mass transit” said doug elenowitz principal of trailbreak partners “whether you want to commute by bike train or bus the whole idea is to create a neighborhood where you are close to downtown have easy access in and out of town and really capitalize on the opportunity for thoughtful infill development”   the west colfax area is seeing dramatic changes along its western corridor major recent changes to this upandcoming area include the west line and sheridan station the st anthony’s redevelopment sloans improvements to the dry gulch area and many retail additions the population growth of denver and resulting traffic is at an alltime high so living west of i saves time getting out of town to the mountains residents are  stops to downtown denver  stops to golden   west line village broker jeff plous of one realty added “with inventory for homes in the secondary market and new construction market so low i’m excited to be a part of bringing this community to life being able to offer thoughtfully designed well built homes for prices that haven’t been seen in several years is exciting more and more of my clients are moving to denver and want to use light rail as their main mode of transportation west line village is the neighborhood so many buyers have been waiting for”   “we think west line village presents a terrific opportunity for buyers who have been unable to find opportunities in the market it features high design is well located and it’s a neighborhood not just a oneoff project most importantly we are able to deliver these homes at accessible prices the opportunity to own a new home at these prices without being in the suburbs is almost unheard of” said elenowitz   about dirc homes coming up on their fiveyear anniversary dirc homes llc is a full service residential development and home building company focusing on urban infill developments in the greater denver area the company offers a wide range of services including general contracting for
