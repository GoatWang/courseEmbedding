of debt securities generally will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement or other applicable offering materials registered global securities we may issue registered debt securities of a series in the form of one or more fully registered global securities we will deposit the registered global security with a depositary or with a nominee for a depositary identified in the prospectus supplement or other offering materials relating to such series the global security or global securities will represent and will be in a denomination or aggregate denominations equal to the portion of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding registered debt securities of the series to be represented by the registered global security or securities unless otherwise specified in the applicable prospectus supplement or other applicable offering materials unless it is exchanged in whole or in part for debt securities in definitive registered form a registered global security may not be transferred except as a whole in three cases        by the depositary for the registered global security to a nominee of the depositary        by a nominee of the depositary to the depositary or

relating to a series of debt securities will describe the specific terms of the depositary arrangement concerning any portion of that series of debt securities to be represented by a registered global security we anticipate that the following provisions will generally apply to all depositary arrangements upon the issuance of a registered global security the depositary will credit on its bookentry registration and transfer system the principal amounts of the debt securities represented by the registered global security to the accounts of persons that have accounts with the depositary these persons are referred to as participants any underwriters agents or debtors participating in the distribution of debt securities represented by the registered global security will designate the accounts to be credited only participants or persons that hold interests through participants will be able to beneficially own interests in a registered global security the depositary for a global security will maintain records of beneficial ownership interests in a registered global security for participants participants or persons that hold through participants will maintain records of beneficial ownership interests in a global security for persons other than participants these records will be the only means to transfer beneficial ownership in a registered global security the laws of some states may require that specified purchasers of securities take physical delivery of the securities in definitive form these laws may limit the ability of those persons to own transfer or pledge beneficial interests in global securities    table of contents so long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a registered global security the depositary or its nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the debt securities represented by the registered global security for all purposes under the indenture except as set forth below or in the applicable supplemental indenture owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security        may not have the debt securities represented by a registered global security registered in their names        will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities represented by a registered global security in definitive form and        will not be considered the owners or holders of debt securities represented by a registered global security under the indenture accordingly each person owning a beneficial interest in a registered global security must rely on the procedures of the depositary for the registered global security and if the person is not a participant on the procedures of the participant through which the person owns its interests to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture applicable to the registered global security payment of interest on and principal of registered global securities unless otherwise specified in the applicable

registered global security registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee to the depositary or its nominee as the registered owner of the registered global security none of the company the trustee or any paying agent for debt securities represented by a registered global security will have any responsibility or liability for        any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in such registered global security        maintaining supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership interests        the payments to beneficial owners of the global security of amounts paid to the depositary or its nominee or        any other matter relating to the actions and practices of the depositary its nominee or any of its participants generally a depositary upon receipt of any payment of principal premium interest on or additional amounts with respect to the global security will immediately credit participants accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their beneficial interests in the principal amount of a registered global security as shown on the depositarys records generally payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a registered global security held through participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices this is currently the case with the securities held for the accounts of customers registered in street name such payments will be the responsibility of participants exchange of registered global securities we may issue debt securities in definitive form in exchange for the registered global security if both of the following occur        the depositary for any debt securities represented by a registered global security is at any time unwilling or unable to continue as depositary or ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act and        we do not appoint a successor depositary within  days

agreements will not restrict our ability to merge or consolidate with or sell our assets to another entity or to engage in any other transactions if at any time we merge or consolidate with or sell our assets substantially as an entirety to another entity the successor entity will succeed to and assume our obligations under the unit agreements we will then be relieved of any further obligation under these agreements the unit agreements will not include any restrictions on our ability to put liens on our assets including our interests in our subsidiaries nor will they restrict our ability to sell our assets the unit agreements also will not provide for any events of default or remedies upon the occurrence of any events of default governing law the unit agreements and the units will be governed by new york law form exchange and transfer we will issue each unit in globalie bookentryform only units in bookentry form will be represented by a global security registered in the name of a depositary which will be the holder of all the units represented by the global security those who own beneficial interests in a unit will do so through participants in the depositarys system and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depositary and its participants information with respect to bookentry procedures if any will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement or other offering materials    table of contents each unit and all securities comprising the unit will be issued in the same form if we issue any units in registered nonglobal form the following will apply to them the units will be issued in the denominations stated in the applicable prospectus supplement holders may exchange their units for units of smaller denominations or combined into fewer units of larger denominations as long as the total amount is not changed        holders may exchange or transfer their units at the office of the unit agent holders may also replace lost stolen destroyed or mutilated units at that office we may appoint another entity to perform these functions or perform them ourselves        holders will not be required to pay a service charge to transfer or exchange their units but they may be required to pay for any tax or other governmental charge associated with the transfer or exchange the transfer or exchange and any replacement will be made only if our transfer agent is satisfied with the holders proof of legal ownership the transfer agent may also require an indemnity before replacing any units        if we have the right to redeem accelerate or settle any units before their maturity and we exercise our right as to less than all those units or other securities we may block the exchange or transfer of those units during the period beginning  days before the day we mail the notice of exercise and ending on the day of that mailing in order to freeze the list of holders to prepare the mailing we may also refuse to register transfers of or exchange any unit selected for early settlement except that we will continue to permit transfers and exchanges of the unsettled portion of any unit being partially settled we may also block the transfer or exchange of any unit in this manner if the unit includes securities that are or may be selected for early settlement only the depositary will be entitled to transfer or exchange a unit in global form since it will be the sole holder of the unit payments and notices in making payments and giving notices with respect to our units we will follow the procedures we plan to use with respect to our debt securities where applicable we describe those procedures above under description of debt securities    table of contents description of certain provisions of maryland law and eprs declaration of trust and bylaws we are organized as a maryland real estate investment trust the following is a summary of our declaration of trust and bylaws and several provisions of maryland law because the following is a summary it does not contain all the information that may be important to you if you want more information you should read our entire declaration of trust and bylaws copies of which we have previously filed with the sec or refer to the provisions of maryland law see where you can find more information for information about how to obtain copies of our declaration of trust and bylaws trustees our declaration of trust and bylaws provide that only our board of trustees will establish the number of trustees provided however that the term of office of a trustee will not be affected by any decrease in the number of trustees any vacancy on the board of trustees may be filled only by a majority of the remaining trustees even if the remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum or by the sole trustee any trustee elected to fill a vacancy will hold office until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until a successor is elected and qualified our declaration of trust divides our board of trustees into three classes shareholders elect the trustees of each class for threeyear terms upon the expiration of the current term of a respective class shareholders elect only one class of trustees each year we believe that classification of our board of trustees helps to assure the continuity of our business strategies and policies the classified board of trustees provision could have the effect of making the replacement of our incumbent trustees more time consuming and difficult at least two annual meetings of shareholders are generally required to effect a change in a majority of our board of trustees our declaration of trust provides that subject to any right of holders of one or more classes of preferred shares to elect or remove one or more trustees a trustee may be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least twothirds of our common shares entitled to be cast in the election of trustees this provision precludes shareholders from removing our incumbent trustees unless cause as defined in the declaration of trust exists and they can obtain a substantial affirmative vote of shares advance notice of trustee nominations and new business our bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election to our board of trustees and business to be transacted at shareholder meetings may be properly brought pursuant to our notice of the meeting by our board of trustees or by a shareholder who i is a shareholder of record at the time of giving the advance notice and at the time of the meeting ii is entitled to vote at the meeting and iii has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in our bylaws under our bylaws a shareholders notice of nominations for trustee or business to be transacted at an annual meeting of shareholders must be delivered to our secretary at our principal office not later than the close of business on the th day and not earlier than the close of business on the th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than  days or delayed by more than  days from the anniversary date of the preceding years annual meeting a shareholders notice must be delivered to us not earlier than the close of business on the th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the later of i the th day prior to such annual meeting or ii the th day following the day on which we first make a public announcement of the date of such meeting the public announcement of a postponement or of an adjournment of such annual meeting to a later date or time will not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholders notice if the number of trustees to be elected to our board of trustees is increased and we make no public announcement of such action at least  days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting a shareholders notice also will be considered    table of contents timely but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase if the notice is delivered to our secretary at our principal office not later than the close of business on the th day immediately following the day on which such public announcement is made for special meetings of shareholders our bylaws require a shareholder who is nominating a person for election to our board of trustees at a special meeting at which trustees are to be elected to give notice of such nomination to our secretary at our principal office not earlier than the close of business on the th day prior to such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of  the th day prior to such special meeting or  the th day following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the trustees to be elected at such meeting the public announcement of a postponement or adjournment of a special meeting to a later date or time will not commence a new time period for the giving of a shareholders notice as described above meetings of shareholders under our bylaws our annual meeting of shareholders will take place during the second quarter of each year following delivery of the annual report our chairman president or onethird of our trustees may call a special meeting of the shareholders our secretary also may call a special meeting of shareholders upon the written request of holders of at least a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting liability and indemnification of trustees and officers the laws relating to maryland real estate investment trusts the maryland reit law permit a real estate investment trust to indemnify and advance expenses to its trustees officers employees and agents to the same extent permitted by the maryland general corporation law the mgcl for directors and officers of maryland corporations the mgcl permits a corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and officers against judgments penalties fines settlements and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or are threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in those capacities however a maryland corporation is not permitted to provide this type of indemnification if the following is established        the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and was committed in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty        the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money property or services or        in the case of any criminal proceeding the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful additionally a maryland corporation may not indemnify a director or officer for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of that corporation or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses the mgcl permits a corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporations receipt of the following        a written affirmation by the director or officer of his good faith belief that he has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and        a written undertaking by him or on his behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately determined that this standard of conduct was not met our officers and trustees are and will be indemnified under our declaration of trust against certain liabilities our declaration of trust provides that we will to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law in effect from time to time indemnify a any individual who is a present or former trustee or officer of epr or b any individual who while a trustee or officer of epr and at the request of epr serves or has served as a director officer shareholder partner trustee employee or agent of any real estate investment trust corporation    table of contents partnership joint venture trust employee benefit plan or any other enterprises against any claim or liability together with reasonable expenses actually incurred in advance of a final disposition of a legal proceeding to which such person may become subject or which such person may incur by reason of his or her status as such we have the power with the approval of our board of trustees to provide such indemnification and advancement of expenses to a person who served a predecessor of epr in any of the capacities described in a or b above and to any employee or agent of epr or its predecessors we have also entered into indemnification agreements with our trustees and certain of our officers providing procedures for indemnification by us to the fullest extent permitted by law and advancements by us of certain expenses and costs relating to claims suits or proceedings arising from the respective trustees or officers service to us we have obtained trustees and officers liability insurance for the purpose of funding the provision of any such indemnification the sec has expressed the opinion that indemnification of trustees officers or persons otherwise controlling a company for liabilities arising under the securities act is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable shareholder liability under maryland law a shareholder is not personally liable for the obligations of a real estate investment trust solely as a result of his or her status as a shareholder despite this our legal counsel has advised us that in some jurisdictions the possibility exists that shareholders of a trust entity such as ours may be held liable for acts or obligations of the trust while we intend to conduct our business in a manner designed to minimize potential shareholder liability we can give no assurance that you can avoid liability in all instances in all jurisdictions our trustees have not provided in the past and do not intend to provide insurance covering these risks to our shareholders actions by shareholders by written consent our bylaws provide procedures governing actions by shareholders by written consent the bylaws specify that any written consents must be signed by shareholders entitled to cast a sufficient number of votes to approve the matter as required by statute our declaration of trust or our bylaws and such consent must be filed with minutes of the proceedings of the shareholders restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares our declaration of trust restricts the number of shares which may be owned by shareholders generally for us to qualify as a reit under the code not more than  in value of our outstanding shares may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals defined in the code to include certain entities and constructive ownership among specified family members at any time during the last half of a taxable year the shares also must be beneficially owned by  or more persons during at least  days of a taxable year or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year in order to maintain our qualification as a reit our declaration of trust contains restrictions on the acquisition of shares intended to ensure compliance with these requirements our declaration of trust generally provides that any person not just individuals holding more than  in number of shares or value of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our common shares or preferred shares the ownership limit may be subject to forfeiture of the shares including common shares and preferred shares owned in excess of the ownership limit we refer to the shares in excess of the ownership limit as excess shares the excess shares may be transferred to a trust for the benefit of one or more charitable beneficiaries the trustee of that trust would have the right to vote the voting excess shares and distributions on the excess shares would be payable to the trustee for the benefit of the charitable beneficiaries    table of contents holders of excess shares would be entitled to compensation for their excess shares but that compensation may be less than the price they paid for the excess shares persons who hold excess shares or who intend to acquire excess shares must provide written notice to us our ownership limit may also act to deter an unfriendly takeover of the company business combinations the mgcl contains a provision which regulates business combinations with interested shareholders this provision applies to maryland real estate investment trusts like us under the mgcl business combinations such as mergers consolidations share exchanges and the like between a maryland real estate investment trust and an interested shareholder or an affiliate of an interested shareholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the shareholder becomes an interested shareholder under the mgcl the following persons are deemed to be interested shareholders        any person who beneficially owns  or more of the voting power of the trusts shares or        an affiliate or associate of the trust who at any time within the twoyear period prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of  or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting shares of the trust after the fiveyear prohibition period has ended a business combination between a trust and an interested shareholder must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and must receive the following shareholder approvals        the affirmative vote of at least  of the votes entitled to be cast and        the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of shares other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom or with whose affiliate or associate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder the shareholder approvals discussed above are not required if the trusts shareholders receive the minimum price set forth in the mgcl for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its shares the foregoing provisions of the mgcl do not apply however to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the trust prior to the time that the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder a person is not an interested shareholder under the mgcl if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder the board of trustees may provide that its approval is subject to compliance with any terms and conditions determined by the board of trustees control share acquisitions the mgcl contains a provision which regulates control share acquisitions this provision also applies to maryland real estate investment trusts the mgcl provides that control shares of a maryland real estate investment trust acquired in a control share acquisition have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter shares owned by the acquiror by officers or by trustees who are employees of the trust are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter control shares are voting shares which if aggregated with all other shares owned by the acquiror or in respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy would entitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing trustees within one of the following ranges of voting power        onetenth or more but less than onethird        onethird or more but less than a majority or        a majority or more of all voting power    table of contents control shares do not include shares which the acquiring person is entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained shareholder approval a control share acquisition means the acquisition of control shares subject to certain exceptions a person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition may compel the board of trustees to call a special meeting of shareholders to be held within  days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares the right to compel the calling of a special meeting is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including an undertaking to pay the expenses of the meeting if no request for a meeting is made the trust may itself present the question at any shareholders meeting if voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the mgcl then the trust may redeem for fair value any or all of the control shares except those for which voting rights have previously been approved the right of the trust to redeem control shares is subject to conditions and limitations fair value is determined without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of shareholders at which the voting rights of the shares are considered and not approved if voting rights for control shares are approved at a shareholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote all other shareholders may exercise appraisal rights the fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition the control share acquisition statute of the mgcl does not apply to the following        shares acquired in a merger consolidation or share exchange if the trust is a party to the transaction or        acquisitions approved or exempted by a provision in the declaration of trust or bylaws of the trust adopted before the acquisition of shares antitakeover effect of maryland law and of our declaration of trust and bylaws the following provisions in our declaration of trust and bylaws and in maryland law could delay or prevent a change in control of epr        the limitation on ownership and acquisition of more than  of our shares        the classification of our board of trustees into classes and the election of each class for threeyear staggered terms        the requirement of cause and a twothirds majority vote of shareholders for

states us federal income tax considerations regarding epr and the acquisition ownership and disposition of our securities for purposes of this section entitled us federal income tax considerations references to we us and our mean only epr properties and not its subsidiaries or other lower tier entities except as otherwise indicated if we offer depositary shares warrants debt securities or units information about any additional income tax consequences to holders of those securities will be included in the prospectus supplement or other applicable offering materials under which those securities are offered this summary is based on current law is for general information only and is not tax advice the tax treatment to holders of our securities will vary depending on a holders particular situation this summary does not address all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to a holder of securities in light of his or her personal investments or tax circumstances moreover this summary does not address tax considerations applicable to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under the us federal income tax laws including without limitation        a bank life insurance company regulated investment company or other financial institution        brokerdealers or traders        partnerships and trusts        a person who acquires our securities in connection with employment or other performances of services        a person who holds our securities as part of a straddle hedging transaction constructive sale transaction constructive ownership transaction conversion transaction or other integrated investment        a person subject to the alternative minimum tax or        except as specifically described in the following summary a tax exempt entity or a foreign person in addition the summary below does not consider the effect of any foreign state local or other tax laws that may be applicable to holders of our securities the information in this section is based on the us internal revenue code the code current temporary and proposed treasury regulations promulgated under the code the legislative history of the code current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service the irs and court decisions all as of the date of this prospectus future legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations and practices and court decisions may change or adversely affect perhaps retroactively the tax considerations described herein we have not requested and do not plan to request any rulings from the irs concerning our tax treatment and the statements in this prospectus are not binding on the irs or any court thus we can provide no assurance that the tax considerations contained in this summary will not be challenged by the irs or sustained by a court if challenged by the irs this summary is based upon the assumption that the operation of the company and of its subsidiaries and other lowertier and affiliated entities will in each case be in accordance with its applicable organizational documents or partnership agreements this summary does not discuss the impact that us state and local taxes and taxes imposed by the nonus jurisdictions could have on the matters discussed in this summary in addition this summary assumes that security holders hold our common shares as a capital asset which generally means as property held for investment the us federal income tax treatment of holders of our common shares depends in some circumstances on determinations of fact and interpretation of complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available you are advised to consult your tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences to you of the acquisition ownership and sale of our securities and of our election to    table of contents be taxed as a reit including the us federal state local foreign and other tax consequences of such acquisition ownership sale and election and of potential changes in applicable tax laws taxation of the company general we elected to be taxed as a reit under sections  through  of the code commencing with our taxable year ended december   our reit election assuming continuing compliance with the then applicable qualification tests continues in effect for subsequent taxable years although no absolute assurance can be given we believe we have been organized and have operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a reit under the code commencing with our taxable year ended december   we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will meet the applicable requirements under us federal income tax laws which are highly technical and complex in the opinion of our counsel stinson leonard street llp we have qualified as a reit under the code for our  through  taxable years we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a reit and our current and proposed method of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the code for future taxable years this opinion is based upon certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters made by us including representations made by us in a representation letter and certificate provided by our officers and our factual representations set forth herein and in registration statements previously filed with the sec any variation from the factual statements set forth herein in registration statements previously filed with the sec or in the representation letter and certificate we have provided to our counsel may affect the conclusions upon which its opinion is based the opinions of stinson leonard street llp are based on existing law as contained in the code and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder in effect on the date of this prospectus and the interpretations of such provisions and treasury regulations by the irs and court decisions all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively and to possibly different interpretations our counsel will have no obligation to advise us or the holders of our securities of any subsequent change in the matters stated represented or assumed or of any subsequent change in the applicable law you should be aware that the opinions expressed are not binding upon the irs or any court accordingly there can be no assurance that contrary positions may not successfully be asserted by the irs moreover our qualification and taxation as a reit depends upon our ability through actual annual operating results and methods of operation to satisfy various qualification tests imposed under the code such as distributions to shareholders asset composition levels and diversity of stock ownership the actual results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by our counsel in addition our ability to qualify as a reit also depends in part upon the operating results organizational structure and entity classification for us federal income tax purposes of certain affiliated entities including affiliates that have made elections to be taxed as reits and for whom the actual results of the various reit qualification tests have not been and will not be reviewed by our counsel accordingly no assurance can be given that the actual results of our operations for any particular taxable year will satisfy such requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit if we qualify for taxation as a reit we generally will not be subject to us federal corporate income taxes on our taxable income that is distributed currently to our shareholders this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation once at the corporate level when earned and once again at the shareholders level when distributed that generally results from investment in an ordinary subchapter c corporation    table of contents any distributions to our shareholders will be included in their income as dividends to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits generally our dividends are not treated as qualified dividend income subject to a favorable  or  rate no portion of any of our dividends is eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits generally are treated for us federal income tax purposes as return of capital to the extent of and in reduction of a shareholders basis in our shares our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally allocated first to distributions made on our preferred shares if any and thereafter to distributions made on our common shares for all of these purposes our distributions include cash distributions and any in kind distributions of property that we might make if we qualify as a reit we will however be subject to us federal income tax in the following circumstances        we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on any undistributed reit taxable income including undistributed net capital gains        we may be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference under certain circumstances        if we have a net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property defined generally as property we acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan secured by the property or a lease of the property which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or b other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property we will be subject to tax at the highest us federal corporate income tax rate currently  on this income        we will be subject to a  tax on any net income from prohibited transactions which are in general certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property included in our inventory or held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business        we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net longterm capital gain in that case a us shareholder would be taxed on its proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gain to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the shareholder and would receive a credit or refund for its proportionate share of the tax we paid        if we fail to satisfy the  or  gross income tests as discussed below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements we will be subject to a  tax on an amount equal to a the gross income attributable to the greater of the amounts by which we fail the  or  gross income tests multiplied by b a fraction intended to reflect our profitability        if we fail to distribute for any calendar year at least the sum of a  of our reit ordinary income for the year b  of our reit capital gain net income for the year other than certain longterm capital gains for which we make a capital gains designation described below and on which we pay the tax and c any undistributed taxable income from prior periods we would be subject to a  excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of a the amounts actually distributed plus b retained amounts on which income is paid at the corporate level        if we acquire any asset from a corporation which is or has been a subchapter c corporation in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of the subchapter c corporation and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the applicable recognition period set forth in section  of the code currently a fiveyear period for the taxable year beginning in  beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset then we will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on the excess of a the fair market value of the asset over b our adjusted basis in the asset in each case determined as of the date we acquired the asset the results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain assume that we will not make an election pursuant to existing treasury regulations to recognize such gain at the time we acquire the asset    table of contents      we will be required to pay a  tax on any redetermined rents redetermined deductions or excess interest in general redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours redetermined deductions and excess interest generally represent amounts that are deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on armslength negotiations any taxable reit subsidiary is separately taxed on its net income as a c corporation        if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests as described below by more than a de minimis amount due to reasonable cause and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of  for each taxable year in which we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets that caused us to fail such test for the period from the start of such failure until the failure is resolved or the assets that caused the failure are disposed of        if we invest in properties in foreign countries or other jurisdictions our income from those properties will generally be subject to tax there then we will distribute the required percentages of our taxable income to our shareholders for any such year and we will generally not pay us federal income tax as a result we cannot recover the cost of foreign income taxes imposed on our foreign investments by claiming foreign tax credits against our us federal income tax liability also we cannot pass any foreign tax credits through to our shareholders        if we fail to satisfy any provision of the code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income tests or certain violations of the asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of  for each such failure        we may be required to pay monetary penalties to the irs in certain circumstances including if we fail to meet record keeping requirements intended to monitor our compliance with rules relating to the composition of a reits shareholders as described below in requirements for qualification as a reit        a  tax may be imposed with respect to certain items of income and expense that are directly or constructively paid between a reit and a trs if and to the extent that the irs establishes that such items were not based on market rates        certain of our subsidiaries that are subchapter c corporations including any trss as defined below will be subject to federal corporate income tax on their earnings if we fail to qualify or elect not to qualify as a reit we will be subject to us federal income tax in the same manner as a c corporation distributions to our shareholders if we do not qualify as a reit will not be deductible by us nor will distributions be required under the code in that event distributions to our shareholders will generally be taxable as ordinary dividends potentially eligible for the  or  income tax rate depending on whether the shareholder is in the  marginal us federal income tax bracket discussed below in taxation of taxable us shareholders and subject to limitations in the code will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders also we will generally be disqualified from qualification as a reit for the four taxable years following disqualification if we do not qualify as a reit for even one year this could result in reduction or elimination of distributions to our shareholders or in our incurring substantial indebtedness or liquidating substantial investments in order to pay the resulting corporatelevel taxes the code provides certain relief provisions under which we might avoid automatically ceasing to be a reit for failure to meet certain reit requirements all as discussed in more detail below    table of contents requirements for qualification as a reit the code defines a reit as a corporation trust or association that elects to be a reit or has made such election for a previous year and satisfies the applicable filing and administrative requirements to maintain qualification as a reit and      that is managed by one or more trustees or directors      the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or transferable certificates      that would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for sections  through  of the code      that is neither a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of certain provisions of the code      the beneficial ownership of which is held by  or more persons      not more than  in value of the outstanding shares of which is owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year and      that meets certain other tests described below regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions the corporation trust or association must elect to be a reit or have made such election for a previous year and satisfy the applicable filing and administrative requirements to maintain qualification as a reit the code provides that conditions  through  inclusive must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition  must be met during at least  days of a taxable year of  months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than  months conditions  and  do not apply until after the first taxable year for which an election is made to be taxed as a reit for purposes of condition  pension funds and certain other taxexempt entities are treated as individuals subject to a lookthrough exception with respect to pension funds a reit also must report its income for us federal income tax purposes based on a calendar year accounting period we have adopted december  as our year end and thereby satisfy this requirement to monitor continuing compliance with the share ownership requirements described in  and  above we are generally required to maintain records regarding the actual ownership of our shares to do so we must demand written statements each year from the record holders of significant percentages of our stock in which the record holders are to disclose the actual owners of the shares ie the persons required to include in gross income the dividends paid by us a list of those persons failing or refusing to comply with this demand must be maintained as part of our records failure to comply with these record keeping requirements could subject us to monetary penalties a shareholder that fails or refuses to comply with the demand is required by treasury regulations to submit a statement with its tax return disclosing the actual ownership of the shares and other information we believe that we have satisfied each of the above conditions in addition our declaration of trust provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares to prevent further concentration of share ownership as summarized in description of certain provisions of maryland law and eprs declaration of trust and bylaws these restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in  and  above these restrictions however may not ensure that we will in all cases be able to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in  and  above in general if we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements our status as a reit will terminate however if we comply with the rules in applicable treasury regulations that require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that we failed to meet the requirement described in condition  above we will be treated as having met this requirement    table of contents ownership of interests in partnerships and limited liability companies we own and operate one or more properties through partnerships and limited liability companies in the case of a reit which is a partner in a partnership or a member in a limited liability company treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes treasury regulations provide that the reit will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company based on its interest in partnership capital subject to special rules relating to the  reit asset test described below also the reit will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of the income of that entity the assets and items of gross income of the partnership or limited liability company retain the same character in our hands for purposes of section  of the code including satisfying the gross income tests and the asset tests thus our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of partnerships and limited liability companies taxed as partnerships in which we are directly or indirectly through other partnerships or limited liability companies taxed as partnerships a partner or member are treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the reit qualification requirements described in this prospectus including the income and asset tests described below ownership of interests in qualified reit and other disregarded subsidiaries we own  of the stock of a number of corporate subsidiaries that are qualified reit subsidiaries each a qrs and may acquire stock of one or more new subsidiaries a corporation qualifies as a qrs if  of its outstanding stock is held by us and we do not elect to treat the corporation as a taxable reit subsidiary as described below a qrs is generally disregarded for us federal income tax purposes and all assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of a qrs are treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit for all purposes of the code including the reit qualification tests other entities that are wholly owned by us including single member limited liability companies that have not elected to be taxed as corporations for us federal income tax purposes are also generally disregarded as separate entities for us federal income tax purposes including for purposes of the reit income and asset tests for this reason in applying the us federal income tax requirements described in this summary references to our income and assets include the income and assets of any qrs or other disregarded subsidiary a qrs is not subject to us federal income tax and our ownership of the voting stock of a qrs is ignored for purposes of determining our compliance with the ownership limits described below in asset tests ownership of interests in taxable reit subsidiaries a taxable reit subsidiary trs is a corporation other than a reit in which a reit directly or indirectly holds stock and that has made a joint election with the reit to be treated as a trs a trs also includes any corporation other than a reit with respect to which a trs owns securities possessing more than  of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of such corporation other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities a trs generally may engage in any business including the provision of customary or noncustomary services to tenants of its parent reit we own several corporate subsidiaries that have elected trs status and may acquire interests in additional trss in the future a trs is subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates currently a maximum rate of  and also may be subject to state and local taxation we are not treated as holding the assets of a trs or other taxable subsidiary corporation or as receiving any income that the subsidiary earns rather the stock issued by a taxable subsidiary to us is an asset in our hands and we treat the dividends paid to us from such taxable subsidiary if any as income this treatment can affect our income and asset test calculations as described below because we do not include the assets and income of trss or other taxable subsidiary corporations in determining our compliance with the reit requirements we may use such entities to undertake indirectly activities that the reit rules might otherwise preclude us from doing directly or through passthrough subsidiaries for example we may use trss or other taxable subsidiary corporations to conduct activities that give rise to certain categories of income such as management fees or to conduct activities that if conducted by us directly could be treated in our hands as prohibited transactions    table of contents in addition the earnings stripping rules of the code limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs and its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation accordingly if we lend money to a trs the trs may be unable to deduct all or a part of the interest paid on that loan and the lack of an interest deduction could result in a material increase in the amount of tax paid by the trs further as discussed below under penalty tax the rules impose a  excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit or the reits operations that are not conducted on an armslength basis any dividends paid or deemed paid by any one of the companys trss will be taxable to the companys shareholders to the extent the dividends received from the trs are paid to the companys shareholders the company may own more than  of the stock of a trs without jeopardizing its qualification as a reit however as noted below in order for the company to qualify as a reit the securities of all of the trss in which it has invested either directly or indirectly may not represent more than  of the total value of its assets the company expects that the aggregate value of all of its interests in trss will represent less than  of the total value or its assets however the company cannot assure that this will always be true in addition a trs may be prevented from deducting interest on debt funded directly or indirectly by its parent reit if certain tests regarding the trss debt to equity ratio and interest expense are not satisfied a reits ownership of securities of a trs will not be subject to the  or  asset tests described below and its operations will be subject to the provisions described above further the trs rules impose a  excise tax on transactions between a trs and its parent reit or the reits tenants that are not conducted on an armslength basis such as any redetermined rents redetermined deductions excess interest or redetermined trs service income in general redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by a trs of ours redetermined deductions and excess interest represent any amounts that are deducted by a trs of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on armslength negotiations and redetermined trs service income is income of a trs that is understated as a result of services provided to us or on our behalf rents we receive will not constitute redetermined rents if they qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the code we intend to scrutinize all of our transactions with our trss and to conduct such transactions on an armslength basis however we cannot assure you that we will be successful in avoiding this excise tax asset tests at the close of each quarter of our taxable year we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets first at least  of the value of our total assets including assets held by our qrss and our allocable share of the assets held by the partnerships and other entities treated as partnerships under the code in which we own an interest must be represented by  interests in real property  interests in mortgages on real property such as land buildings leasehold interests in real property and personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property for which the rent attributable to the personal property is not greater than  of the total rent received under the lease  shares or transferable certificates of beneficial interest in other reits  cash  cash items including receivables arising in the ordinary course of the reits business and  government securities as well as certain temporary investments in stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of new capital raised by epr for the oneyear period beginning on the date of receipt of such new capital second not more than  of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those securities includable in the  asset test third of the investments included in the  asset class and except for certain investments in other reits a qrs or a trs the value of any one issuers securities may not exceed  of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than  of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer except in the case of the  value test securities satisfying the straight debt safeharbor certain types of securities    table of contents we may own are disregarded as securities solely for purposes of the  value test including but not limited to any loan to an individual or an estate any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security issued by a reit in addition solely for purposes of the  value test the determination of our interest in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company excluding for this purpose certain securities described in the code fourth for taxable years beginning on or after january   no more than   for taxable years beginning on or after january   and ending on or before december   of the value of our assets may be comprised of securities of one or more trss the asset tests described above must be satisfied at the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values if we fail to satisfy an asset test because we acquire securities or other property during a quarter we can cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets within  days after the close of that quarter we believe we have maintained and intend to continue to maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset tests if we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests within the  day cure period we would cease to qualify as a reit unless we are eligible for certain relief provisions discussed below certain relief provisions may be available to us if we fail to satisfy the asset tests described above after the  day cure period under these provisions we will be deemed to have met the  and  reit asset tests if i the value of our nonqualifying assets does not exceed the lesser of a  of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or b  and ii we dispose of the nonqualifying assets or otherwise satisfy such tests within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or the period of time prescribed by treasury regulations for a failure that exceeds the de minimis thresholds described above that is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests after the  day cure period by taking steps including i the disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets or the taking other actions which allow us to meet the asset test within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or the period of time prescribed by treasury regulations ii paying a tax equal to the greater of a  or b the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets and iii filing a schedule describing each asset that caused the failure in accordance with applicable treasury regulations although we believe that we have satisfied the asset tests described above and plan to take steps to ensure that we satisfy such tests for any quarter end there can be no assurance we always will be successful if we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests in a timely manner and the relief provisions described above are not available we would cease to qualify as a reit gross income tests we must satisfy two gross income requirements for each taxable year to maintain our qualification as a reit first in each taxable year at least  of our gross income must be qualifying income qualifying income generally includes i rents from real property except as modified below ii interest on obligations collateralized by mortgages on or interests in real property and real estate mortgages other than gain from property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business dealer property iii dividends or other distributions on shares in other reits as well as gain from the sale of those shares iv abatements and refunds of real property taxes v income from the operation and gain from the sale of property acquired at or in lieu of a foreclosure of the mortgage collateralized by such property foreclosure property vi commitment fees received for agreeing to make loans collateralized by mortgages on real property or to purchase or lease real property vii qualified temporary investment income and viii gain from the sale or other disposition of a real estate asset which is not a prohibited transaction second in each taxable    table of contents year at least  of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions must be derived directly or indirectly from income from the real property investments described above or dividends interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities or from any combination of the foregoing interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the  gross income test as described above to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property if we receive interest income with respect to a mortgage loan that is secured by both real property and other property and the highest principal amount of the loan outstanding during a taxable year exceeds the fair market value of the real property on the date that we acquired or originated the mortgage loan the interest income will be apportioned between the real property and the other collateral and our income from the arrangement will qualify for purposes of the  gross income test only to the extent that the interest is allocable to the real property even if a loan is not secured by real property or is undersecured the income that it generates may nonetheless qualify for purposes of the  gross income test rents we receive will qualify as rents from real property for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a reit described above only if all of the following conditions are met        the amount of rent must not be based in any way on the income or profits of any person although rents generally will not be excluded solely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of gross receipts or gross sales        we or an actual or constructive owner of  or more of our capital shares must not actually or constructively own  or more of the interests in the tenant or if the tenant is a corporation  or more of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the tenant rents received from any such tenant that is our trs however will not be excluded from the definition of rents from real property as a result of this condition if at least  of the space at the property to which the rents relate is leased to third parties and the rents paid by the trs are comparable to rents paid by our other tenants for comparable space whether rents paid by a trs are substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants is determined at the time the lease with the trs is entered into extended and modified if such modification increases the rents due under such lease notwithstanding the foregoing however if a lease with a controlled taxable reit subsidiary is modified and such modification results in an increase in the rents payable by such trs any such increase will not qualify as rents from real property for purposes of this rule a controlled taxable reit subsidiary is a trs in which we own stock possessing more than  of the voting power or more than  of the total value of outstanding stock of such trs in addition rents we receive from a tenant that also is our trs will not be excluded from the definition of rents from real property as a result of our ownership interest in the trs if the property to which the rents relate is a qualified lodging facility or on or after january   a qualified healthcare property and such property is operated on behalf of the trs by a person who is an independent contractor and certain other requirements are met our trss will be subject to us federal income tax on their income from the operation of these properties        rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property must not be greater than  of the total rent received under the lease if this condition is not met then the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not qualify as rents from real property we currently have several leases that generate nonqualifying rent from personal property but such amounts are not material in relation to our gross income        the reit generally must not operate or manage the property for which the rents are received or furnish or render services to the tenants of the property subject to a  de minimis exception other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit derives no revenue or through a trs the reit may however directly perform certain services that are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property any amounts we receive from a trs with respect to the trss provision of noncustomary services will be nonqualifying income under the  gross income test and except to the extent received through the payment of dividends the  gross income test    table of contents we do not intend to charge rent for any property that is based in whole or in part on the net income or profits of any person except by reason of being based on a percentage of gross receipts or sales as described above and generally we do not intend to rent any personal property other than in connection with a lease of real property where either less than  of the total rent is attributable to personal property or an amount immaterial to our operations is attributable to personal property currently we do have several leases in which the rent attributable to personal property may exceed the  limitation based on the original respective fair market values of the real property and personal property at the time the lease was executed we directly perform services under certain of our leases but such services are not rendered to the occupant of the property furthermore these services are usual and customary management services provided by landlords renting space for occupancy in the geographic areas in which we own property to the extent that the performance of any services provided by us would cause amounts received from our tenants to be excluded from rents from real property we intend to hire a trs or an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue to perform such services the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued directly or indirectly if the determination of some or all of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person however an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales from time to time we may enter into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps caps and floors options to purchase these items and futures and forward contracts income from a hedging transaction including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction that is clearly identified as a hedging transaction as specified in the code will not constitute gross income and thus will be exempt from the  gross income test to the extent such a hedging transaction is entered into on or after january   and from the  gross income test to the extent such hedging transaction is entered into after july   the term hedging transaction as used above generally means any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of  interest rate changes or fluctuations with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets or  for hedging transactions entered into after july   currency fluctuations with respect to an item of qualifying income under the  or  gross income test to the extent that we do not properly identify such transactions as hedges we hedge other risks or we hedge with other types of financial instruments the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests we intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a reit we have made investments in properties located in canada these investments could cause us to incur foreign currency gains or losses prior to july   the characterization of any such foreign currency gains for purposes of the gross income tests was unclear though the irs had indicated that reits may apply the principles of proposed treasury regulations to determine whether such foreign currency gain constitutes qualifying income under the gross income tests as a result we anticipate that any foreign currency gain we recognized relating to rents we receive from our properties located in canada was qualifying income for purposes of the  and  gross income tests any foreign currency gains recognized after july   to the extent attributable to specific items of qualifying income or gain or specific qualifying assets however generally will not constitute gross income for purposes of the  and  gross income tests and therefore will be exempt from these tests dividends we receive from our taxable reit subsidiaries will qualify under the  but not the  gross income test the department of treasury has the authority to determine whether any item of income or gain recognized after july   which does not otherwise qualify under the  or  gross income tests may be excluded as gross income for purposes of such tests or may be considered income that qualifies under either such test    table of contents if we fail to satisfy one or both of the  or  gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we generally may make use of the relief provisions if        our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect        we attach a schedule of the sources of our income to our us federal income tax return and        any incorrect information on the schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax if this relief provision is available we would remain subject to tax equal to the greater of the amount by which we failed the  gross income test or the  gross income test as applicable multiplied by a fraction intended to reflect our profitability it is not possible however to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions for example if we fail to satisfy the gross income tests because nonqualifying income that we intentionally accrue or receive exceeds the limits on nonqualifying income the irs could conclude that our failure to satisfy the tests was not due to reasonable cause if these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances we will not qualify as a reit as discussed above even if these relief provisions apply and we retain our status as a reit a tax would be imposed with respect to our nonqualifying income we may not always be able to comply with the gross income tests for reit qualification despite periodic monitoring of our income prohibited transaction income any gain we realize on the sale of any property other than foreclosure property held as inventory or otherwise primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a  penalty tax whether property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction we intend to engage in the business of acquiring developing and owning our properties for investment with a view to longterm appreciation we have made and may in the future make occasional sales of the properties consistent with our investment objectives we do not intend to engage in prohibited transactions the irs may contend however that one or more of these sales is subject to the  penalty tax foreclosure property foreclosure property is real property and any personal property incident to such real property  that we acquire as the result of having bid in the property at foreclosure or having otherwise reduced the property to ownership or possession by agreement or process of law after a default or upon imminent default on a lease of the property or a mortgage loan held by us and secured by the property  for which we acquired the related loan or lease at a time when default was not imminent or anticipated and  with respect to which we made a proper election to treat the property as foreclosure property we generally will be subject to tax at the maximum corporate rate currently  on any net income from foreclosure property including any gain from the disposition of the foreclosure property other than income that constitutes qualifying income for purposes of the  gross income test any gain from the sale of property for which a foreclosure property election has been made will not be subject to the  tax on gains from prohibited transactions described above even if the property would otherwise constitute inventory or dealer property to the extent that we receive any income from foreclosure property that does not qualify for purposes of the  gross income test we intend to make an election to treat the related property as foreclosure property    table of contents penalty tax any redetermined rents redetermined deductions or excess interest we generate will be subject to a  penalty tax in general redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by one of our trss and redetermined deductions and excess interest generally represent any amounts that are deducted by a trs for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on armslength negotiations rents we receive will not constitute redetermined rents if they qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the code we believe that all fees paid to our trss for tenant services are at armslength rates although the fees may not satisfy the safe harbor provisions referenced above these determinations are inherently factual and the irs has broad discretion to assert that amounts paid between related parties should be reallocated to clearly reflect their respective incomes if the irs successfully makes such an assertion we would be required to pay a  penalty tax on the excess of an armslength fee for tenant services over the amount actually paid annual distribution requirements to maintain our qualification as a reit we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to     a the sum of     i  of our reit taxable income computed before deductions for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain and     ii  of our net income after tax if any from foreclosure property minus     b the excess of the sum of certain items of noncash income ie income attributable to leveled stepped rents original issue discount on purchase money debt or a likekind exchange that is later determined to be taxable over  of reit taxable income as described above in addition if we dispose of any asset we acquired from a corporation which is or has been a subchapter c corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of that subchapter c corporation within the ten year period following our acquisition of such asset we would be required to distribute at least  of the aftertax built in gain if any we recognized on the disposition of the asset we must pay the distributions described above in the taxable year to which they relate current distributions or at our election in the following taxable year if they are either i declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration provided such payment is made during the twelve months following the close of such year throwback distributions or ii paid during january to shareholders of record in october november or december of the prior year deemed current distributions to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least  but less than  of our reit taxable income as adjusted we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates in addition we would be subject to a  excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year or in the case of distributions with declaration and record dates falling in the last three months of the calendar year by the end of january immediately following such year at least the sum of  of our reit ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain income for the year other than certain longterm capital gains for which we make a capital gains designation and on which we pay the tax and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods any reit taxable income and net capital gain on which a reitlevel corporate income tax is imposed for any year is treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of calculating the excise tax    table of contents we believe we have made and intend to continue to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements we generally expect that our reit taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of the allowance of depreciation and other noncash charges included in computing reit taxable income accordingly we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above however from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements because of timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income in addition we may decide to retain our cash rather than distribute it in order to repay debt or for other reasons further it is possible that from time to time we may be allocated a share of net capital gain attributable to any depreciated property we sell that exceeds our allocable share of cash attributable to that sale if these circumstances occur we may need to arrange for borrowings or may need to pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirements under certain circumstances we may be able to rectify an inadvertent failure due to for example an irs adjustment such as an increase in our taxable income or a reduction in reported expenses to meet the  distribution requirement for a year by paying deficiency dividends to shareholders in a later year which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year thus we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends subject to the  excise tax described below however we will be required to pay interest to the irs based on the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividends failure to qualify certain cure provisions may be available to us in the event that we discover a violation of a provision of the code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit except with respect to violations of the gross income tests and assets tests for which the cure provisions are described above and provided the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect these cure provisions generally impose a  penalty for each violation in lieu of a loss of reit status if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions do not apply we will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates distributions to shareholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us and we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our shareholders as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our shareholders in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to shareholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and subject to certain limitations of the code corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification as a result our failure to qualify as a reit would likely reduce the cash available for distribution to our shareholders in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit all distributions to our shareholders will be taxable as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earning and profits in this event subject to certain limitations under the code corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction and individual distributees may be eligible for preferential rates if any on any qualified dividend income it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief taxation of taxable us shareholders the following summary describes certain us federal income tax consequences to us shareholders with respect to an investment in our shares this discussion does not address the tax consequences to persons who receive special treatment under the us federal income tax law shareholders subject to special treatment include without limitation insurance companies financial institutions or brokerdealers taxexempt organizations shareholders holding securities as part of a conversion transaction or a hedge or hedging    table of contents transaction or as a position in a straddle for tax purposes foreign corporations or partnerships and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states if you are a us shareholder as defined below this section or the section entitled taxation of taxexempt shareholders applies to you otherwise the section entitled taxation of nonus shareholders applies to you as used herein the term us shareholders means a holder of shares who for us federal income tax purposes is        a citizen or resident of the united states        a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof unless in the case of a partnership treasury regulations provide otherwise        an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or        a trust that is subject to the primary supervision of a us court and which has one or more us persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a us person distributions generally as long as we qualify as a reit distributions made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends generally will constitute dividends taxable to our us shareholders as ordinary income when actually or constructively received for purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of shares are out of current or accumulated earnings and profits our earnings and profits will be allocated first to our outstanding preferred shares and then to our common shares these distributions will not be eligible for the dividendsreceived deduction in the case of us shareholders that are corporations because we generally are not subject to us federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income distributed to our shareholders our ordinary dividends generally are not qualified dividend income eligible for the reduced  or  rates depending on whether the marginal us federal income tax rate is less than  or is  available to most noncorporate taxpayers under the american taxpayer relief act of  and will continue to be taxed at the higher tax rates applicable to ordinary income however the reduced  or  rate does apply to our distributions        designated as longterm capital gain dividends except to the extent attributable to real estate depreciation in which case such distributions continue to be subject to tax at a  rate        to the extent attributable to dividends received by us from nonreit corporations or other taxable reit subsidiaries and        to the extent attributable to income upon which we have paid corporate income tax for example if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior year it is not likely that a significant amount of our dividends paid to individual us shareholders will constitute qualified dividend income eligible for the current reduced tax rates of  or  to the extent that we make distributions not designated as capital gain dividends in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits these distributions will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to each us shareholder this treatment will reduce the adjusted basis which each us shareholder has in his or her shares of stock for tax purposes by the amount of the distribution but not below zero distributions in excess of a us shareholders adjusted

table of contents more than one year dividends we declare in october november or december of any year and payable to a shareholder of record on a specified date in any of these months shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the shareholders on december  of that year provided we actually pay the dividend on or before january  of the following calendar year us shareholders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses certain stock dividends including dividends partially paid in our common shares and partially paid in cash that comply with recent irs guidance will be taxable to recipient us shareholders to the same extent as if paid in cash see taxation of the companyannual distribution requirements above capital gain distributions distributions that we properly designate as capital gain dividends and undistributed amounts for which we properly make a capital gains designation will be taxable to us shareholders as gains to the extent that they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year from the sale or disposition of a capital asset depending on the period of time we have held the assets which produced these gains and on certain designations if any which we may make these gains may be taxable to noncorporate us shareholders at a    or  rate depending on the nature of the asset giving rise to the gain and the shareholders marginal federal income tax rate corporate us shareholders may however be required to treat up to  of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income passive activity losses and investment interest limitations distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a us shareholder of our shares will be treated as portfolio income as a result us shareholders generally will not be able to apply any passive losses against this income or gain a us shareholder may elect to treat capital gain dividends capital gains from the disposition of stock and qualified dividend income as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation but in such case the shareholders will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amounts other distributions we make to the extent they do not constitute a return of capital generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation gain arising from the sale or other disposition of our shares however will not be treated as investment income under certain circumstances retention of net longterm capital gains we may elect to retain rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend our net longterm capital gains if we make this election a capital gains designation we would pay tax on our retained net longterm capital gains in addition to the extent we make a capital gains designation a us shareholder generally would        include its proportionate share of our undistributed longterm capital gains in computing its longterm capital gains in its return for its taxable year in which the last day of our taxable year falls subject to certain limitations as to the amount that is includable        be deemed to have paid the capital gains tax imposed on us on the designated amounts included in the us shareholders longterm capital gains        receive a credit or refund for the amount of tax deemed paid by it        increase the adjusted basis of its shares by the difference between the amount of includable gains and the tax deemed to have been paid by it and        in the case of a us shareholder that is a corporation appropriately adjust its earnings and profits for the retained capital gains in accordance with treasury regulations to be promulgated    table of contents dispositions of shares generally if you are a us shareholder and you sell or dispose of your shares you will recognize gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between i the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property you receive on the sale or other disposition and ii your adjusted basis in the shares for tax purposes this gain or loss will be capital in nature if you have held the shares as a capital asset and will be longterm capital gain or loss if you have held the shares for more than one year and will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates up to  if the shares are held for one year or less however if you are a us shareholder and you recognize loss upon the sale or other disposition of shares that you have held for six months or less after applying certain holding period rules the loss you recognize will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent you received distributions from us or which were retained by us and which were required to be treated as longterm capital gains the maximum tax rate for individual taxpayers on net longterm capital gains ie the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss is currently  or  depending on whether the shareholder is in the  marginal us federal income tax bracket for most assets in the case of individuals whose ordinary income is taxed at a  or  rate the  rate is reduced to  if an investor recognizes a loss upon a subsequent disposition of our shares or other securities in an amount that exceeds a prescribed threshold it is possible that the provisions of treasury regulations involving reportable transactions could apply with a resulting requirement to separately disclose the lossgenerating transaction to the irs these regulations though directed towards tax shelters are broadly written and apply to transactions that would not typically be considered tax shelters the code imposes significant penalties for failure to comply with these requirements you should consult your tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligation with respect to the receipt or disposition of our shares or securities or transactions that we might undertake directly or indirectly moreover you should be aware that we and other participants in the transactions in which we are involved including their advisors might be subject to disclosure or other requirements pursuant to these regulations redemption of shares if we redeem any of our shares held by you the tax treatment of the redemption must be determined based on facts at the time of redemption in general you will recognize gain or loss as opposed to dividend income equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption results in a complete termination of your interest in all classes of our equity securities is a substantially disproportionate redemption or is not essentially equivalent to a dividend within the meaning of section b of the code with respect to you in applying these tests you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities you also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you under the code if as a result of a redemption by us of your shares you no longer own either actually or constructively any of our equity securities or only own actually and constructively an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities then it is likely that the redemption of your shares would be considered not essentially equivalent to a dividend and thus would result in gain or loss to you gain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is taxed at a maximum longterm capital gain rate of  or  depending on whether the shareholder is in the  marginal us federal income tax bracket in the case of individuals whose ordinary income is taxed at a  or  rate the  rate is reduced to  however whether a distribution is not essentially equivalent to a dividend depends on all of the facts and circumstances and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to your situation    table of contents generally if the redemption does not meet the tests described above then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits the amount of the dividend will be the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received if the redemption is taxed as a dividend your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shares in us that you own if you own no other shares in us under certain circumstances such basis may be transferred to a related person or it may be lost entirely medicare tax on net investment income a us shareholder that is an individual or estate or a trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts exempt from such tax will generally be subject to a  tax on the lesser of i the us persons net investment income for a taxable year or ii the excess of the us persons modified adjusted gross income for such taxable year over  for a single individual  in the case of joint filers and  for married filing separate for these purposes net investment income will generally include interest dividends annuities royalties rents net gain from the disposition of stock unless such income or gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of a trade or business other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities and certain other income but will be reduced by any deductions properly allocable to such income or net gain a us person that is an individual estate or trust should consult its tax advisor regarding the applicability of the medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in our shares backup withholding we report to our us shareholders and the irs the amount of dividends paid during each calendar year and the amount of any tax withheld under the backup withholding rules a shareholder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to dividends paid at the fourth lowest rate of tax under section c of the code which is currently  unless the holder is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and when required demonstrates this fact or provides a taxpayer identification number certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules a us shareholder that does not provide us with its correct taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the irs backup withholding is not an additional tax any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the shareholders income tax liability in addition we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any shareholders who fail to certify their nonforeign status see taxation of nonus shareholders taxation of taxexempt shareholders the irs has ruled that amounts distributed as dividends by a reit to a taxexempt employees pension trust do not constitute unrelated business taxable income ubti based on that ruling dividend income from us should not be ubti to a taxexempt shareholder so long as the taxexempt shareholder except certain taxexempt shareholders described below has not held its shares as debt financed property within the meaning of the code and the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the taxexempt entity generally debt financed property is property the acquisition of which was financed through a borrowing by the taxexempt shareholder similarly income from the sale of shares will not constitute ubti unless a taxexempt shareholder has held its shares as debt financed property within the meaning of the code or has used the shares in a trade or business for taxexempt shareholders which are social clubs voluntary employee benefit associations supplemental unemployment benefit trusts and qualified group legal services plans exempt from us federal income taxation under code sections c c c and c respectively income from an investment in our shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve for certain purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares these prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements    table of contents notwithstanding the above however a portion of the dividends paid by a pension held reit may be treated as ubti to certain types of trusts that hold more than  by value of the interests in the reit a pension held reit is any reit if more than  by value of its shares are owned by at least one pension trust or one or more pension trusts each of which owns more than  by value of such shares and in the aggregate such pension trusts own more than  by value of its shares we do not expect to be classified as a pension held reit but because our shares are publicly traded we cannot guarantee this will always be the case taxexempt shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the us federal state local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in our shares taxation of nonus shareholders the rules governing us federal income taxation of the ownership and disposition of shares by persons that are not us shareholders nonus shareholders are complex no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules accordingly this discussion does not address all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to a nonus shareholder in light of its particular circumstances and does not address any state local or foreign tax consequences nonus shareholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the impact of us federal state local and foreign tax consequences to them of an investment in our shares including tax return filing requirements distributions distributions including certain stock dividends that are neither attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of us real property interests nor designated by us as capital gain dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits such distributions ordinarily will be subject to us withholding tax at a  rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty unless the distributions are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by you of a us trade or business or if an income tax treaty applies are attributable to a us permanent establishment of the nonus shareholder under certain treaties however lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from a reit certain certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income exemption in general nonus shareholders will not be considered engaged in a us trade or business or in the case of an income tax treaty as having a us permanent establishment solely by reason of their ownership of shares dividends that are treated as effectively connected with such a trade or business or if an income tax treaty applies is attributable to a us permanent establishment of the nonus shareholder will be subject to tax on a net basis that is after allowance for deductions at graduated rates in the same manner as dividends paid to us shareholders are subject to tax and are generally not subject to withholding any such dividends received by a nonus shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty we expect to withhold us federal income tax at the rate of  on any distributions made to a nonus shareholder unless        a lower treaty rate applies and you file with us an irs form wben or irs form wbene as applicable evidencing eligibility for such reduced treaty rate of withholding or        you file an irs form weci with us claiming that the distribution is income effectively connected with your trade or business    table of contents return of capital distributions distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to you to the extent that such distributions do not exceed your adjusted basis in our shares but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares distributions in excess of your adjusted basis in our shares will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of such shares the tax treatment of this gain is described below for withholding purposes we expect to treat all distributions as made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits however amounts withheld generally should be refundable if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was in fact in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits capital gain dividends and distributions attributable to a sale or exchange of us real property interests distributions to you that we properly designate as capital gain dividends other than those arising from the disposition of a us real property interest generally should not be subject to us federal income taxation unless        the investment in our shares is treated as effectively connected with your us trade or business in which case you will be subject to the same treatment as us shareholders with respect to such gain except that a nonus shareholder or if an income tax treaty applies it is attributable to a us permanent establishment of the nonus shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the  branch profits tax as discussed above or        you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the us for  days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met in which case you will be subject to a  tax on your capital gains for each year during which we qualify as a reit distributions that are attributable to net capital gain from the sale or exchange of us real property interests such as properties beneficially owned by us will be taxed to a nonus shareholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of  firpta under firpta such distributions paid to a nonus shareholder who owns more than  of the value of our shares at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of distribution will be subject to us federal income tax as income effectively connected with a us trade or business the firpta tax will apply to these distributions whether or not the distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend generally you will be taxed at the same capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals we will be required to withhold and to remit  or such lesser percentage provided in treasury regulations of any distribution to you that could be treated as a capital gain dividend the amount withheld is creditable against your us federal income tax liability however any distribution with respect to any class of shares which is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the united states is not subject to firpta and therefore not subject to the  us withholding tax described above if you did not own more than  of such class of shares at any time during the oneyear period ending on the date of the distribution the  exception instead such distributions will be treated as ordinary dividend distributions retention of net capital gains although the law is not clear on the matter it appears that amounts designated by us as retained capital gains in respect of the shares held by nonus shareholders generally should be treated in the same manner as actual distributions by us of capital gain dividends under this approach you would be able to offset as a credit against your us federal income tax liability resulting from your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains and to receive from the irs a refund to the extent your proportionate share of such tax paid by us exceeds your actual us federal income tax liability    table of contents sale of shares gain recognized by a nonus shareholder upon the sale or exchange of our shares generally will not be subject to us taxation unless such shares constitute a us real property interest our shares will not constitute a us real property interest so long as i we are a domesticallycontrolled qualified investment entity which includes a reit if at all times during a specified testing period less than  in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by nonus shareholders or ii such class of our shares is regularly traded as defined by applicable treasury regulations on an established securities market such as the nyse and you owned actually and constructively  or less in value of such class of our shares throughout the shorter of the period during which you held such shares or the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or exchange notwithstanding the foregoing gain from the sale or exchange of our shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be taxable to you if either  the investment in our shares is treated as effectively connected with your us trade or business or  you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the us for  days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met in addition even if we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity upon disposition of our shares subject to the  exception applicable to regularly traded stock described above you may be treated as having gain from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest if you  dispose of our shares within a day period preceding the exdividend date of a distribution any portion of which but for the disposition would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a us real property interest and  acquire or enter into a contract or option to acquire or are deemed to acquire substantially identical shares during the  day period beginning  days before the exdividend date if gain on the sale or exchange of our shares were subject to taxation under firpta you would be subject to regular us federal income tax with respect to such gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals in addition if our shares are not then traded on an established securities market the purchaser of the shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs  of the purchase price if amounts withheld on a sale redemption repurchase or exchange of our shares exceed the nonus shareholders tax liability resulting from such disposition such excess may be refunded or credited against such nonus shareholders us federal income tax liability provided that the required information is provided to the irs on a timely basis amounts withheld on any such sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our shares may not satisfy a nonus shareholders entire tax liability under firpta and such nonus shareholder remains liable for the timely payment of any remaining tax liability as discussed in more detail under taxation of taxable us shareholdersmedicare tax on net investment income a  medicare tax will apply in addition to regular income tax to certain net investment income the  medicare tax generally applies only to us shareholders however the irs in proposed treasury regulations has indicated that the  medicare tax may be applicable to nonus shareholders that are estates or trusts and have one or more us beneficiaries nonus shareholders should consult their own tax advisors about the possible application of the  medicare tax backup withholding tax and information reporting generally we must report annually to the irs the amount of dividends paid to you your name and address and the amount of tax withheld if any a similar report is sent to you pursuant to tax treaties or other agreements the irs may make its reports available to tax authorities in your country of residence payments of dividends or of proceeds from the disposition of shares made to you may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding unless you establish an exemption for example by properly certifying your nonus shareholder status on an irs form wben or irs form wbene as applicable or another appropriate version of irs form w notwithstanding the foregoing backup withholding and information reporting may apply if either we have or our paying agent has actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a us person    table of contents backup withholding is not an additional tax rather the us federal income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld if withholding results in an overpayment of taxes a refund or credit may be obtained provided that the required information is furnished to the irs taxation of holders of our debt securities the following summary describes certain of the principal us federal income tax consequences of ownership and disposition of our debt securities this discussion assumes the debt securities will be issued without original issue discount sometimes referred to as oid oid with respect to a debt security is the excess if any of the debt securitys stated redemption price at maturity over its issue price the stated redemption price at maturity is the sum of all payments provided by the debt security whether designated as interest or as principal other than payments of qualified stated interest interest on a debt security generally will constitute qualified stated interest if the interest is unconditionally payable or will be constructively received under section  of the code in cash or in property other than debt instruments issued by us at least annually at a single fixed rate the issue price of a debt security is the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt securities in the issuance that includes such debt security is sold for money excluding sales to bond houses brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters placement agents or wholesalers the amount of oid with respect to a debt security will be treated as zero if the oid is less than an amount equal to  multiplied by the product of the stated redemption price at maturity and the number of complete years to maturity or in the case of a debt security that provides for payment of any amount other than qualified stated interest prior to maturity the weighted average maturity of the debt security if one or more series of debt securities are issued with oid disclosure concerning the tax considerations arising therefrom will be included with the applicable prospectus supplement or other applicable offering materials under which those securities are offered taxation of taxable us debt holders as used herein the term us debt holders means a holder of our debt securities who for us federal income tax purposes is        a citizen or resident of the united states        a corporation partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states or any political subdivision thereof unless in the case of a partnership treasury regulations provide otherwise        an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or        a trust that is subject to the primary supervision of a us court and which has one or more us persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a us person if you are a us debt holder this section applies to you otherwise the section entitled taxation of nonus debt holders applies to you stated interest us debt holders generally must include interest on the debt securities in their us federal taxable income as ordinary income        when it accrues if the us debt holder uses the accrual method of accounting for us federal income tax purposes or        when the us debt holder actually or constructively receives it if the us debt holder uses the cash method of accounting for us federal income tax purposes    table of contents if we redeem or otherwise repurchase any of our debt securities we may be obligated to pay additional amounts in excess of stated principal and interest we intend to take the position that the debt securities should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of this additional payment assuming such position is respected a us debt holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such additional payment at the time such payment is received or accrued in accordance with such us debt holders method of accounting for us federal income tax purposes if the irs successfully challenged this position and the debt securities were treated as contingent payment debt instruments us debt holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on the debt securities and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any gain recognized on a sale exchange or redemption of a debt security us debt holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the debt securities of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof sale exchange or other taxable disposition of the debt securities unless a nonrecognition provision applies us debt holders must recognize taxable gain or loss on the sale exchange redemption retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security the amount of gain or loss equals the difference between i the amount the us debt holder receives for the debt security in cash or other property valued at fair market value less the amount thereof that is attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on the debt security and ii the us debt holders adjusted tax basis in the debt security a us debt holders initial tax basis in a debt security generally will equal the price the us debt holder paid for the debt security gain or loss generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if at the time the debt security is disposed of it has been held for more than one year otherwise it will be a shortterm capital gain or loss payments attributable to accrued interest which have not yet been included in income will be taxed as ordinary interest income the maximum us federal income tax rate on longterm capital gain on most capital assets held by an individual is currently  for individuals in the  marginal us federal income tax bracket the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations information reporting and backup withholding backup withholding at the applicable statutory rate may apply when a us debt holder receives interest payments on a debt security or proceeds upon the sale or other disposition of a debt security certain holders including among others corporations financial institutions and certain taxexempt organizations are generally not subject to backup withholding in addition backup withholding will not apply to a us debt holder who provides his or her social security or other taxpayer identification number in the prescribed manner unless        the irs notifies us or our paying agent that the taxpayer identification number provided is incorrect        the us debt holder fails to report interest and dividend payments received on the us debt holders tax return and the irs notifies us or our paying agent that backup withholding is required or        the us debt holder fails to certify under penalty of perjury that backup withholding does not apply a us debt holder who provides us or our paying agent with an incorrect taxpayer identification number may be subject to penalties imposed by the irs if backup withholding does apply the us debt holder may request a refund of the amounts withheld or use the amounts withheld as a credit against the us debt holders us federal income tax liability as long as the us debt holder provides the required information to the irs us debt holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining the exemption we will be required to furnish annually to the irs and to us debt holders information relating to the amount of interest paid on the debt securities and that information reporting may also apply to payments of proceeds from the sale of the debt securities to those holders some us debt holders including corporations financial institutions and certain taxexempt organizations generally are not currently subject to information reporting    table of contents medicare tax on net investment income for taxable years beginning after december   us debt holders who are individuals estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds are required to pay an additional  medicare tax on among other things interest on the debt securities and capital gains from the sale or other taxable disposition of debt securities the  tax is imposed on the lesser of i the us debt holders net investment income for the taxable year and ii the excess of the us debt holders modified adjusted gross income for the taxable year over a certain threshold which in the case of individuals will be between  and  depending on the individuals circumstances a us debt holder that is an individual trust or estate should consult its tax advisor regarding the effect if any of this legislation on their acquisition ownership and

nonus debt holders such as controlled foreign corporations and passive foreign investment companies such entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the us federal state local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them payments of interest interest paid to a nonus debt holder will not be subject to us federal income taxes or withholding tax if the interest is not effectively connected with the nonus debt holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states and the nonus debt holder        does not actually or constructively own a  or greater interest in the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock        is not a controlled foreign corporation with respect to which we are a related person within the

or business and        provides the appropriate certification as to the nonus debt holders status a nonus debt holder can generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly executed irs form wben or irs form wbene as applicable or appropriate substitute form to us or our paying agent if the debt securities are held through a financial institution or other agent acting on the nonus debt holders behalf the nonus debt holder may be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent the agent will then generally be required to provide appropriate certifications to us or our paying agent either directly or through other intermediaries special certification rules apply to foreign partnerships estates and trusts and in certain circumstances certifications as to foreign status of partners trust owners or beneficiaries may have to be provided to us or our paying agent if a nonus debt holder does not qualify for an exemption under these rules interest income from the debt securities may be subject to withholding tax at the rate of  or lower applicable treaty rate at the time such interest is paid to claim the benefit of a tax treaty a nonus debt holder must provide a properly executed irs form wben or irs form wbene as applicable before the payment of interest and a nonus debt holder may be required to obtain a us taxpayer identification number and provide documentary evidence issued by foreign governmental authorities to prove residence in the foreign country the payment of interest effectively connected with a us trade or business however would not be subject to a  withholding tax so long as the nonus debt holder provides us or our paying agent an adequate certification currently on irs form weci but such interest would be subject to
