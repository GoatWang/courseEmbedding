of  from the same quarter last year power ic revenue was  million down  from the prior quarter and up  from the same quarter last year service revenue was  million as compared to  million for the prior quarter and  million from the same quarter last year   in terms of segment mix this quarter’s computing segment represented  of the total revenue consumer  power supply and industrial  communications  service  and others    gross margin was  for the december quarter as compared to  in the prior quarter and  for the same quarter last year the increase in gross margin quarteroverquarter was mainly driven by the improved product mix   operating expenses for the quarter were  million compared to  million for the prior quarter and  million for the same quarter last year the higher operating expenses quarteroverquarter were primarily due to the increased variable compensations resulted from the better than expected company’s performance in calendar year    income tax expense was  million for the quarter compared to  million for the prior quarter and  million for the same quarter last year   page      net income attributable to aos for the quarter was approximately  million or  cents earnings per share as compared to  cents earnings per share for the prior quarter and  cents loss per share for the same quarter last year   nongaap eps attributable to aos for the quarter was  cents earnings per share as compared to  cents earnings per share for the prior quarter and break even for the same quarter last year nongaap eps excluded the effect of share based compensation expenses of  million for the december quarter as compared to  million in the prior quarter and  million in the same quarter last year   we continue to generate positive cash

our chongqing joint venture entered into a turnkey design and construction contract to build a manufacturing facility for assembly test and ” wafer fabrication for a total price of approximately  million which will be paid in accordance with the payment schedule based on the achievement of certain milestones we expect the construction work will start in mid february and finish in a year to a year and a half   with that now i would like to turn the call over to our ceo dr mike chang who will provide the business highlights for the quarter   mike chang chief executive officer   thank you yifan   our turnaround efforts continue to produce positive results for the december quarter typically a low season for us our gross margin exceeded the top end of the guidance range while the revenue of  million came in near the high end of our expectations this time last year i said that we hit an inflection point as our new products were gaining traction at designin and designwin levels and since then our relentless efforts to execute aos product roadmap enabled us to achieve an  growth in revenue compared to the same quarter a year ago also we continued to expand our gross margin by virtue of a favorable product mix of higher margin products as a result we posted nongaap earnings per share of  for the quarter i am pleased with our strong execution in the december quarter despite supply constraints at our third party foundries   the solid december performance marked a successful conclusion of the recovery plan that our board had commenced a few years ago during the course of calendar year  which was the last phase of our recovery plan we have been putting all our efforts and focus to deliver meaningful revenue growth and profitability our results speak to the substantial progress we have made the revenue grew  to  million in calendar year  from  million in  and the gross margin expanded about  basis points to  in  the bottom line swung to  cents earnings per share on a nongaap basis in  from a loss of  cents per share in  i am encouraged by the confidence and capability of our team to steer further improvement and growth in the coming years   page      while on the subject let me take a few moments to share my near to midterm vision for aos consistent with our ultimate goal of becoming a total power semiconductor solution provider aos has been evolving from a relatively small mosfet provider for a single market to a diversified and reliable supplier addressing four different target markets the next step in our journey is to steadily grow to be a more sizable force in the power semiconductor market it will serve as a firm foundation upon which our business model can fully demonstrate its scalability and leverage our business strategies are well aligned to reach the goal in  years and the entire team at aos remains committed to drive the objectives we have identified   now i will review our performance and initiatives in each business segment first computing segment it represented  of the total revenue in the december quarter the skylake ramp and the shipment of graphics card continued to improve and contributed to a counter seasonal strength we posted a  sequential increase and  growth yearoveryear our products designed in for skylake are compatible for kabylake platform with similar bom content which brings a smooth and seamless transition to the next platform furthermore our recent strides in graphics card application continued to make good progress as we have benefited from the gpu market expansion we continue to strive to broaden our bom content and customer engagement with the slowing decline in the computing market we expect to see our devotion coming to fruition in the next year or so   second consumer the revenue was  of the total it decreased  sequentially due to anticipated seasonality but grew by  compared to the prior year as we expanded revenue from ultra high definition tvs and other diversified applications our shipments to key tv customers were pulled into the september quarter to prepare for the holiday season and china golden week holidays resulting in a seasonal decline in the december quarter this segment is more exposed to the wafer shortage from thirdparty foundries that are operating at full capacity however we expect that the progressive shipments of the new products from our own fab will help us maintain the consumer segment’s revenue level in current calendar year   third power supply and industrial segment it was  of the total revenue which was down  sequentially but up  from last year as our products for the quick charger applications were well adopted by toptier chinese and korean smart phone customers under the tight supply environment we will continue to take a twopronged approach in managing this segment with regard to growing applications we will continue to expand the footprint and bom content with our new products for legacy products we will manage the mix to optimize our margin all in all we expect to maintain the revenue level in this segment for    page      last communications segment the revenue was  of the total revenue representing a decrease of  quarteroverquarter compared to the same quarter a year ago however it grew  a majority of the growth was propelled by the increased shipments of our alphadfn products supporting smartphone battery management applications in addition we penetrated into new sockets and gained market shares with our surge protection products during the quarter as the demand for alphadfn product line increases we expect the communication segment to continue to grow   in calendar year  while our main challenge is to manage our mix to ease the supply constraints and improve gross margin we still expect a healthy growth as we are entering the next chapter of aos journey we are optimistic that the continued execution of our business strategies will accelerate our expansion we believe that these efforts will create a firm foundation for sustainable growth in the years ahead   yifan liang guidance for the next quarter   as we look forward to the third quarter of fiscal year  we expect   · our march quarter’s revenue to be in the range of  million to  million · gaap gross margin to be approximately  plus or minus  · gaap operating expenses to be in the range of  million to  million · tax expenses
