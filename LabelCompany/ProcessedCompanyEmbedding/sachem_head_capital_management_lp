prnewsfotosachem head capital management exhibit b prnewsfotosachem head capital management exhibit c prnewsfotosachem head capital management new york feb   prnewswire  sachem head capital management today sent a letter to the board of directors of leading consumer goods company helen of troy limited nasdaq hele in the letter sachem head outlines its belief that helen of troy shares are materially undervalued highlighting the boards apparent unwillingness to respond to recent inquiries regarding potential strategic combinations and recommending actions for the board of directors to undertake to maximize value for the shareholders including a thorough and legitimate review of strategic alternatives the full text of the letter from sachem head capital management follows board of directors helen of troy limited one helen of troy plaza el paso tx  february   to the board of directors of helen of troy limited sachem head capital management is an investment partnership founded in july  that manages approximately  billion we selectively and constructively engage management to explore ways to create shareholder value as of february   sachem head owns  shares of helen of troy stock which represent approximately  of shares outstanding despite its high quality consumer brand portfolio including leading names such as oxo pur sure and pert helen of troys full value is not appreciated by public markets particularly relative to what we believe are its most comparable peers see exhibit a given this underperformance we believe it is critical that the board undertake a full review of strategic alternatives to explore opportunities to maximize value for all shareholders this should include a goodfaith sale process with a sincere evaluation of any legitimate offers rather than summary dismissals of inbound approaches as we understand has occurred over the past two weeks with at least one potential strategic buyer we believe helen of troy shares are and have been materially undervalued for several reasons poor governance has led to a discounted valuation multiple as an example an employment contract for the nowformer ceo entitled him to compensation of approximately  million in fiscal year  we believe the existence of this contract furthered a pattern of inadequate board oversight and internaldealing which results in a discounted valuation multiple being assigned to the business by public market investors the recurring cashgenerating power of the business is materially understated by gaap accounting depreciation  amortization expense is greater than recurring capital needs gaap depreciation  amortization overstates ongoing capital requirements by approximately  million due to the inclusion of annual transactionrelated amortization expense which does not represent a recurring cash expense of the business excessive ceo compensation artificially depresses earnings if the prior ceo had not resigned the offmarket compensation would have resulted in an understatement of ebit by approximately  million for fiscal year  as a result we believe that projected fiscal year  gaap net income understates the true earnings power of the business by roughly  see exhibit b the balance sheet is underutilized helen of troy is meaningfully less levered than its most comparable peers and has not historically returned excess capital to shareholders see exhibit c helen of troy has strategic assets that are highly attractive to potential acquirers we believe that helen of troys strong brands would be highly synergistic from both a revenue and cost perspective in the hands of a potential acquirer unique offshore corporate structure is a hidden asset helen of troy is based in bermuda which provides the company with attractive jurisdictional attributes including a low tax rate its offshore domicile also makes the company a potential candidate for an inversion transaction if helen of troy were to combine with a usbased company in such a transaction potentially through first reincorporating in ireland the uk or the netherlands its offshore status could provide meaningful economic value above and beyond the base operating value of its business to address these points in november  sachem head met with helen of troys thenchairman and ceo gerald rubin current interim ceo tom benson and thenlead director gary abromovitz to discuss our views on steps the company could take to maximize shareholder value topics discussed included a material capital return to shareholders via a leveraged recapitalization and share repurchase the possibility of pursuing an inversion transaction with a us company and ceo succession we suggested that the company retain financial and legal advisors to investigate these options the meeting was productive and we were encouraged by the spirit of collaboration present in the room over the course of the next several weeks we had followup conversations with gerald rubin who relayed to us that the company was willing to explore any and all alternatives to maximize shareholder value indeed in early january we were pleased to learn that the board had retained a leading investment bank as a financial advisor to explore a range of alternatives senior representatives of that bank assured us that their review would be broad and include but not be limited to our suggestions of a material capital return and a potential strategic transaction we were therefore surprised when the company issued a press release on january  stating that ceo gerald rubin had suddenly resigned and been replaced with an internally promoted new permanent ceo we were further disappointed to learn on our followup calls with the company and its financial advisor that the scope of the strategic review would likely be limited to capital return excluding a broader set of alternatives sachem head believes that limiting the scope of a strategic review and appointing a permanent ceo in the midst of undertaking such a review are steps that are counter to the potential maximization of shareholder value while the market reacted positively to mr rubins departure we believe that with the benefit of the full context shareholders should share our entirely different view mr rubin was engaged and supportive of a broad strategic alternatives process and we believe the circumstances surrounding his hasty resignation are ironically yet another example of inadequate board stewardship furthermore the hurried internal promotion of a division head to ceo without a comprehensive external search also seems imprudently rushed myopic and not in shareholders best interests sachem head has spoken to multiple potential strategic buyers and has reason to believe that there are several strategic and financial buyers who may be interested in pursuing an acquisition of helen of troy  sachem head has specific knowledge of at least one inquiry to the board in the past two weeks from a wellrespected company with financial resources and a proven acquisition track record that was rebuffed further sachem head has reason to believe that there may have been similar approaches from others despite the recent increase in helen of troys share price sachem head continues to believe that helen of troy is materially undervalued and that shares currently trade at a steep discount to the price a strategic buyer would be willing to pay for the company in light of the aforementioned facts sachem head believes the board should immediately take the following actions run a full sale process and vet any legitimate offers for the company we believe a sale of the business maximizes value for helen of troy shareholders potentially in the context of an inversion transaction and is the best outcome for the longterm health of helen of troys underlying businesses if a full and legitimate review of strategic alternatives fails to result in a sale of the company we expect management to optimize helen of troys balance sheet to maximize shareholder value helen of troy is materially underlevered relative to peers jarden and spectrum brands a more appropriate capital structure would create substantial value for shareholders in light of the unique strategic attributes of the business  we would remind the entire board of directors of your fiduciary duties that include maximizing value for shareholders and expect you to act accordingly sincerely scott ferguson sachem head capital management please see accompanying exhibits photo httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhnya  photo
