like brands by shawn parr minute read“brand” as a concept is misunderstood underappreciated and very often underutilizedadvertisementwhen brand comes up in a meeting it often means different things to different people and many executives speak the language of brand the way some of us speak spanish with a limited vocabulary and rotten accent and while being fluent in another language is helpful not understanding the definition and differentiating value and places to deploy it properly can be highly problematic despite the excellent books many courses and conferences dedicated to brand there is still confusion surrounding its meaning and how it should be operationalized even within the most sophisticated companiesat bulldog drummond one of our key practices guides a wide range of organizations from multibillion dollar internationals to passionate startups and notforprofits to define and unlock the power of their brand whether it’s refreshing or repositioning tired brands or building newtoworld brands from scratch we are most often hired by the executive team venture firm or private equity group driving the business to help explore and define the brand’s relevance and reason for being–and we’re often asked to explore the permission that brand has to stretch or expandafter working with so many leadership teams to develop and refresh brands i’ve come to the realization that brands are like people and people are like brands they are complex and like great people great brands are dimensional they have a soul personality and behaviors that differentiate them from others they leave an impression and invite you to engage with them great brands are interesting and make it clear why people need them and it’s from this vantage point that i’d like to offer a few key areas to help you think about the power of brandbrand is the sum of many parts why do so many executives who talk about brand not understand its full potential as a business asset many see it from a single tactical dimension instead of its entirety many mistakenly see brand as the logo an ad campaign or what’s on product packaging they don’t understand the strategic power that a fully articulated brand platform holds when deployed across all areas of the businesstake a minute to think about a friend who stands out from the crowd who has made an impression on others now think about why they’re memorable the impression we create when we meet other people is formed by the way we behave the way we look and dress the way we communicate and the value we deliver in the same way we form opinions about people we form opinions about brands brand is the impression we have of a product or a service and is based on the sum of our experiences and interactions with it everything a brand does mattersbrand is rational and emotional like people brands have two sides the rational and the emotional both sides need to be clearly defined and deployed for a brand to unlock its full potential think of a brand like a person living with purpose adding value to people’s lives and operating with a set of guiding principles start with being clear why your brand exists and what it’s trying to accomplish and then think about how it should behave to ensure it’s relevant and memorable the rational side is built on the passion to solve a problem or meet an unmet or unrealized need and this informs and fuels the brand’s purpose or reason for being just like a person who operates with integrity a brand should have a clearly defined set of principles or values that guide how it behaves the principles form the rational building blocks for the brand and combined with a clear mission what you intend to do to achieve your purpose and a clear strategy the immediate actions you will take to deliver on your mission a working platform is formed to guide the brand’s actions so they are relevant coordinated and consistentadvertisementthe brand strategy should guide and inform the brand’s personality and behavior working together to inform the emotional connections it makes with the people it serves the strategy should inform everything the brand does the actions it takes the places it appears and how it engages educates and entertains the emotional side of the brand is brought to life by all forms of memorable and relevant brand expression across internal company culture and external consumerfacing touchpoints these touchpoints include the experience design of the product or service visual written and dimensional communication advertising outreach customer service and the overall experience before during and after purchase brand differentiates just like memorable people brands that stand out from the crowd do so because they intrigue people are memorable and different compelling brands are relevant engaging entertaining and more often than not courageous they take a stand for or against something and have the confidence to stand apart from the crowd people remember compelling brands and know what to expect from themyour brand is one of the most important assets you possess to drive and differentiate your business if your brand is not clearly defined understood and embraced by the entire organization it will never realize its full potential to impact your business it’s important to ensure that there is understanding and clarity around what brand means in business terms and what it can do to drive innovation communication and differentiation and then it is imperative to have complete alignment on your brand platform with your entire executive team your brand is one of the most powerful drivers for engagement and performance across all areas of your business brand does not belong to marketing every ceo must be the leading brand ambassador and ensure every department head understands how to bring the brand to life at their level of the company because finance experts or lawyers lead many corporations they often rely on the cmo to own and champion the brand but just as culture isn’t the sole responsibility of hr brand is not the sole responsibility of marketing while the execution of many dimensions of brand specifically expression and communication traditionally sit with marketing the entire executive team has the responsibility to ensure they understand and champion the brand through their words actions and behaviors—and bring it to life through their function of the business every department in the company has a role to play in bringing the brand to life and to ensure it is alive vibrant and maximized brand needs love and attention just like people brands need to be carefully nurtured and managed and like people they get old and tired and need reinvigorating every cmo should perform a regular health check on their brand i don’t mean looking at brand awareness research but fully understanding the health of your brand internally do regular refresher sessions on brand for all key leaders starbucks just spent  million to make sure its staffers are passionately connected and understand who they are and where they are going as an organizationbrand clarity drives confidence and performance we’ve spent the past  months working with the ceo and executive team of a national brand that needed to redefine its reason for being and its place in the world the business was in significant danger with sales down by  yearoveryear stock prices at a week low employees operating with an unclear business strategy and a languishing culture one of the most significant issues holding the company back was the lack of alignment around brand and what it meant to the businessadvertisementafter working collaboratively with the executive team to develop a new brand platform and mobilize their organization of  people around it same store sales increased by  their stock price hit a week high and their employee engagement significantly increased this turnaround took courage commitment and patience to drive change and the single most important catalyst was brand clarity like confident people brands that operate with clarity generally deliver more consistent results–shawn

name global   submit a brand name can be one of the most valuable assets a company possesses it can lend credibility to product efficacy and provide an assurance of quality letting consumers know what they can expect when they buy a product but because brand building can be costly and time consuming it can be extremely advantageous for established brands to lend their name to a new item in the same category through line extensions in fact line extensions are approximately three to four times more common than “new manufacturer” and “new brand” launches combined for consumers line extensions create confidence in a new product’s ability to deliver against promises and can relieve some of the apprehension often associated with trying something new nielsen’s global new product innovation survey found that nearly sixin global respondents  prefer to buy new products from brands familiar to them and  say they purchased a new product because it was from a brand they like consumers in north america and latin america value brand recognition more than consumers in any other region in both it was the secondmost important reason after affordability that consumers said they purchase a new product brand recognition is particularly influential in developing markets on average more than twothirds of developingmarket respondents  say they prefer to buy new products from brands they’re familiar with compared with  in developed markets in addition more than onefifth of developingmarket respondents  say they purchased a new product because it was from a brand they like compared with  in developed markets “brands can signify quality and inspire confidence” said rob wengel senior vice president and managing director of nielsen innovation in the us “for a consumer with limited disposable income the potential loss from an underperforming product is magnified as a result they’re often hesitant to take a risk on a product that might not live up to expectations and are sometimes even willing to pay more for brands they trust for new products launched without the benefit of a strong brand name extra care must be taken to provide strong assurance that the product will be perceived as a good value for the money” it is important to keep in mind however that while a brand extension can provide a strong foundation for success it doesn’t guarantee it in fact if a company doesn’t manage a line extension well it could actually harm the parent brand to protect a brand’s reputation a line extension should clearly link with the core product while also offering consistency uniqueness and relevance in the market line extensions with little differentiation could lead to cannibalization likewise if a line extension varies too dramatically from the parent it can dilute sales consider convenience time pressures and stress are facts of life shoppers want products that help restore balance and free up time to do the things they value most more than onefifth of global respondents  say they purchased a new product because it was convenient and slightly fewer  say they purchased it because it made their life easier consumers’ desire for these kinds of products is even higher more than onequarter of global respondents say they wish more products were available that make their life easier  and are convenient to use  while conveniencemotivated purchasing is rated high in all regions shopper sentiment differs in regard to the order of importance in certain regions in latin america for example respondents list convenience after branded indulgent and familyfriendly products while in europe products that offer novelty indulgence and brand recognition are more important than convenience other findings include indepth looks at the top reasons
