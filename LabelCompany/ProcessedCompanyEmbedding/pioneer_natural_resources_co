basin permian basin the world’s second largest resource discovering a resource potential of more than  billion barrels oil equivalent bboe in the spraberrywolfcamp shales has reignited industry activity in the permian basin production from the midland basin located within the greater permian basin has increased more than  barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd since  and horizontal rigs now account for more than  percent of all drilling rigs in the area these findings rank the spraberrywolfcamp as the largest us oil field and as the secondlargest oil field in the world pioneer’s production more than doubled from  thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day mboepd in  to  mboepd in the first quarter of  during that time we successfully appraised six of the  prospective intervals within our extensive acreage position several of our wells hold records for highest initial production rates delivered from a specific interval even better production data proves many have a resource potential of more than  million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe each pioneer continues to be the largest producer in the spraberrywolfcamp with a resource potential of more than  bboe and an inventory of more than  untapped horizontal drilling locations   current horizontal drilling focus northern acreage wolfcamp b  wolfcamp a  lower spraberry shale  southern acreage wolfcamp b  west texas is pioneer’s foundation it’s where we began operations in the early s where we’ve grown our largest leasehold and where we are now developing several gamechanging shale formations pioneer built its acre position in the permian basin’s spraberry oil field over decades through property acquisitions mergers and exploratory efforts historically we focused on conventional vertical drilling and production in  our strategy shifted to unconventional operations that use advanced horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies we now target hydrocarbons in the field’s multiple oilrich spraberry and wolfcamp shale intervals after a successful fouryear transformation of our spraberrywolfcamp acreage into a worldclass horizontal play in which we have successfully appraised six highly prospective stacked intervals we shut down our vertical drilling program in early  this has allowed us to concentrate efforts on more capitalefficient horizontal shale development   spraberrywolfcamp shale intervals oil and gas resources are produced from multiple formations including the spraberry the jo mill the dean the wolfcamp the atoka the strawn and the mississippian depths range from  to  feet oil produced is west texas intermediate sweet and gas produced is casinghead gas that has a  btu average energy content a targeted approach seeing strong production results and robust economic returns from the early horizontal wells we drilled in  and  revolutionized our operations these wells targeted the wolfcamp b interval within the southern portion of our leasehold and the production rates were beyond encouraging in  we entered into a joint venture with sinochem a chinese conglomerate to accelerate horizontal development of the southern area which is known as pioneer’s southern wolfcamp asset or the southern wolfcamp joint venture area the process of transforming the rest of our leasehold – referred to as pioneer’s northern spraberrywolfcamp asset – from a vertical drilling program to a more capitalefficient horizontal drilling program soon followed our key focus for  was to appraise several wolfcamp intervals including the wolfcamp a wolfcamp b and wolfcamp d highly successful results coupled with increasing activity in our southern asset resulted in a  percent production growth yearoveryear from  to  and a substantial increase in our resource potential by april  we were operating  rigs in our northern asset alone our production from spraberrywolfcamp intervals grew another  percent throughout the year and we gained a greater understanding of the value of the shale intervals the lower spraberry shale interval is estimated to have the most oil in place of all the midland basin intervals our ongoing appraisal of the middle spraberry and jo mill intervals has confirmed their potential for future development as well   streamlining our operations our business engineering drilling completions and production teams are continuously working to improve and optimize our spraberrywolfcamp operations pioneer’s ongoing initiatives to reduce costs increase production gain efficiencies and protect the environment include focusing each rig on one interval – drilling one shale interval per rig allows us to focus on how to reduce drilling and completion time and costs more quickly increasing multiwell pad drilling – pioneer’s surface footprint is reduced when we drill multiple wells per pad expanding use of casing design modifications – improved casing designs provide an opportunity for cost reductions through decreased drilling time and reduction of downhole materials and are expected to save  to  million per well optimizing completions – we are working to improve the productivity and cost structure of our horizontal well completions by testing a variety of factors of our horizontal well completion program such as stage length clusters per stage fluid volumes and chemistry and proppent concentration in many cases we have been able to leverage knowledge gained from similar testing in our eagle ford shale operations testing dissolvable plug technologies – technologies reduce or eliminate coil tubing drill outs after fracture stimulation and are expected to save  per well securing longterm supplies of lowercost nonpotable water – reducing fresh water usage remains a top priority among pioneer’s water management initiatives we are evaluating the use of water from brackish reservoirs not suited for drinking or agriculture actively pursuing partnerships with local cities and municipalities to source wastewater and evaluating recycling technologies soliciting cost reductions from suppliers and service companies during the lower oil price environment – we are evaluating all of our operating costs such as materials contract drilling fuel labor rental equipment and well services and are working with our suppliers and service companies to reduce our costs by yearend      more resources detailed data on pioneer’s permian

httprdffreebasecomnsmeasurementunitdatedpercentage  if youre writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible

characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed
