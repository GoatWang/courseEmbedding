the price sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates duration is the dollar weighted average time to maturity of a bond utilizing the present value of all future cash flows babson capital selects the funds investments based on its analysis of opportunities and risks of various fixed income securities and market sectors currently babson capital may consider the following factors which may change over time and in particular cases the perceived potential for high income offered by different types of corporate and government obligations including mortgagebacked and other assetbacked securities diversification among industries and issuers credit ratings and sectors and the relative values offered by different securities babson capital may choose to sell securities with deteriorating credit or limited upside potential compared to other securities the fund expects that it will engage in active and frequent trading and so will typically have a relatively high portfolio turnover rate principal risks the following are the principal risks of the fund you have the potential to make money by investing in the fund but you can also lose money bank loans risk bank loans in which the fund may invest have similar risks to below investment grade fixed income securities changes in the financial condition of the borrower or economic conditions or other circumstances may reduce the capacity of the borrower to make principal and interest payments on such instruments and may lead to defaults senior secured bank loans are supported by collateral however the value of the collateral may be insufficient to cover the amount owed to the fund if the fund relies on a third party to administer a loan the fund is subject to the risk that the third party will fail to perform its obligations in addition if the fund holds only a participation interest in a loan made by a third party the funds receipt of payments on the loan will be dependent on the third partys willingness and ability to make those payments to the fund below investment grade fixed income securities risk below investment grade securities commonly known as junk or high yield bonds have speculative characteristics and involve greater volatility of price and yield greater risk of loss of principal and interest and generally reflect a greater possibility of an adverse change in financial condition that could affect an issuers ability to honor its obligations cash position risk the ability of the fund to meet its objective may be limited to the extent that it holds assets in cash or otherwise uninvested credit risk  the fund is subject to the risk that the issuer of an investment held by the fund or the counterparty to a transaction entered into by the fund will be unable or unwilling to honor its obligations derivatives risk derivatives involve risks different from and potentially greater than direct investments including risks of imperfect correlation between the value of derivatives and underlying assets     s counterparty default potential losses that partially or completely offset gains and illiquidity derivatives can create investment leverage and be highly volatile derivatives may result in losses greater than the amount invested if the value of a derivative does not correlate well with the particular market or asset class the derivative is designed to provide exposure to the derivative may not have the effect anticipated many derivatives are traded in the overthecounter market and not on exchanges dollar roll and reverse repurchase agreement transaction risk these transactions may create leverage and subject the fund to the credit risk of the counterparty fixed income securities risk the values of fixed income securities typically will decline during periods of rising interest rates and can also decline in response to changes in the financial condition of the issuer borrower counterparty or underlying collateral assets or changes in market economic industry political and regulatory conditions affecting a particular type of security or issuer or fixed income securities generally fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk the risk that the value of a fixed income security will fall when interest rates rise extension risk the risk that the average life of a security will be extended through a slowing of principal payments prepayment risk the risk that a security will be prepaid and the fund will be required to reinvest at a less favorable rate and credit risk foreign investment risk emerging markets risk currency risk foreign securities including adrs are subject to additional risks compared to securities of us issuers including international trade currency political regulatory and diplomatic risks foreign investments may be subject to the risks of seizure by a foreign government direct or indirect impact of sovereign debt default impositions of economic sanctions or restrictions on the exchange or export of foreign currency volatility due to political social or economic instability and tax increases in addition fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the values of foreign securities and the price of the funds shares these factors can make foreign investments especially those in emerging markets more volatile and less liquid than us investments emerging markets securities are subject to greater risks than securities issued in developed foreign markets including less liquidity greater price volatility higher relative rates of inflation greater political economic and social instability greater custody and operational risks and greater volatility in currency exchange rates investments in foreign currencies themselves directly or through derivatives transactions may be highly volatile and may create investment leverage frequent tradingportfolio turnover risk portfolio turnover generally involves some expense to the fund the trading costs and tax effects associated with portfolio turnover may adversely affect the funds performance inflation risk the value of assets or income from the funds investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the value of the funds assets can decline as can the value of the funds distributions leveraging risk  instruments and transactions including derivatives and reverse repurchase agreement transactions that create leverage may cause the value of an investment in the fund to be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded liquidity risk  certain securities may be difficult or impossible to sell or positions difficult to close out at a desirable time and price and the fund may be required to hold an investment that is declining in value management risk the fund relies on the managers ability to achieve its investment objective there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve the desired results and the fund may incur significant losses market risk the value of the funds portfolio securities may decline at times sharply and unpredictably as a result of unfavorable marketinduced changes affecting particular industries sectors or issuers the fund is subject to risks affecting issuers such as management performance financial leverage industry problems and reduced demand for goods or services mortgage and assetbacked securities risk investments in mortgage and assetbacked securities subject the fund to credit risk interest rate risk extension risk and prepayment risk among other risks mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities not issued by a government agency generally involve greater credit risk than securities issued by government agencies the types of mortgages for example residential or commercial mortgages underlying securities held by the fund may differ and be affected differently by market factors investments that receive only the interest portion or the principal portion of payments on the underlying assets may be more volatile than other investments the market for mortgage and assetbacked securities has recently experienced high volatility and a lack of liquidity as     s a result the value of many of these securities has significantly declined repurchase agreement risk these transactions must be fully collateralized at all times but involve some risk to a fund if the other party should default on its obligation and the fund is delayed or prevented from recovering the collateral us government securities risk obligations of certain us government agencies and instrumentalities are not backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and there can be no assurance that the us government would provide financial support to such agencies and instrumentalities valuation risk the fund is subject to the risk of mispricing or improper valuation of its investments in particular to the extent that its securities are fair valued whenissued delayed delivery tba and forward commitment transaction risk these transactions may create leverage and involve a risk of loss if the value of the securities declines prior to settlement

company an unaffiliated investment adviser or a qualified plan in other words rule etb provides exemptions when a vli account supporting flexible premium vli contracts invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for mixed funding but does not provide exemptions when such a vli account invests in shares of a management investment company that serves as a vehicle for extended mixed funding or shared funding  accordingly applicants request an order of the commission granting exemptions from sections a a a and b of the  act and rule etb thereunder in cases where a flexible premium vli account holds shares of funds and one or more of the following types of investors also hold shares of such funds  va accounts  vli accounts  a funds investment adviser or an affiliated person of the investment adviser andor  a qualified plan  as explained below applicants maintain that there is no policy reason for the sale of fund shares to qualified plans to prohibit or otherwise limit a participating insurance company from relying on the relief provided by rules eb and etb notwithstanding rule e and rule et each specifically provide that the relief granted thereunder is available only where shares of the underlying fund are offered exclusively to insurance company separate accounts in this regard applicants request exemptive relief in cases where vli accounts hold shares of the funds when shares of the funds are also sold to qualified plans  applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in shared funding from the exemptive relief provided under rules eb and etb or for excluding separate accounts and investment companies engaged in mixed funding from the exemptive relief provided under rule eb similarly applicants are not aware of any reason for excluding participating insurance companies from the exemptive relief requested because the funds may also sell their shares to qualified pension and retirement plans rather applicants assert that the proposed sale of shares of the funds to qualified plans in fact may allow for the development of larger pools of assets resulting in the potential for greater investment and diversification opportunities and for decreased expenses at higher asset levels resulting in greater cost efficiencies  for the reasons explained below applicants have concluded that investment by qualified plans in the funds should not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between owners of vli contracts and other types of investors or between owners of vli contracts issued by unaffiliated participating insurance companies  consistent with the commissions authority under section c of the act to grant exemptive orders to a class or classes of persons and transactions applicants request exemptions for a class consisting of participating insurance companies and their vli accounts investing in the existing funds and future funds as well as their principal underwriters that currently invest or in the future will invest in the funds  there is ample precedent in a variety of contexts for granting exemptive relief not only to the applicants in a given case but also to members of the class not currently identified that may be similarly situated in the future such class relief has been granted in various contexts and from a wide variety of the  acts provisions including class exemptions in the context of mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding such class exemptions have included among other things exemptions permitting the sale of shares by unnamed underlying funds to vli and va accounts of participating insurance companies and qualified plans  applicants note that the commission has previously granted exemptive orders in cases where openend management investment companies offer their shares directly to qualified plans in addition to offering their shares to separate accounts of affiliated or unaffiliated insurance companies which issue either or both variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance contracts applicants state that the order sought in their application is largely identical to these precedents with respect to the scope of the exemptions and the conditions proposed by the applicants  section c of the  act provides in part that the commission by order upon application may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the act or any rule or regulation thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act applicants submit that the exemptions requested are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  section a of the  act provides among other things that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered openend investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a start printed page disqualification enumerated in sections a or  rules ebi and ii and rules etbi and ii under the act provide exemptions from section a under certain circumstances subject to the limitations discussed above on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding these exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that directly participate in management of the underlying investment company  the relief provided by rules ebi and etbi permits a person that is disqualified under sections a or  of the  act to serve as an officer director or employee of the life insurance company or any of its affiliates as long as that person does not participate directly in the management or administration of the underlying investment company the relief provided by rules ebii and etbii under the act permits the life insurance company to serve as the underlying investment companys investment adviser or principal underwriter provided that none of the insurers personnel who are ineligible pursuant to section a participates in the management or administration of the investment company  in effect the partial relief granted in rules eb and etb under the act from the requirements of section  of the act limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with section  to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of section  those rules recognize that it is not necessary for the protection of investors or the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act to apply the provisions of section a to all individuals in a large insurance complex most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization applicants assert that it is also unnecessary to apply section a of the act to the many individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies or affiliated companies of participating insurance companies that may utilize the funds as investment vehicles for vli accounts and va accounts there is no regulatory purpose served in extending the monitoring requirements to embrace a full application of section as eligibility restrictions because of mixed funding extended mixed funding or shared funding the participating insurance companies and qualified plans are not expected to play any role in the management of the funds those individuals who participate in the management of the funds will remain the same regardless of which va accounts vli accounts insurance companies investment advisers or qualified plans use such funds applying the monitoring requirements of section a of the act because of investment by vli accounts and qualified plans would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose furthermore the increased monitoring costs could reduce the net rates of return realized by owners of vli contracts and plan participants moreover in the case of qualified plans the plans unlike separate accounts are not themselves investment companies and therefore are not subject to section  of the act furthermore it is not anticipated that a qualified plan would be an affiliated person of the funds except by virtue of its holding  or more of a funds shares  rules ebiii and etbiii under the act provide exemptions from passthrough voting requirements with respect to several significant matters assuming the limitations on mixed funding extended mixed funding and shared funding are observed rules ebiiia and etbiiia provide that the insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of its variable life insurance contract owners with respect to the investments of an underlying investment company or any contract between such an investment company and its investment adviser when required to do so by an insurance regulatory authority subject to the provisions of paragraphs bi and biia of rules e and et  rules ebiiib and etbiiia provide that an insurance company may disregard the voting instructions of owners of its variable life insurance contracts if such owners initiate any change in an underlying investment companys investment policies principal underwriter or any investment adviser provided that disregarding such voting instructions is reasonable and subject to the other provisions of paragraphs bii biib and biic of rules e and et  in the case of a change in the investment policies of the underlying investment company the insurance company in order to disregard contract owner voting instructions must make a good faith determination that such a change either would  violate state law or  result in investments that either a would not be consistent with the investment objectives of its separate account or b would vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques used by other separate accounts of the company or of an affiliated life insurance company with similar investment objectives  both rule e and rule et generally recognize that a variable life insurance contract is primarily a life insurance contract containing many important elements unique to life insurance contracts and subject to extensive state insurance regulation in adopting subparagraph biii of these rules the commission implicitly recognized that state insurance regulators have authority pursuant to state insurance laws or regulations to disapprove or require changes in investment policies investment advisers or principal underwriters  the sale of fund shares to qualified plans or investment advisers will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of passthrough voting rights shares sold to qualified plans will be held by such plans the exercise of voting rights by plans whether by trustees participants beneficiaries or investment managers engaged by the plans does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by vli accounts with respect to plans which are not registered as investment companies under the act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights to plan participants indeed to the contrary applicable law expressly reserves voting rights associated with plan assets to certain specified persons for example for many plans under section a of employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” shares of a portfolio of an investment company sold to a plan must be held by the trusts funding the plan section a also provides that the trustees of such trusts must have exclusive authority and discretion to manage and control the plan with two exceptions  when the plan expressly provides that the trustees are subject to the direction of a named fiduciary who is not a trustee in which case the trustees are subject to proper directions made in accordance with the terms of the plan and not contrary to erisa and  when the authority to manage acquire or dispose of assets of the plan is delegated to one or more investment managers pursuant to section c of erisa for such plans unless one of the above two exceptions stated in section a applies plan trustees have the exclusive authority and responsibility for voting start printed page investment company shares or related proxies held by their plan  if a named fiduciary to a plan appoints an investment manager the investment manager has the responsibility to vote the shares held unless the right to vote such shares is reserved to the trustees or another named fiduciary the plans may have their trustees or other fiduciaries exercise voting rights attributable to investment securities held by the plans in their discretion some plans however may provide for the trustees an investment adviser or advisers or another named fiduciary to exercise voting rights in accordance with instructions from plan participants  where a qualified plan does not provide participants with the right to give voting instructions applicants do not see any potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among the variable contract owners and plan participants with respect to voting of the respective fund shares accordingly unlike the circumstances surrounding vli accounts and va accounts because plans are not required to pass through voting rights to participants the issue of resolution of material irreconcilable conflicts of interest should not arise with respect to voting fund shares  in addition if a qualified plan were to hold a controlling interest in a fund applicants do not believe that such control would disadvantage other investors in such fund to any greater extent than is the case when any institutional shareholder holds a majority of the shares of any openend management investment company in this regard applicants submit that investment in a fund by a plan will not create any of the voting complications occasioned by vli account investments in the fund unlike vli account investments plan voting rights cannot be frustrated by veto rights of participating insurance companies or state insurance regulators  where a qualified plan provides participants with the right to instruct the trustees as to how to vote fund shares applicants see no reason why such participants generally or those in a particular plan either as a single group or in combination with participants in other plans would vote in a manner that would disadvantage vli contract owners the purchase of shares by plans that provide voting rights does not present any complications not otherwise occasioned by mixed or shared funding  similarly the sale of fund shares to an investment adviser will not have any impact on the exemptions requested herein regarding the disregard of passthrough voting rights the exercise of voting rights by investment advisers does not raise the type of issues respecting disregard of voting rights that are raised by vli accounts with respect to investment advisers which are not registered as investment companies under the act there is no requirement to pass through voting rights  applicants recognize that the prohibitions on mixed and shared funding might reflect concern regarding possible different investment motivations among investors when rule e was first adopted variable annuity separate accounts could invest in mutual funds whose shares were also offered to the general public therefore the commission staff may have been concerned with the potentially different investment motivations of public shareholders and owners of variable life insurance contracts there also may have been some concern with respect to the problems of permitting a state insurance regulatory authority to affect the operations of a publicly available mutual fund and the investment decisions of public shareholders  for reasons unrelated to the act however revenue ruling  sept   effectively deprived variable annuity contracts funded by publicly available mutual funds of their taxbenefited status the tax reform act of  codified the prohibition against the use of publicly available mutual funds as an investment vehicle for both variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance contracts in particular section h of the code in effect requires that the investments made by both variable annuity and variable life insurance separate accounts be “adequately diversified” if such a separate account is organized as part of a “twotiered” arrangement where the account invests in shares of an underlying openend investment company ie an underlying fund the diversification test will be applied to the underlying fund or to each of several underlying funds rather than to the separate account itself but only if “all of the beneficial interests” in the underlying fund “are held by one or more insurance companies or affiliated companies in their general account or in segregated asset accounts” accordingly a separate account that invests in a publicly available mutual fund will not be adequately diversified for these purposes as a result any underlying fund including the funds that sells shares to va accounts or vli accounts would in effect be precluded from also selling its shares to the public consequently the funds may not sell their shares to the public  applicants assert that the rights of an insurance company or a state insurance regulator to disregard the voting instructions of owners of variable contracts is not inconsistent with either mixed funding or shared funding the national association of insurance commissioners variable life insurance model regulation the “naic model regulation” suggests that it is unlikely that insurance regulators would find an underlying funds investment policy investment adviser or principal underwriter objectionable for one type of variable contract but not another type the naic model regulation has long permitted the use of a single underlying fund for different separate accounts moreover article vi section  of the naic model regulation has been amended to remove a previous prohibition on one separate account investing in another separate account lastly the naic model regulation does not distinguish between scheduled premium and flexible premium variable life insurance contracts the naic model regulation therefore reflects the naics apparent confidence that such combined funding is appropriate and that state insurance regulators can adequately protect the interests of owners of all variable contracts  applicants assert that shared funding by unaffiliated insurance companies does not present any issues that do not already exist where a single insurance company is licensed to do business in several or all states a particular state insurance regulator could require action that is inconsistent with the requirements of other states in which the insurance company offers its contracts however the fact that different insurers may be domiciled in different states does not create a significantly different or enlarged problem  shared funding by unaffiliated insurers in this respect is no different than the use of the same investment company as the funding vehicle for affiliated insurers which rules eb and etb permit affiliated insurers may be domiciled in different states and be subject to differing state law requirements affiliation does not reduce the potential if any exists for differences in state regulatory requirements in any event the conditions set forth below are designed to safeguard against and provide procedures for resolving any adverse effects that differences among state regulatory requirements may produce if a particular state insurance regulators decision conflicts with the start printed page majority of other state regulators then the affected participating insurance company will be required to withdraw its separate account investments in the relevant fund this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement that will be entered into by participating insurance companies with the relevant fund  rules eb and etb give participating insurance companies the right to disregard the voting instructions of vli contract owners in certain circumstances this right derives from the authority of state insurance regulators over vli accounts and va accounts under rules eb and etb a participating insurance company may disregard vli contract owner voting instructions only with respect to certain specified items affiliation does not eliminate the potential if any exists for divergent judgments as to the advisability or legality of a change in investment policies principal underwriter or investment adviser initiated by such contract owners the potential for disagreement is limited by the requirements in rules e and et that the participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions be reasonable and based on specific good faith determinations  a particular participating insurance companys disregard of voting instructions nevertheless could conflict with the voting instructions of a majority of vli contract owners the participating insurance companys action possibly could be different than the determination of all or some of the other participating insurance companies including affiliated insurers that the voting instructions of vli contract owners should prevail and either could preclude a majority vote approving the change or could represent a minority view if the participating insurance companys judgment represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the relevant funds election to withdraw its vli accounts and va accounts investments in the relevant fund no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal this requirement will be provided for in the participation agreement entered into by the participating insurance companies with the relevant fund  applicants assert that there is no reason why the investment policies of an fund would or should be materially different from what these policies would or should be if the fund supported only va accounts or vli accounts whether flexible premium or scheduled premium vli contrasts each type of insurance contract is designed as a longterm investment program  each fund will be managed to attempt to achieve its specified investment objective and not favor or disfavor any particular participating insurance company or type of insurance contract there is no reason to believe that different features of various types of variable contracts will lead to different investment policies for each or for different vli accounts and va accounts the sale of variable contracts and ultimate success of all va accounts and vli accounts depends at least in part on satisfactory investment performance which provides an incentive for each participating insurance company to seek optimal investment performance  furthermore no single investment strategy can be identified as appropriate to a particular variable contract each “pool” of vli contract and va contract owners is composed of individuals of diverse financial status age insurance needs and investment goals a fund supporting even one type of variable contract must accommodate these diverse factors in order to attract and retain purchasers permitting mixed and shared funding will provide economic support for the continuation of the funds mixed and shared funding will broaden the base of potential variable contract owner investors which may facilitate the establishment of additional funds serving diverse goals  applicants do not believe that the sale of the shares to plans will increase the potential for material irreconcilable conflicts of interest between or among different types of investors in particular applicants see very little potential for such conflicts beyond those that would otherwise exist between owners of vli contracts and va contracts applicants submit that either there are no conflicts of interest or that there exists the ability by the affected parties to resolve such conflicts consistent with the best interests of vli contract owners va contract owners and plan participants  applicants considered whether there are any issues raised under the code treasury regulations or revenue rulings thereunder if qualified plans va accounts and vli accounts all invest in the same fund applicants have concluded that neither the code nor the treasury regulations nor revenue rulings thereunder present any inherent conflicts of interest if plans vli accounts and va accounts all invest in the same fund  applicants note that while there are differences in the manner in which distributions from vli accounts and qualified plans are taxed these differences have no impact on the funds when distributions are to be made and a vli account or plan is unable to net purchase payments to make distributions the vli account or plan will redeem shares of the relevant fund at its net asset values in conformity with rule c under the act without the imposition of any sales charge to provide proceeds to meet distribution needs a participating insurance company will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of its vli contract and a plan will then make distributions in accordance with the terms of the plan  applicants considered whether it is possible to provide an equitable means of giving voting rights to vli contract owners and plans in connection with any meeting of fund shareholders the funds transfer agent will inform each participating insurance company investment adviser and qualified plan of their share holdings and provide other information necessary for such shareholders to participate in the meeting eg proxy materials each participating insurance company then will solicit voting instructions from owners of vli contracts and va contracts as required by either rules e or et or section deiiiaa of the act as applicable and its participation agreement with the relevant fund shares held by plans will be voted in accordance with applicable law the voting rights provided to plans with respect to the shares would be no different from the voting rights that are provided to plans with respect to shares of mutual funds sold to the general public furthermore if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a plans decision to disregard plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the plan may be required at the election of the relevant fund to withdraw its investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal  applicants do not believe that the ability of a fund to sell its shares to its investment adviser or qualified plans gives rise to a senior security “senior security” is defined in section g of the act to include “any stock of a class having priority over any other class as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends” as noted above regardless of the rights and benefits of participants under plans and owners of vli start printed page contracts vli accounts va accounts participating insurance companies and plans only have or will only have rights with respect to their respective shares of a fund these parties can only redeem such shares at net asset value no shareholder of a fund has any preference over any other shareholder with respect to distribution of assets or payment of dividends  applicants do not believe that the veto power of state insurance commissioners over certain potential changes to fund investment objectives approved by owners of vli contracts creates conflicts between the interests of such owners and the interests of plan participants applicants note that a basic premise of corporate democracy and shareholder voting is that not all shareholders may agree with a particular proposal their interests and opinions may differ but this does not mean that inherent conflicts of interest exist between or among such shareholders or that occasional conflicts of interest that do occur between or among them are likely to be irreconcilable  although participating insurance companies may have to overcome regulatory impediments in redeeming shares of a fund held by their vli accounts the plans and the participants in participantdirected plans can make decisions quickly and redeem their shares in a fund and reinvest in another investment company or other funding vehicle without impediments or as is the case with most plans hold cash pending suitable investment as a result conflicts between the interests of vli contract owners and the interests of plans and plan participants can usually be resolved quickly since the plans can on their own redeem their fund shares  finally applicants considered whether there is a potential for future conflicts of interest between participating insurance companies and qualified plans created by future changes in the tax laws applicants do not see any greater potential for material irreconcilable conflicts arising between the interests of vli contract owners or for that matter va contract owners and plan participants from future changes in the federal tax laws than that which already exists between vli contract owners and va contract owners  applicants recognize that the foregoing is not an allinclusive list but rather is representative of issues that they believe are relevant to their application applicants believe that the discussion contained therein demonstrates that the sale of fund shares to qualified plans would not increase the risk of material irreconcilable conflicts between the interests of plan participants and vli contract owners or other investors further applicants submit that the use of the funds with respect to plans is not substantially dissimilar from each funds current and anticipated use in that plans like vli accounts are generally longterm investors  applicants assert that permitting a fund to sell its shares to its investment adviser or the advisers affiliates for the purpose of obtaining seed money will enhance management of each fund without raising significant concerns regarding material irreconcilable conflicts among different types of investors a potential source of initial capital is a funds investment adviser however provision of seed capital or the purchase of shares in connection with the management of a fund by its investment adviser may be deemed to violate the exclusivity requirement of rule eb andor rule etb given the conditions of treasury regulation f and the harmony of interest between a fund on the one hand and its investment adviser or affiliates on the other applicants assert that little incentive for overreaching exists furthermore such investment should not implicate the concerns discussed above regarding the creation of material irreconcilable conflicts instead investments by an investment adviser or its affiliates will permit the orderly and efficient creation and operation of a fund and reduce the expense and uncertainty of using outside parties at the early stages of the funds operations  various factors have limited the number of insurance companies that offer variable contracts these factors include the costs of organizing and operating a funding vehicle certain insurers lack of experience with respect to investment management and the lack of name recognition by the public of certain insurance companies as investment experts in particular some smaller life insurance companies may not find it economically feasible or within their investment or administrative expertise to enter the variable contract business on their own use of the funds as a common investment vehicle for vli accounts would reduce or eliminate these concerns mixed and shared funding should also provide several benefits to owners of vli contracts by eliminating a significant portion of the costs of establishing and administering separate underlying funds  participating insurance companies will benefit not only from the investment and administrative expertise of the funds investment advisers and subadvisers but also from the potential cost efficiencies and investment flexibility afforded by larger pools of funds mixed and shared funding also would permit a greater amount of assets available for investment by a fund thereby promoting economies of scale by permitting increased safety through greater diversification or by making the addition of new funds more feasible therefore mixed and shared funding will encourage more insurance companies to offer vli accounts this should result in increased competition with respect to both vli account design and pricing which can in turn be expected to result in more product variety applicants also assert that sale of shares in a fund to qualified plans in addition to vli accounts and va accounts will result in an increased amount of assets available for investment in a fund this may benefit vli account owners by promoting economies of scale permitting increased safety of investments through greater diversification and making the addition of new funds more feasible  applicants also submit that regardless of the type of shareholder in a fund its investment adviser and the advisers affiliates are or would be contractually and otherwise obligated to manage the fund solely and exclusively in accordance with that funds investment objectives policies and restrictions as well as any guidelines established by its board of trustees a “board” thus each fund will be managed in the same manner as any other mutual fund  applicants note that vli accounts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds that are not affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the vli account in particular applicants assert that sales of fund shares as described above will not have any adverse federal income tax consequences to other investors in such a fund  in addition applicants assert that granting the exemptions requested herein is in the public interest and as discussed above will not compromise the regulatory purposes of sections a a a or b of the act or rules e or et thereunder applicants conditions applicants agree that the order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions which shall apply to the funds as well as any future fund that relies on the orderstart printed page   a majority of the board of each fund will consist of persons who are not “interested persons” of the fund as defined by section a of the  act and the rules thereunder and as modified by any applicable orders of the commission except that if this condition is not met by reason of death disqualification or bona fide resignation of any trustee or trustees then the operation of this condition will be suspended a for a period of  days if the vacancy or vacancies may be filled by the board b for a period of  days if a vote of shareholders is required to fill the vacancy or vacancies or c for such longer period as the commission may prescribe by order upon application or by future rule  each board will monitor its respective fund for the existence of any material irreconcilable conflict between and among the interests of the owners of all vli contracts and va contracts and participants of all plans investing in the fund and determine what action if any should be taken in response to such conflicts a material irreconcilable conflict may arise for a variety of reasons including a an action by any state insurance regulatory authority b a change in applicable federal or state insurance tax or securities laws or regulations or a public ruling private letter ruling noaction or interpretive letter or any similar action by insurance tax or securities regulatory authorities c an administrative or judicial decision in any relevant proceeding d the manner in which the investments of the fund are being managed e a difference in voting instructions given by va contract owners vli contract owners and plans or plan participants f a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard the voting instructions of contract owners or g if applicable a decision by a plan to disregard the voting instructions of plan participants  participating insurance companies on their own behalf as well as by virtue of any investment of general account assets in a fund any investment adviser to a fund and any plan that executes a participation agreement upon its becoming an owner of  or more of the net assets of a fund collectively “participants” will report any potential or existing conflicts to the relevant board each participant will be responsible for assisting the board in carrying out the boards responsibilities under these conditions by providing the board with all information reasonably necessary for the board to consider any issues raised this responsibility includes but is not limited to an obligation by each participating insurance company to inform the board whenever variable contract owner voting instructions are disregarded and if passthrough voting is applicable an obligation by each plan to inform the board whenever it has determined to disregard plan participant voting instructions the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board will be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreement with a fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of the variable contract owners the responsibility to report such information and conflicts and to assist the board also will be contractual obligations of all plans under their participation agreement with a fund and such agreements will provide that these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of plan participants  if it is determined by a majority of a board or a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees of such board that a material irreconcilable conflict exists then the relevant participant will at its expense and to the extent reasonably practicable as determined by a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees take whatever steps are necessary to remedy or eliminate the material irreconcilable conflict up to and including a withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of their vli accounts or va accounts from the fund and reinvesting such assets in a different investment vehicle including another fund b in the case of a participating insurance company submitting the question as to whether such segregation should be implemented to a vote of all affected variable contract owners and as appropriate segregating the assets of any appropriate group ie va contract owners or vli contact owners of one or more participating insurance companies that votes in favor of such segregation or offering to the affected contract owners the option of making such a change c withdrawing the assets allocable to some or all of the plans from the affected fund and reinvesting them in a different investment medium and d establishing a new registered management investment company or managed separate account if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a decision by a participating insurance company to disregard variable contract owner voting instructions and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote then the participating insurance company may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw such participating insurance companys va account and vli account investments in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal if a material irreconcilable conflict arises because of a plans decision to disregard plan participant voting instructions if applicable and that decision represents a minority position or would preclude a majority vote the plan may be required at the election of the fund to withdraw its investment in the fund and no charge or penalty will be imposed as a result of such withdrawal the responsibility to take remedial action in the event of a board determination of a material irreconcilable conflict and to bear the cost of such remedial action will be a contractual obligation of all participants under their participation agreement with a fund and these responsibilities will be carried out with a view only to the interests of variable contract owners or as applicable plan participants for purposes of this condition  a majority of the disinterested directorstrustees of the board of each fund will determine whether or not any proposed action adequately remedies any material irreconcilable conflict but in no event will the fund or its investment adviser be required to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract or plan no participating insurance company will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for any variable contract if any offer to do so has been declined by vote of a majority of the contract owners materially and adversely affected by the material irreconcilable conflict further no plan will be required by this condition  to establish a new funding vehicle for the plan if a a majority of the plan participants materially and adversely affected by the irreconcilable material conflict vote to decline such offer or b pursuant to documents governing the plan the plan trustee makes such decision without a plan participant vote  a boards determination of the existence of a material irreconcilable conflict and its implications will be made known in writing promptly to all participants  participating insurance companies will provide passthrough voting privileges to all variable contract owners whose contracts are issued through registered vli accounts or registered va accounts for as long as required by the act as interpreted by the commission however as to variable contracts issued through va accounts start printed page or vli accounts not registered as investment companies under the act passthrough voting privileges will be extended to owners of such contracts to the extent granted by the participating insurance company accordingly such participating insurance companies where applicable will vote the shares of each fund held in their vli accounts and va accounts in a manner consistent with voting instructions timely received from variable contract owners participating insurance companies will be responsible for assuring that each of their vli and va accounts investing in a fund calculates voting privileges in a manner consistent with all other participating insurance companies investing in that fund the obligation to calculate voting privileges as provided in this application shall be a contractual obligation of all participating insurance companies under their participation agreement with the fund each participating insurance company will vote shares of each fund held in its vli or va accounts for which no timely voting instructions are received as well as shares attributed to it in the same proportion as those shares for which voting instructions are received each plan will vote as required by applicable law governing plan documents and as provided in this application  as long as the act requires passthrough voting privileges to be provided to variable contract owners or the commission interprets the act to require the same a fund investment adviser or its affiliates will vote their shares of the fund in the same proportion as all votes cast on behalf of all variable contract owners having voting rights provided however that such an investment adviser or affiliates shall vote its shares in such other manner as may be required by the commission or its staff  each fund will comply with all provisions of the act requiring voting by shareholders which for these purposes shall be the persons having a voting interest in its shares and in particular the fund will either provide for annual meetings except to the extent that the commission may interpret section  of the act not to require such meetings or comply with section c of the act although each fund is not or will not be one of those trusts of the type described in section c of the act as well as with section a of the act and if and when applicable section b of the act further each fund will act in accordance with the commissions interpretations of the requirements of section a with respect to periodic elections of directorstrustees and with whatever rules the commission may promulgate thereto  a fund will make its shares available to the vli accounts va accounts and plans at or about the time it accepts any seed capital from its investment adviser or affiliates or from a general account of a participating insurance company  each fund has notified or will notify all participants that disclosure regarding potential risks of mixed and shared funding may be appropriate in vli account and va account prospectuses or plan documents each fund will disclose in its prospectus that a shares of the fund may be offered to both va accounts and vli accounts and if applicable to plans b due to differences in tax treatment and other considerations the interests of various variable contract owners participating in the fund and the interests of plan participants investing in the fund if applicable may conflict and c the funds board will monitor events in order to identify the existence of any material irreconcilable conflicts and to determine
