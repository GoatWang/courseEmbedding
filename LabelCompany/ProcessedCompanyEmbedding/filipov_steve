the growth of terex cranes under fil filipov these past  years has been a wild ride now his son is in the driving seat phil bishop meets the new president steve filipov he was born in chicago has a bulgarian father a cuban mother a french family he lives in paris and spends most of his working hours in germany these days so where does steve filipov consider himself to be from he admits that in sporting events he roots for both bulgaria and france but only it seems once the usa has been knocked out he is after all an american citizen and us passport holder so he considers himself american but europe and paris in particular is where he considers to be home it is where he has lived off and on since the age of  when his father fil was transferred by international harvestereducation came by way of the international school in brussels where he boarded and the university of texas where he studied business administration one suspects however that a more practical education came from the short period in the early s fresh out of university that he set himself up as an international trading company this involved filling up a truck in france with anything he though he could sell mundane products mostly such as chocolate or shirts or occasionally some industrial equipment and driving to the newly opened eastern europe including the land of his father bulgaria occasionally he’d sell the truck too and fly home he turned a profit he says but it was not to prove the route to riches that he had imagined he was a few years ahead of his time he believes because there was not yet enough money in the east to provide a large enough customer base for his goodsin  steve joined terex with his father and ron defeo fil filipov and defeo had been colleagues at ji case which had taken over international harvester in  fil filipov returned to the usa to manage koehring and terex’s subsequent crane acquisitions steve stayed in france working with marklift europe then clark france and then in  ppm with the acquisitions of comedil and peiner the importance of the european operations grew and although each division had its own manager steve was his father’s link man in europe in  the filipovs cut their teeth on their first german acquisitions – atlas and schaeff employment law in particular was what made german companies a trickier challenge as it turned out atlas and schaeff were just a prelude to the big one – demag – acquired in october  with demag and because of the current state of the us market  of terex cranes’production is outside of the usathe filipov legacysteve filipov has been handed control of a company very different from the one that he and his father first joined  years ago for a start it is five times bigger than it was in revenue terms there is a popularly held perception that the terex business model of cutting costs and reducing prices also involves cutting investment milking companies and closing them closure of two factories in the usa and the peiner factory in germany in the past year or so are cited as evidence it is a perception that steve filipov says is false since the product lines still exist – it is just that their production has been made more efficient and therefore profitableby relocation manitowoc closed a boom truck factory last year too he points outdemag accounts for about  of terex cranes’ business according to filipov demag’s share of the worldwide all terrain market is now  up from  when terex took it over the target is  of the worldwide at market some countries are going better than others of course in  passed grove and liebherr in the us all terrain market and took more than  of the uk market however demag’s home market of germany remains unconvinced it seems in germany market share in the first  months of  was just  this represents a recovery from the  share that demag had in the first half of  when the future of the company was in the air but it is still down on the  mark that has been demag’s average share in recent yearsprices have come down by  to  on average filipov says an ac  is available for not much more than e  compared with e  before terex while not every sale makes a profit he admits costs have been cut significantly partly by expanded purchasing power partly by reorganizing production under the old management demag’s old factory on dinglerstrasse in zweibrücken produced telescopic cranes above t capacity and lattice boom cranes the smaller telescopics were made at the nearby wallerscheid plant a newer and more efficient factory wallerscheid was also where all the telescopic booms were cut and bent terex has already saved e m a year by reducing the amount of transportation between wallerscheid and dinglerstrasse further savings will come as all telescopic crane production is moved to wallerscheid leaving dinglerstrasse just for lattice boom cranes more fabrication work has been outsourced including to demag’s subsidiary company in hungary laser cutting beds have been moved from wallerscheid to hungary except for the first dozen machines of newly introduced models not much is actually fabricated by demag any more it is mostly an assembly operation demag remains the only major cranemanufacturer to make its own telescopic booms but even this is set to go to an eastern german subcontractorcrane manufacturing is ‘not rocket science’ steve filipov says and making production more efficient requires common sense rather than a degree in production engineeringterex also has crane factories in france italy australia and the usa in france ppm’s future looked bleak when terex bought demag but it seems to be enjoying a slight renaissance with its new threeaxle ac  to add to its successful twoaxle cranes which filipov maintains are ‘the best twoaxle machines on the market’ although employee numbers were cut from  to  in  ppm produced  more product than in the previous year thanks to a  increase in the number of reachstackers producedin italy bendini had its best year ever in  with  rts produced many of them were for construction of the milan bologna high speed railway although half were for export filipov does not expect this performance to be repeated in  – around  units a year is more usual also in italy sales of comedil tower cranes increased  in  year on year production of ferro selferectors has doubled from  units to  units and that is to be increased again ‘that market is huge – probably five to six thousand units a year worldwide’ filipov says new product development is planned for comedil top slewers concentrating on smaller flattops the peiner tower crane factory in trier germany has been closed and sold three models – the   and  are to be produced at demag’s dinglerstrasse factory orders have been received from arcomet in belgium and from customers in the usasteve filipov spent a lot of time in australia after the demag takeover integrating operations with the existing organisation of franna the tractor crane manufacturer ‘the business is going ok in australia the market is up there’ he saysaccounting for just  of production now the us operation is based on two factories – mobile cranes and boom trucks in waverley and crawlers in wilmington wilmington is the old american crane factory and today it makes only boom sections for cranes brought in from ihi of japan there are no longer any original american crane crawlers being produced about  ihi crawlers have now been sold in the usa and the first sale to a european customer has been made two cc s to kranen michielsens of belgiumas to how he intends to tackle the depressed market in the usa filipov says ‘the focus for  is getting new product out and we’ve got a lot of projects going ’continuityat  steve filipov is young to be in charge of a billion dollar company but there are two factors to consider firstly youth is never a disadvantage at terex group president and ceo ron defeo was in charge of case europe at the age of  and has no reservations about promoting thirtysomethings to top positions colin robertson for example was promoted to president of terex construction in his mid thirtiessecondly the industry seems to be going through a generational shift many of the old guard are moving out during the market downturn and the next generation are finding their feet in preparation for the eventual upswing manitowoc crane group is now led by yearold glen tellock tadano has moved to third generation of family leaders under kouichi tadano who is in his forties among crane buyers too familyowned rental companies founded  or  years ago – in the early days of telescopic mobiles – are passing into control of the second generationit is unusual for publicly owned companies like terex to pass such senior positions from father to son but ron defeo believes the advantages outweigh any possible negative feelings ‘steve was the logical choice to continue the successful initiatives of terex and fil in this business i have watched steve grow and mature and i am confident that his leadership will provide a high level of continuity this is important in a business you need continuous improvement and continuity with the past change is inevitable but we need it to be seamless and positivethis accomplishes that’defeo continues ‘we have never discouraged family members to work within terex obviously there are always concerns but i have found the benefits outweigh the risks this is a little bit of the terex magic if i can be so bold to say that makes our employees feel special despite our aggressive business practices we have a sincere desire to make our company a family of entrepreneurs that are focused on delivering superior value to buyers of our equipment’throughout the rollercoaster ride of acquisitions and restructurings the filipovs have inevitably upset people who were thrown off or jumped along the way since october  for example about  people have left demag some were laid off while others decided they didn’t like the new environment and chose to go steve filipov says that there will be no changes at terex either in policy or style and he intends the handover to be seamless – a process aided by the retention of fil filipov on a parttime consultancy contract for three years‘i don’t think it will be any different’ steve filipov says ‘it the company has been successful because of the business model and the energy we’ve put into it by “we” i mean me and my father’energy is certainly a significant part of the equation steve works as hard as his father and says he finds little time for relaxation beyond spending time with his wife and two young daughters the elder is aged three the younger is  months at his paris home a three hour drive from demag while the terex business model stays in place steve filipov is not lacking in clear ideas of how to move the business forward ‘during the down market we have got to get our service support up to par worldwide’ he says ‘people are going to be seeing change’ but he suggestes that this is not a change in policy more q case of moving the terex project on to the next levelsteve filipov’s goals are ‘to keep growing the business to be the biggest and the best my main thing is to keep my feet on the ground not to be arrogant and to keep in touch with the business’ he plans to be ‘available all the time’ just like his father and ‘on every deal all the time’ he saysfil was always fired up by acquisitions the prospect of at least one more acquisition cannot be ruled out but steve seems more focused on making sales ‘he is closer to the customers than i am’ says his father‘that will probably be the most difficult thing for me to let go of a little bit’ steve says ‘if i’m going to grow the business and grow the profitability of the business i’m going to have to concentrate on the operations a little bit more’ this may not necessarily be as crucial as he thinks it is depending on whom he has around to help steve calls his father his ‘mentor’ and true enough fil filipov is a strong character whose shoes will be hard to fill but fil was first and foremost an operations man if steve wants to stay close to the customers there are other possible role models after all freddie bär was just  when he became managing director of liebherrwerk ehingen in  bär maintained an unrivalled relationship with his customer base over the following  years and it was upon this as much as technical excellence that liebherr’s rise to market leadership was based steve
