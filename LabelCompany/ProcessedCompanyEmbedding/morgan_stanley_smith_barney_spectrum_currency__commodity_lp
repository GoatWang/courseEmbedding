particular futures or option contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit positions in that futures or option contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading these market conditions could prevent the partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions there is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies the markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid which may prevent the partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the

or capital resources results of operations general cambridge employs a series of systematic proprietary decision tools to identify trading opportunities in the global currency markets the process combines three types of trading strategies a systematic technical strategy a systematic fundamental strategy and a market information strategy these trading tools are utilized in a set of systematic strategies which are combined into investment portfolios and are designed to perform across diverse market environments the systematic fundamental strategy is used in the asian currency section of the cambridge portfolios and reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect market views on the relative attractiveness of asian currencies versus the us dollar assets are allocated to the systematic fundamental strategy based on a proprietary measure of volatility in the global currency markets in highly volatile markets the allocation is reduced and when volatility is low the allocation is increased the market information strategy leverages the experience and global network of the portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows cambridge believes that long run success is achieved through successful mitigation of downside returns with risk controlled at the portfolio strategy and individual trade levels the following presents a summary of the partnerships operations for the three and six months ended june   and  and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading

operations general the partnerships results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of each trading advisors trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures forwards and options markets cambridge trades in its asian markets alpha programme and its emerging markets alpha programme on behalf of the partnership cambridges asian markets alpha programme employs a series of systematic proprietary decision tools to identify trading opportunities in the global currency markets the process combines three types of trading strategies a systematic technical strategy a systematic fundamental strategy and a market information strategy these trading tools are utilized in a set of systematic strategies which are combined into investment portfolios and are designed to perform across diverse market environments the systematic fundamental strategy is used in the asian currency section of cambridges portfolios and reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect market views on the relative attractiveness of asian currencies versus the us dollar assets are allocated to the systematic fundamental strategy based on a proprietary measure of volatility in the global currency markets in highly volatile markets the allocation is reduced and when volatility is low the allocation is increased the market information strategy leverages the experience and global network of the portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows cambridges emerging markets alpha programme aims to profit from short and medium term moves in the developing markets currency pairs to achieve this the strategy employs a largely systematic approach designed to perform across diverse market environments the process combines three decision making tools a systematic technical strategy a systematic fundamental strategy and a market information strategy during periods of higher volatility the systematic technical strategy uses a series of proprietary trading algorithms operating over multiple timeframes the algorithms combine trend continuation and trend reversal signals during periods of lower volatility the systematic fundamental strategy reflects a predetermined set of positions designed to reflect market views on the relative attractiveness of currencies versus the us dollar thereby realizing the inherent benefits of the carry trade the market information strategy leverages the experience and global network of cambridges portfolio managers to understand and exploit the behavior of other market participants and to participate in hedging and investment flows cambridge believes that long run success is achieved through successful mitigation of downside returns with risk controlled at the portfolio strategy and individual trade levels while a daily valueatrisk var limit is enforced at both the aggregate portfolio and substrategy level a further layer of risk mitigation is incorporated within each strategy for the systematic technical and market information strategies left side tail risk is monitored using a proprietary methodology grounded in extreme value theory within the systematic fundamental strategy the aggregate net us dollar exposure is maintained at zero krom river traded its krom commodity program on behalf of the partnership

three years in the period ended december   and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period it is important to note however that the trading advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisors or will be profitable in the future consequently the results of operations of the partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the trading advisors trading activities on behalf of the partnership during the period in question past performance is no guarantee of future results the partnerships results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap which requires the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements including the following the contracts the partnership trades are accounted for on a tradedate basis and marked to market on a daily basis the difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the statements of income and expenses as net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts and net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts allocated from kr master fund and net change in unrealized gains losses on open contracts allocated from cambridge master fund for open contracts and recorded as net realized gains losses on closed contracts and net realized gains losses on closed contracts

losses in the energy sector the most significant gains were recorded within the currency sector in september from short positions in the euro and japanese yen versus the us dollar in september the

for an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of  trading results refer to the partnerships annual report to limited partners for the year ended december   which is incorporated by reference to exhibit  of this form k the partnerships gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the partnership does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources market risk the partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of offbalance sheet market and credit risk the partnership trades futures contracts options on futures and forward contracts and forward contracts in global currency markets in entering into these contracts the partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions such as interest rate volatility resulting in such contracts being less valuable if the markets should move against all of the positions held by the partnership at the same time and the trading advisors were unable to offset positions of the partnership the partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to  of their capital accounts table of contents in addition to the trading advisors internal controls the trading advisors must comply with the partnerships trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained the trading advisors and ceres monitor the partnerships trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and ceres can require the trading advisors to modify positions of the partnership if ceres believes they violate the partnerships trading policies credit risk in addition to market risk in entering into futures forward and options contracts there is a credit risk to the partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the partnership the ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the partnership for futures forward and options contracts traded in the united states and most foreign exchanges on which the partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange in general a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of nonperformance by one of its members or one of its members customers which should significantly reduce this credit risk there is no assurance that a clearinghouse exchange or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the partnership and ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the partnership against a default by such parties further the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the brokers customers in cases where the partnership trades offexchange forward contracts with a counterparty the sole recourse of the partnership will be the forward contracts counterparty ceres deals with these credit risks of the partnership in several ways first ceres monitors the partnerships credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis the commodity brokers inform the partnership as with all of their customers of the partnerships net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions and ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the partnerships potential net credit exposure exchange by exchange by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange if any to the partnerships margin liability thereon second the partnerships trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the partnerships trading usually over several different products and exchanges historically the partnerships exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and on those relatively few occasions where the partnerships credit exposure climbs above such level ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than  of units then outstanding third with respect to forwards and options on forward contract trading the partnership trades with only those counterparties which ceres together with msco has determined to be creditworthy the partnership presently deals with msco as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts options on foreign currency forward contracts for additional

futures forwards and options the marketsensitive instruments held by the partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and as a result all or substantially all of the partnerships assets are at risk of trading loss unlike an operating company the risk of marketsensitive instruments is inherent to the primary business activity of the partnership the futures forwards and options on such contracts traded by the partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates exchange rates and prices of financial instruments and commodities factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of the partnerships open positions and consequently in its earnings whether realized or

managed futures llc acting as sponsor general partner manager investment manager and investment advisor to pooled investment vehicles with portfolios of managed futures funds are marketed and sold to institutional and highnetworth hnw investors through the mssb spectrum series of managed futures funds the rationale provided by morgan stanley’s financial advisors used to support its recommendation that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio in managed futures contracts is to generate portfolio returns with greater returns on a riskadjusted basis the purported low correlation of managed futures funds with the overall securities markets provides superior results for an investment portfolio during “down markets” which smooth portfolio returns over time morgan stanley financial advisors caution investors that they cannot “markettime” when to invest in managed futures funds which they argue makes investments in managed futures funds a permanent part of a buyhold asset allocation strategy the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed futures funds invest in asset classes that include trading futures contracts in equity indices ie developed and emerging markets interest rates ie us bonds eurodollar bonds eurobund commodities ie energy agriculture and metals and currencies ie dollar euro pound yen through investments in managed futures funds investors are allegedly able to access invests in nontraditional asset classes that have a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed income securities markets resulting an overall increase in investment returns on a riskadjusted basis at issue for investors is the performance of morgan stanley’s managed futures funds after the management fees have been deducted from the account in most instances investment advisors are compensated by a flat management fee based on assets under management additionally an “incentivebased” fee is deducted based on profits in “up” years this “performancebased” fee is usually paid net of all fees in addition to management and performance fees a managed futures account has deducted from the balance expenses for transactions costs and commissions the net result for investors has been the loss of trading profits from a poorlyexplained regime of excessive fees and conflicts of interest designed to enrich morgan stanley the morgan stanley spectrum series of managed
