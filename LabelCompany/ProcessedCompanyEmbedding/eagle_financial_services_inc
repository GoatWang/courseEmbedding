services inc show menu company locations faqs contact español frequently asked questions who is eagle loan eagle finance company “eagle” it may be easier to start by saying who eagle is not we are not a cash advance operation “payday lender” or a “title” lender those businesses continue to be under government scrutiny currently and sometimes consumer finance companies like eagle are incorrectly rolled into that same category this is likely because we are both not traditional banks but both still lend money however the similarities end there eagle is a traditional consumer finance company the business model and rates of traditional finance companies have fundamentally not changed in over  years with eagle you avoid the typical redtape that banks subject you to in order to get a small loan our primary business is simple personal loans to individuals typically loans are  and paid off in  months people use eagle for things as necessary and immediate as paying bills or as discretionary as taking a dream vacation some other examples are repairing a vehicle buying furniture home repair moving expenses and rebuilding personal credit who is a “typical” eagle customer in short middle america most of our customers have good paying jobs some of our customers have a low fico credit score because of a previous life situation unexpected medical expense job loss divorce sudden income decrease or maybe even just simple poor financial planning these individuals may not be able to borrow money at a traditional bank or credit card company other customers simply like the ease and convenience of doing business with eagle as such many of our existing customers are repeat customers and use eagle in the same fashion many americans responsibly use credit cards today eagle makes

eagle is independentlyowned and has been in business since  we lend with a sense of community we care about the wellbeing of our customers and strive to impart empathy at all times in every situation across the company our average branch manager has over  years of lending experience in the finance industry we make loan decisions locally we are a traditional finance company in an industry where the small loan rate structure has not changed significantly in the past  years typically the best pricing and most competitive rates will come from a bank if you choose an alternative to a traditional bank we’d strongly suggest avoiding tripledigit apr lenders such as payday title and check advance lenders we believe we are a reasonable alternative to this type of lending institution at eagle we offer monthly payment terms between  months for you to payback your loan when broken down into monthly payments it is much more manageable for you to be able to repay a debt most title  cash advance lenders expect their interest plus principle back within very short windows of time… typically between  weeks to  days we truly strive to treat you as we would a friend if you’re not sure… ask a
