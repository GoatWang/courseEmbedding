getting your estimate in writing then checking over your receipt with a fine tooth comb before anteing up but thats pretty much par for any service course also nobody called me when the work was done so i had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily but again not unexpected even at a dealership theyre not exactly heavy on the followup phone calls dave the general manager was friendly and approachable he checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem solving one of three and charged me for a half hours work im quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable he was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office while taking the car in still isnt my idea of a good time consider this lamb well sheared as i would totally return to executive getty the next time i have problems with my car which lets face it is inevitable deep sigh argh they no longer offer oil changes

very experienced and not salesmanlike as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadaysi took my car in for an oil change at am on a saturday they promised to have it done by pm but would try for noon  at about  i received a call saying the car was ready  there were no comments such as the car needs this or that flushed or we recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service  i greatly appreciated that particularly given that my car is older and has over k miles on it thus im always afraid that ill end up spending  on servicing it  the oil change was also cheaper than what

cik  the net proceeds to us from this offering are expected to be approximately   if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated offering expenses we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for acquisition of properties in the gas station and convenience store sector repayment or refinancing of outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement and general corporate purposes as of the date of this prospectus supplement we do not have any binding commitments or agreements relating to the acquisition of any properties however we review potential acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis and may have one or more potential acquisitions under consideration at any point in time which may be at varying stages of the negotiation and due diligence review process any such potential transactions are subject to substantial due diligence the negotiation of a definitive purchase and sale agreement and ancillary agreements and the receipt of various board of directors governmental and other approvals therefore there is significant uncertainty whether we will be able to successfully enter into a definitive agreement and consummate a proposed transaction even as to those proposed transactions for which we have entered into nonbinding letters of intent depending upon the size of a transaction it is possible that a transaction might impact our capital structure by diluting our existing shareholders or increasing our total indebtedness it is also possible that such a transaction could have a significant impact on our financial results we are party to a  million amended and restated senior unsecured credit agreement which expires in march  that we utilize from time to time to fund our working capital needs including acquisitions and capital expenditures subject to the terms of the credit agreement and continued compliance with its covenants we have the option to extend the term of the credit agreement for one additional year to march  as of march   borrowings under the credit agreement were  million bearing interest at a weightedaverage effective rate of  per annum the weightedaverage effective rate is based on  million of libor rate borrowings floating at market rates plus a margin of  and  million of libor rate borrowings effectively fixed at  by an interest rate swap agreement plus a margin of  we had  million available under the terms of the credit agreement as of march   affiliates of jp morgan securities inc and merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith incorporated are lenders under our credit agreement and will receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to the extent that net proceeds are used to pay down our credit agreement we may reborrow amounts repaid under our credit agreement with proceeds from this offering to fund future property acquisitions and for other general corporate purposes pending application of the net proceeds from this offering we will invest such proceeds in interestbearing accounts and shortterm interestbearing securities which are consistent with our intention to continue to qualify for taxation as a reit the sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly competitive where we own properties we compete for tenants with a large number of real estate property owners and other companies that sublet properties our principal means of competition are rents charged in relation to the income producing potential of the location in addition we expect other major real estate investors some with much greater financial resources or more experienced personnel than we have will compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities these competitors include petroleum manufacturing distributing and marketing companies other reits investment banking firms and private institutional investors this competition has increased prices for properties we seek to acquire and may impair our ability to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms in the future company description we are the leading publiclytraded real estate investment trust “reit” in the united states specializing in the ownership and leasing of retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and petroleum distribution terminals the operators of our properties are primarily distributors and retailers engaged in the sale of gasoline and other motor fuel products convenience store products automotive repair services and fast food over the past decade these lines of business have matured into a single industry as operators increased their emphasis on cobranded locations with multiple uses the combination of petroleum product sales with other offerings particularly convenience store products has helped provide onestop shopping for consumers and we believe has represented an important driver behind the industry’s growth as of march   we owned  properties and leased  properties nine of the properties we own are petroleum distribution terminals our properties are located primarily in the northeast and the midatlantic regions in the united states the company owns or leases properties in new york massachusetts new jersey pennsylvania connecticut maryland virginia new hampshire maine rhode island texas north carolina delaware hawaii california florida ohio arkansas illinois north dakota and vermont our typical property is used as a retail motor fuel outlet and convenience store and is located on between onehalf and three quarters of an acre of land in a metropolitan area we believe our network of retail motor fuel and convenience store properties and terminal properties across the northeast and the midatlantic regions of the united states is unique and that comparable networks of properties are not readily available for purchase or lease from other owners or landlords many of our properties are located at highly trafficked urban intersections or conveniently close to highway entrance or exit ramps the sector of the real estate industry in which we operate is highly competitive and we compete for tenants with a large number of property owners our principal means of competition are rents charged in relation to the income producing potential of the location in addition we expect other major real estate investors with significant capital will continue to compete with us for attractive acquisition opportunities these competitors include petroleum manufacturing distributing and marketing companies other reits investment funds and private institutional investors we are selfadministered and selfmanaged by our experienced management team which has over one hundred years of combined experience in owning leasing and managing retail motor fuel and convenience store properties our executive officers are engaged exclusively in the daytoday business of our company we administer nearly all management functions for our properties including leasing legal data processing finance and accounting our tenants are responsible for managing the operations conducted at the properties they rent from us and for the payment of taxes maintenance repair insurance and other operating expenses related to those properties our tenants’ financial results are largely dependent on the performance of the petroleum marketing industry which is highly competitive and subject to volatility as of march   we leased approximately  of our  owned and leased properties on a longterm triplenet basis to getty petroleum marketing inc “marketing” a whollyowned subsidiary of oao lukoil “lukoil” one of the largest integrated oil companies in the world marketing operates the petroleum distribution terminals but typically does not itself directly operate the retail motor fuel and convenience store properties it leases from us rather marketing generally subleases our retail properties to subtenants that either operate their gas stations convenience stores automotive repair services or other businesses at our properties or are petroleum distributors who may operate our properties directly andor sublet our properties to the operators  our founders started the business in  with the ownership of one gasoline service station in new york city and combined real estate ownership leasing and management with service station operation and petroleum distribution we held our initial public offering in  under the name power test corp we acquired from texaco in  the petroleum distribution and marketing assets of getty oil company in the northeast united states along with the getty r name and trademark in connection with our real estate and the petroleum marketing business in the united states in  we spunoff our petroleum marketing business to our shareholders as a separate nyse listed company marketing in  marketing was acquired by a subsidiary of oao lukoil one of the largest integrated russian

also a garage which seems to be quite good  what i like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older  ie very experienced and not salesmanlike as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadaysi took my car in for an oil change at am on a saturday they promised to have it done by pm but would try for noon  at about  i received a call saying the car was ready  there were no comments such as the car needs this or that flushed or we recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service  i greatly appreciated that particularly given that my car is older and has over k miles on it

course also nobody called me when the work was done so i had to check in at the end of the day and wait unnecessarily but again not unexpected even at a dealership theyre not exactly heavy on the followup phone calls dave the general manager was friendly and approachable he checked out my entire electrical system searching for a problem solving one of three and charged me for a half hours work im quite sure the task at hand took a good bit longer kenny was manning the desk and he was very helpful and personable he was also quick to provide me shuttle service to and from my office while taking the car in still isnt my idea of a good time consider this lamb well sheared as i would totally return to executive getty the next time i have problems with my car which lets face it is inevitable deep sigh argh they no longer offer oil changes or any such services on saturdays however any service during the week requires an appointmentvery inconvenient horrible experience i used to work across the street so i went there for convenience that stopped once i realized how they were overcharging me to add insult to injury the mechanics who looked  yrs old who were cleaning up when i came to pick up my vehicle were very rude  acted like i was inconveniencing them they were very short with me i would never go back ive been goiong there for  years probably through various owners they always do great work and have occasionally told me i needed less work than i thought or another mechanic thought i needed i trust them executive getty unclaimed this business has not yet been

seems to be quite good  what i like is the fact that the mechanics all seemed older  ie very experienced and not salesmanlike as some younger mechanics seem to be nowadaysi took my car in for an oil change at am on a saturday they promised to have it done by pm but would try for noon  at about  i received a call saying the car was ready  there were no comments such as the car needs this or that flushed or we recommend this ridiculously expensive and wholly unnecessary service  i greatly appreciated that particularly given that my car is older and has over k miles on it thus im always afraid that ill end up spending  on servicing it  the oil change was also cheaper than what one pays at jiffy lube or the like  ill definitely return read more was this review … useful  funny cool  bj m
