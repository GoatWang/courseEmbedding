lane judges and mcmanus chief judge northern district of iowa sitting by designation mcmanus judge roux laboratories inc appeals from the decision of the trademark trial and appeal board  dismissing its opposition to registration  on the principal register by clairol incorporated of the slogan hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure for a hair tinting dyeing and coloring preparation we affirm rouxs opposition is predicated on the grounds that it like clairol is engaged in the manufacture and sale of hair tinting dyeing and coloring preparations that it has used certain descriptive language in its advertising  of those products both before and after any use by clairol of the slogan sought to be registered that it believes the slogan hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure is a common laudatory advertising phrase which is merely descriptive of the goods — indeed so highly descriptive of them particularly of their qualities characteristics and function as well as of the result to be obtained from their use — that the slogan does not and could not function as a trademark to distinguish clairols goods and serve as an indication of origin and that it believes it would be damaged by registration of the slogan because clairol could employ said registration to harass it and its customers who might utilize that phrase  or others similar to it in connection with the sale and advertising of similar merchandise clairols record is stipulated it shows that since  clairol has marketed products for tinting and dyeing hair under the mark miss clairol and the notation hair color bath  to beauty salons and various retail outlets including drug stores in  clairols predecessorintitle embarked on an extensive advertising campaign to promote the sale of its miss clairol hair color preparations which included advertisements in national magazines on outdoor billboards and on car cards for bus and subway transit systems mailing pieces radio and television and pointofsale display material designed to be used by beauty salons and retailers as window or counter displays in association with the miss clairol product the illustrative exhibits of record reflect a now familiar format for much of that advertising — a large color photograph of an attractive woman often accompanied by a young child the question does she    or doesnt she prominently imprinted on or above the photograph the slogan hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure also conspicuously imprinted on or below the photograph and set apart from the other portions of the advertisement the mark miss clairol in large type and the notation hair color bath in smaller type below the photograph a representation of the packaged miss clairol hair coloring product and optionally advertising text extolling not unexpectedly the virtues and advantages of use of the product the record further shows that in the period  clairol sold over fifty million dollars worth of its miss clairol hair coloring product and expended some twentytwo million dollars for the above advertising material which contained the slogan sought to be registered it is stipulated that so far as the magazine and television media are concerned    during the same period and considering the press runs of all the various periodicals involved the total number of impressions of all the different advertisements in this series in periodicals all of them prominently displaying the slogan here opposed have much exceeded  million  counting as a separate impression each copy of each periodical carrying one such advertisement          conservatively estimated there have been more than a billion audio impressions of this slogan on network television in the united states one impression being one household having a tv set tuned to a given program at a given time the record also shows that with the exception of a single shipment of goods in  the slogan has not been used on the containers in which the hair color preparation has been packaged or on the bottles of hair color preparation themselves the appeal presents several issues  is the slogan hair color so nattural only her hairdresser knows for sure merely descriptive of clairols hair coloring preparations within the meaning of § e  of the trademark act  usc e   more broadly is the slogan a trademark at all as that term is used in the preamble of §  of the act and is defined in §  of the act  usc  in particular does it function to identify the goods as clairols and distinguish them from those manufactured or sold by others and if once merely descriptive has it nevertheless become distinctive of those goods in commerce  usc f  has use in commerce been made of the slogan by clairol as that expression is defined in §  of the act we shall deal with each of those issues seriatim a principal way of determining whether a particular expression is merely descriptive as applied to the goods is to ascertain the reaction of those to whom it is directed — the consumers in re colonial stores  fd   ccpa   blisscraft of hollywood v united plastics co  fd  d cir  vandenburgh trademark law and procedure nd edition §   we must point out initially that roux though it pleaded the matter has submitted no direct evidence that clairols slogan has merely a descriptive significance to purchasers of hair coloring preparations to the exclusion of either a suggestive connotation or any originindicating significance  it is apparently rouxs position that the slogan by reason of its very nature speaks for itself in that regard concentrating first on whether the slogan is descriptive roux maintains that the slogan is simply a laudatory advertising expression — a form of trade puffery as it were — used to describe and promote the product sold and identified by the recognized trademark miss clairol that there has been no suggestion as to any meaning which could be attributed to this phrase except the obvious one and that in the instant case the phrase sought to be registered hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure tells the purchaser only  what the goods are — hair coloring preparations  what their function is — to make the colored hair look natural  what their characteristics are — to color so expertly that only a hairdresser could detect the coloring and  what their use is — to color the hair expertly and thus achieve a natural appearance the descriptiveness of the instant slogan is also shown roux contends by the fact that both parties have used other expressions of similar meaning as part of their advertising copy to describe the purpose characteristics and result of use of their respective products though not free of controversy  we will assume for purposes of discussion that the words hair color and natural — indeed the words of the slogan in its entirety — were at inception of their use apt descriptive words used in an informative storytelling manner to describe the goods their function use and characteristics the question is still presented however whether the slogan remains merely or only descriptive or whether it now serves an originindicating function in addition to suitably describing attributes of the goods that question leads naturally to a discussion of the second broader issue posed earlier — whether the slogan is a trademark within the purview of the preamble to §  and of §  of the act and in particular whether it has become distinctive of the goods within the meaning of § f so as to no longer be merely descriptive of them  in other words — is it   or isnt it for its part clairol relies chiefly on the fact that it has used the slogan hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure in nearly all of its extensive advertising of its miss clairol products in various media since  including pointofsale displays to establish that the slogan has become wellknown to the purchasing public and serves to point to clairol as the source of the products in association with which the slogan is used clairol further contends    that the advertising referred to was highly effective in driving home the fact that the slogan mark here involved identifies the applicant as the source of the goods in connection with which that mark is displayed is very definitely established by applicants exhibits  and     those latter exhibits illustrating many parodies on the slogan and for the most part written by or representing the views of persons in the advertising newspaper and magazine professions are of relatively little assistance as direct evidence in determining whether the slogan does serve as an indication of origin to the purchasing public simply because the record does not establish to what extent if any those persons are members of the class who purchase clairols goods in the market in re duvernoy  sons inc  fd   ccpa   but that evidentiary void is not necessarily fatal to clairols case see in re hollywood brands inc  fd   ccpa   we are left then with the extensive advertising carrying the slogan and promoting its product that clairol has sponsored over the years and whatever inference can be drawn from that advertising and the remaining evidence of record clearly the board found an inference favorable to clairol based on the record herein which also includes various references to andor parodies on applicants slogan both by the press and advertising trade there can be no question that applicant has so extensively promoted its slogan that it must have made some impact on the purchasing public as an indication of origin while opposer urges that the advertising and promotion of the product is all directed to miss clairol and that the phrase hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure is merely a laudatory phrase which is directed to the character or quality of miss clairol hair coloring we are not persuaded that this is in fact the case applicants slogan is no doubt laudatory and somewhat descriptive of the desired result to be obtained from the use of applicants product on the other hand it is not so highly laudatory or descriptive as to be incapable of acquiring distinctiveness as a trademark    emphasis supplied while roux does not challenge the registrability of slogans on the principal register as a general proposition it does criticize the boards extensive if not exclusive reliance on clairols advertising campaign for its miss clairol product as circumstantial evidence establishing that the slogan is a trademark and has become distinctive of the goods in the public eye typical of rouxs variouslystated views are the following excerpts from its brief    that the material submitted failed to indicate any distinctiveness will be pointed out but it is believed that the phrase is so totally laudatory and descriptive that it could not have acquired any distinctiveness even if proof of trademark use had been submitted       no amount of money spent in advertising can change the inherent nature of this phrase and make it anything other than a generic advertising statement which merely describes the product it is not an indication of origin the law provides for the registration of trademarks not of advertisements       use of a trademark in extensive advertising may of course be used as one type of evidence tending to show that a trademark has been widely used and has become recognized it must however be a trademark and used as a trademark    the attempt to establish distinctiveness omitted any proof of trademark use or recognition of the phrase in question as a trademark          examination of the many advertisements submitted in connection with the file wrapper and in the exhibits submitted with appellees stipulated facts does not indicate or even tend to establish that hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure was used as a trademark or is capable of functioning as such true in many of these advertisements the phrase is prominently displayed mere size however does not change the obvious fact that the phrase describes and points to the claimed virtues of the hair coloring preparation sold as miss clairol and not to any hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure hair coloring preparation such a product bearing the phrase here involved was not available on the market at any time except for the single shipment and even as to that the phrase could have been only generically descriptive and would not have been recognized as a trademark the claim that extensive advertising cost indicates distinctiveness of this phrase ignores the fact that the advertising is for the miss clairol hair color bath    the determination of whether a given slogan is a registrable trademark is a matter which historically has not been free of difficulty  nor is it an easy task here the mere fact that a combination of words or a slogan is adopted and used by a manufacturer with the intent clairol has manifested here — that it identify its goods and distinguish them from those of others — does not necessarily mean that the slogan accomplishes that purpose in reality see in re standard oil co  fd   ccpa   the amount and character of the evidence if any required to establish that a given word or phrase is a trademark or has become distinctive of the goods necessarily depends on the facts of each case and particularly on the nature of the alleged mark at the outset as noted earlier it is not clear to us that clairols preliminary contention that the slogan is a fanciful arbitrary or even highly suggestive expression which without more presumptively functions as a trademark to indicate origin is necessarily correct on the other hand we do disagree with rouxs position as did the board that the slogan is so highly descriptive or generic that it is utterly incapable of functioning as a trademark or acquiring distinctiveness no matter what quantity of evidence of alleged distinctiveness or secondary meaning is submitted it is true of course that mere advertising or other evidence of supposed secondary meaning cannot convert something unregistrable by reason of its being the common descriptive name or generic name for the goods — the antithesis of a trademark — into a registrable mark in re g d searle  co  fd   ccpa   weiss noodle co v golden cracker  specialty co  fd   ccpa   j kohnstam ltd v louis marx  co et al  fd   ccpa   that does not mean that extensive advertising considered with other factors cannot be used to show a developed distinctiveness in a mark perhaps originally having some degree of descriptive significance when applied to the goods but capable of distinguishing them from those of others  see standard international corp v american sponge  chamois co  fd   ccpa   clinton detergent co v the procter  gamble co  fd   ccpa   considering all the factors here — exclusive prominent and repeated use of the slogan by clairol for at least ten years in association with the goods expenditures in that period of over  million dollars for pointofsale displays and other advertising material resulting in over a billion separate audio and visual impressions of the slogan and substantial sales of the product with which the slogan has been associated — we do not think the board erred in concluding that clairols slogan has made an impact upon the purchasing public as an indication of origin separate from and in addition to the impact of its miss clairol mark see in re hollywood brands inc supra in our view roux has not shown such an interest in the use of the particular slogan in issue in its business that damage to it will be presumed from registration by clairol it is apparent that the slogan is not in common use by roux or others to describe the same or similar products clairol having used it exclusively for a number of years nor is it one that roux finds or might find necessary to describe the features of its product in the ordinary course of business the record showing that roux has used several other descriptive expressions of somewhat similar import in its advertising copy to describe similar attributes of its goods we agree with the board as does clairol that damage to roux cannot ensue from registration of the instant slogan inasmuch as that slogan is not merely descriptive and its registration will not prevent the continued use by roux in its advertising of descriptive phrases like those it has used in the past  usc § b  in re chesapeake corp of virginia  fd   ccpa  in re automatic radio mfg co  fd   ccpa   one matter remains we have assumed heretofore that the slogan has been used on the goods in commerce as defined in §  of the act  usc §  as noted by the board however roux argued below that clairol is not entitled to registration because as shown by its stipulated testimony it made only a single shipment of goods in commerce bearing the slogan the slogan appeared on the cardboard containers in which glass bottles containing clairols hair coloring preparations were placed prior to the filing of its application in  and it has not used the slogan on its containers since that time  here roux embellishes on that argument adding that there obviously was no intent to continue use of the phrase on the package the use was not continued and there has been no suggestion of any such intent it seems to be rouxs position that even were the slogan otherwise capable of being a trademark clairol nevertheless has not made bona fide use of it on its goods in commerce — at least on its containers for the goods  — adequate to support a registration and thus is not an owner of a trademark used in commerce  usc §  cf fort howard paper co v kimberlyclark corp  fd   ccpa   cert denied  us    s ct   l ed d  whatever the merits of rouxs stance may be with respect to clairols use of the slogan on containers the board correctly observed that §  of the act provides other means by which a mark may be used on goods in commerce than on their containers viz that a mark shall be deemed to be used in commerce on goods when it is placed in any manner    on the displays associated therewith    and the goods are sold or transported in commerce emphasis supplied on that point roux urges the board erred in concluding that clairols use of its slogan has fully complied with that provision of §  there is no suggestion in the evidence roux argues that the pointofsale display cards on which clairol placed its slogan were actually used in association with the goods it further contends that the language used in the definition in section  requires something more than a mere advertisement and necessarily must consist of something directly associated with the goods is apparent both from the language of the statute and the nature of trademark use otherwise any advertisement which might be displayed in a shop would constitute trademark use however true the latter contention may be  rouxs argument consistently overlooks paragraph  of clairols stipulated testimony  and its accompanying photographic exhibits particularly exhibit items ll and m those items among others were stipulated to be typical of the many different displays of the same general character which were distributed to and displayed and used in beauty salons and retail stores during the period  to  and do in fact show the slogan prominently used on relatively large counter or window display cards of the standup type in close association with the goods like the board we are satisfied that clairols use of the slogan in the aforementioned stipulated manner though a use in a form of advertising to be sure is nevertheless a use on displays associated with the goods and satisfies the provisions of §  see in re e kahns sons co  fd   ccpa   in conclusion then although clairols slogan has been used in connection with the sale of its hair coloring preparations in a promotional advertising manner and may have some descriptive connotation with respect to them at the same time we think it has come by virtue of its use in extensive advertising together with its use in commerce on displays associated with the goods to serve as a means by which the public can identify the goods as those from a particular source and can distinguish those goods from those of others it has become distinctive of those goods that being the case it performs the basic function of a trademark as set forth in the trademark act and as commonly understood the decision of the board is affirmed affirmed   reported at  uspq    application serial no  filed may     roux agrees that the following examples taken from the text of its advertising copy of record and quoted by the board in its opinion are typical    only you and your hairdresser know where nature stopped and roux began    beautifully lustrously with completely naturallooking effects    to pick up where nature leaves off    naturallooking hair color    so matches natures look that no one knows its there the essence of good haircoloring is to look so natural that no one knows you used a cosmetic   nothing of record establishes that roux or anyone other than clairol has ever used the specific phrase hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure here sought to be registered   the expression hair color bath was found by this court to be the generic name by which clairols product was known to the public not a mark capable of distinguishing applicants goods and hence unregistrable on the supplemental register under §  of the lanham act clairol inc v roux distributing co inc  fd   ccpa     on the other hand as we shall see later in this opinion clairol has submitted no worthwhile direct evidence by way of customer letters or affidavits or surveys that consumers who purchase its products do in fact think of the slogan as identifying the products of a particular albeit anonymous source and employ it as one means whereby they can distinguish those products from others they do not know or do not want apparently the parties are content to have us subjectively decide what we think the consumers reaction to the slogan has been and would be in the market place and what use she would make of it based on what inferences we can draw from the evidence that is of record on the meaning of the words comprising the slogan and on their respective arguments we proceed accordingly   there may be some merit to clairols preliminary argument that the slogan is only suggestive of the desired result to be obtained from use of the goods not descriptive to the women who use miss clairol hair preparations to change their natural brown hair color to ash blonde or to return their now natural gray hair to something approaching its original color it could be said that the slogan hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure read literally might not evoke a response which connotes description of the goods or of the result of their use because as those women must fully realize the hair color resulting from that use is not in fact natural but artificial true it is that from the users standpoint the ersatz hair color obtained will hopefully be naturalappearing or looking but that arguably is the implicit suggestion not literal description of the desirable result or effect to be obtained that the slogan actually arouses indeed in that sense the slogan might well be characterized as misdescriptive of the result obtained on use of the goods in many if not most cases though certainly not deceptively so perhaps it is as one court put it in another context with respect to another mark used suggestively as a euphemism for guile in making hair appear what it is not see clairol inc v gillette co  f supp  dced ny affirmed  fd  nd cir    the pertinent portions of  usc §  read no

not a trademark    by the same token to the extent that a descriptive mark other than the generic or common descriptive name of the goods can and has become distinctive of the the goods in commerce or in trademark parlance has acquired a secondary meaning it no longer is merely descriptive of them   see for example beran protection of slogans in the patent office and the courts  tmr   and the chronology of cases discussed therein   the size of advertising expenditures alone has been found to serve as strong evidence of secondary meaning goodyear tire  rubber co v h rosenthal co  f supp  dcminn   while the board curiously enough characterized the question raised by roux as ex parte in nature even though it was pleaded in paragraph  of the notice of opposition its decision on the matter appears to have been inter partes perhaps in deference to this courts repeated admonitions not to render separate ex parte rulings in certain inter partes situations see fort howard paper co v kimberlyclark corp infra golden gate salami co v gulf states paper corp  fd   ccpa   roger  gallet v janmarie inc  fd   ccpa   gillette co v george p kempel  fd   ccpa   neither party questions our right to pass on the issue here both having developed their arguments fully in their briefs   the record does show that clairol has included the slogan on the direction sheet packed in each container of its miss clairol hair tint products since about march    see powermatics inc v globe roofing products co inc  fd   ccpa     that paragraph reads   applicants exhibit  accompanying this stipulation is a collection of pointofsale displays for the miss clairol hair color bath hair tints which show the slogan here opposed such displays have been prepared and distributed by applicant and its predecessor from time to time during the period from may  to the present each such distribution has involved large quantities of the display pieces concerned in the tens of thousands for each distribution such distributions have covered beauty salons and retail outlets throughout the country and the items so distributed have been and are being displayed in such salons and retail outlets where the miss clairol hair tints have been and are being used and sold the copyright notice years shown on various items in applicants exhibit  identify the respective years when the items were first distributed the pointofsale displays which comprise applicants exhibit  are identified in the list which is applicants exhibit a such displays are only a few examples which are typical of the many different displays of the same general character which were distributed to and displayed and used in beauty salons and retail stores during the period from may  to the present there have been more than fifty  distributions of pointofsale display pieces of these types each of them prominently displaying the slogan here opposed hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure the total number of all such pointofsale pieces which have been distributed down to the present exceeds three million  emphasis supplied search this case google scholar google books legal blogs google web bing
