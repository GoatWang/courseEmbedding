could be the role of a lifetime at  he has held more than two dozen jobs at eight companies including schlumberger ltd sap america inc oracle corp nasdaq orcl compaq and briefly hewlettpackard co nyse hpq in midnovember he accepted the offer to become chairman and ceo of bankrupt carrier worldcom inc otc wcoeq capellass resumé speaks volumes about his restless ambition he was once quoted as saying “i always wanted the toughest job with that in mind capellas would be hard pressed to find a harder job than the one he has just taken on although worldcom still hails as the nations no  longdistance communications company and one of the worlds largest internet carriers it has been tainted by scandal and buried in bankruptcy and like the rest of the telecommunications market it is struggling to stay alive although capellas has not had any traditional telecom experience he has gained a reputation as an astute manager most recently he served as president of hewlettpackard and before that he was chairman and ceo of compaq where he helped broker the  merger between compaq and hp he joined compaq in  as chief information officer and also served as chief operating officer before being named ceo in july  prior to his compaq days capellas held senior positions at sap america and oracle corp in areas ranging from application development to sales and general management he also spent  years with schlumberger a global technology service provider in management positions around the world several industry observers say they think capellas is a good choice for worldcom a highprofile ceo certainly increases the odds of the company emerging from bankruptcy” says john hodulik an analyst with ubs warburg “i would say this is a good sign for them unlike former worldcom ceo bernard ebbers whose aggressive acquisition strategy has received much of the blame for the accounting scandals surrounding the carrier capellas is viewed as a conservative cautious strategist he is credited with bringing stability if not massive growth to compaq after he took over the company in  “getting someone with a conservative approach might be the best move in the world right now” says frank dzubeck president of communications network architects “he’d be a good one for the job capellas will certainly have his work cut out for him the company has admitted that its earnings misstatements for the past couple of years total more than  billion and most observers expect even more accounting problems to come out of the woodwork in coming months see worldcom restatements top b worldcom says it plans to pay its new chairman and ceo a salary of  million for his first year on the job this includes a  million base salary along with a  million signing bonus and other potential performance bonuses worth  million according to bankruptcy filings capellas will also get another  million in restricted stock in the newly reorganized worldcom when it emerges from bankruptcy the company expects to come out of bankruptcy in mid the proposed worldcom package would be a nice bump up from capellass former job according to a securities and exchange commission sec filing capellas’s annual salary for  was  million and he received  million in other compensation as of last year former worldcom ceo ebbers reportedly made  million in base salary he recieved a  million bonus in  and still owes the company more than  million in loans the compensation package still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court and pass the scrutiny of the courtappointed monitor richard breeden a hearing to review

or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
