into the causes of that uncertainty and why in his view everything would be ok i hear from our clients where are things going to go what should we do blankfein said and ill tell you its uncertain for a reason because there are a lot of new things going on the trump administration is expected to take a significantly different policy stance not only from the obama administrations he said but also from what we might have expected from democratic candidate hillary clinton thats a very wide gap blankfein said and most of those policy changes are in the nature of stimulus under trump blankfein said we can expect to see less regulation rather than more lower taxes rather than higher and a bigger commitment to infrastructure spending that has boosted grossdomesticproduct expectations and optimism blankfein last may described the low confidence environment in the us and its impacts on various businesses within goldman sachs at the time he said there were signs on the horizon that we were moving away from that period including rising employment levels low energy prices and the federal reserves decision to start raising interest rates president donald trump jonathan ernstgetty images blankfein said however that the positive turn the markets had taken since trumps election should be viewed in the wider context of a previously evolving macroeconomic environment expectations for rising interest rates for example were already baked in before the election blankfein has previously said the market rally that followed trumps electoral win was a continuation of a trend it was drawing people in the direction that it was already heading the chief executive said at the world economic forum in davos switzerland in january change in general creates opportunity in this weeks video he pointed to some potential adjustments ahead including diverging currency rates as a result of diverging economic performance the cost of that divergence youll get differences in interest rates that could very well lead to differences in currency rates blankfein said but that doesnt mean were in unprecedented times he said its a vanity always at any given moment to think my goodness we have challenges of a dimension weve never seen before — the world is more uncertain he said it always seems uncertain when youre living in it and it always seems so simple and sure when youre looking back at it instead blankfein said were simply undergoing a change from a cycle of low economic activity very low interest rates and a high level of pessimism about the future now markets are seeing more growth potential more opportunity and more optimism so id say change in general creates opportunity he said but change from a pessimistic state of mind to one of more optimism is the better of

goldman sachs ceo lloyd blankfein has been bullish on china for years but at a briefing hosted by the wall street journal on wednesday morning he slammed the countrys handling of market forces as amateurish blankfein said it was a hamhanded way they dealt with the collapse referring to government intervention when the countrys stock market collapsed twice this summer they dont have a lot of experience at this market stuff these are the harshest words about the chinese economy weve heard from the generally optimistic blankfein and they get to the heart of how investors views on china have changed over the past few months investors are starting to question how the chinese government is managing its unique system but back to blankfein in an interview with bloomberg tv back in july he sounded more like his usual bullish self and asked host stephanie ruhle just as a thought experiment thinking in the shortterm and longterm if i said you have to — would you invest in china for the next year — think of your answer to that question and then if i said to you you had to invest within for  years but you couldnt touch it for  years — it was for your children — would you invest in china for the next  years his point was that china was a great investment opportunity thats the standard line back in  when goldman sold its stake in chinese bank icbc he went on a media tour reiterating the banks bullish stance on the countrys future a year later he told charlie rose that chinas rise already meant a new world order well you know you can look at it in the worst terms he said us has a competitor in the best terms theres no locus but on wednesday he sounded less optimistic painting a picture of a clumsily managed economy china is focused on  growth at any cost he said its a target out of reach for the foreseeable future most wall street analysts have chinese grossdomesticproduct growth sitting at around  others say its actually somewhere around  to  blankfein continued theyll put a smoke belching factory in the middle of a city  in china when they want to pump up their economy  they build  airports he added that  of them would be in the wrong location blankfein has always recognized that this way of allocating resources for growth is fundamental to the chinese model the question now is whether its a model the government can manage effectively at the briefing on wednesday one attendee asked blankfein about chinas role as the biggest holder of us debt he responded that he would rather the chinese have a stake in americas future than vice versa id rather they hold our debt than we hold their debt he said id rather owe money to the chinese they have a stake in our success during the financial crisis they were worried about us we werent

coming — and coming and coming through the day and into the evening goldman sachs officials met with confrontation and blunt questioning as senators from both parties challenged them over their aggressive marketing of mortgage investments at a time when the housing market was already starting to falter in an atmosphere charged by public animosity toward wall street the senators compared the bankers to bookies and asked why goldman had sold investments that its own sales team had disparaged with a vulgarity “the idea that wall street came out of this thing just fine thank you is just something that just grates on people” said senator edward e kaufman jr a democrat from delaware “they think you didn’t just come out fine because it was luck they think you guys just really gamed this thing real well” but throughout a subcommittee hearing lasting more than  hours current and former goldman officials insisted that they had done nothing to mislead their clients time and again the senators and the goldman executives among them the chairman and chief executive lloyd c blankfein seemed to be talking past each other among the goldman retinue was fabrice p tourre a vice president who helped create and sell a mortgage investment that figures in a fraud suit filed this month by the securities and exchange commission mr tourre defended his role in the sale of the investment in his opening remarks to the senate permanent subcommittee on investigations mr tourre declared “i deny categorically the sec’s allegation and i will defend myself in court against this false claim” senate investigators are building on the sec case which accuses goldman of defrauding investors in a transaction called abacus ac the hearing was held against the backdrop of a debate about overhauling financial regulation during the questioning senators highlighted the need for greater openness and questioned the ethics of the financial sector at one point the goldman witnesses were asked what they would change in the regulatory system “clearly some things need to be changed” said daniel l sparks a former partner and head of the mortgage trading department in the goldman sachs group who was one of the four initial witnesses steering away from financial jargon the senators tried to put a human face on the questioning senator john ensign republican of nevada declared that more transparency was needed “so we don’t end up hurting the little guys out there on main street” a republican member senator susan m collins of maine turned from one witness to the next as she asked repeatedly whether they felt a duty to act in the best interest of their clients only one of the four witnesses she questioned seemed to affirm such a duty outright in what almost added up to a light moment senator mark l pryor democrat of arkansas said the public wanted to know what went wrong and “how we can fix it” adding that americans feel that wall street contributed to the financial crisis “people feel like you are betting with other people’s money and other people’s future” he said “instead of wall street it looks like las vegas” senator ensign said he took offense at the comparison saying that in las vegas the casinos do not manipulate the odds while you are playing the game the better analogy he said would be to someone playing a slot machine while the “guys on wall street” were “tweaking the odds in their favor” the gap between wall street and the rest of the country was a recurring theme with senators occasionally pointing out how much goldman and indeed the witnesses had profited as the overall economy was headed for a plunge senator claire mccaskill democrat of missouri mentioned during her questioning that she was trying to “home in on why i have so many unemployed people” and lost money in pensions the questioning tuesday put the goldman witnesses on the defensive with the senators expressing exasperation that they were deliberately dodging questions or stalling for time it was at  am one minute late when the session began with opening remarks from subcommittee chairman senator carl levin democrat of michigan the public galleries accommodating roughly  people were full and included four people dressed in mock striped prison jumpsuits who jeered at the goldman officials “how do you live with yourself fab” one shouted as mr tourre was ushered out of the chamber after his testimony a tone of confrontation was set at the beginning with senator levin’s opening remarks he said the questioning would focus on the role of investment banks in the financial crisis and particularly on the activities of goldman sachs in  which “contributed to the economic collapse that came full blown the following year” while the hearing had ramifications for the entire sector and the activities of lenders to make more money from risky mortgage loans senator levin added it was focusing on goldman as an “active player in building this mortgage machinery” he said that while the sec suit and the courts would address the legality of its activities “the question for us is one of ethics and policy were goldman’s actions in  appropriate and if not should we act to bar similar actions in the future” in addition to mr tourre and mr sparks goldman executives testifying included joshua s birnbaum a former managing director in the structured products group trading and michael j swenson another managing director in that group a second panel included david a viniar executive vice president and chief financial officer and craig w broderick the chief risk officer at one point mr viniar prompted a collective gasp when mr levin asked him how he felt when he learned that goldman employees had used vulgar terms to describe the poor quality of certain goldman deals mr viniar replied “i think that’s very unfortunate to have on email” senator levin then berated mr viniar for not saying that he was appalled that goldman employees even thought their deals were of poor quality much less put it in email mr viniar later apologized as the hearing stretched into the evening mr blankfein goldman’s chief entered the chamber with an almost angry demeanor in a brief prepared statement he held tight to goldman’s defenses later asked if he knew the housing market was doomed mr blankfein replied “i think we’re not that smart” mr blankfein was asked repeatedly whether goldman sold securities that it also bet against and whether goldman treated those clients properly “you say betting against” mr blankfein said in a lengthy exchange but he said the people who were coming to goldman for risk in the housing market got just that exposure to the housing market “the unfortunate thing” he said “is that the housing market went south very quickly” senator levin pressed mr blankfein again on whether his customers should know what goldman workers think of deals they are selling and mr blankfein reiterated his position that sophisticated investors should be allowed to buy what they want mr blankfein was also pressed on the deal at the center of the sec case he said the investment was not meant to fail as the sec claims and in fact that the deal was a success in that it conveyed “risk that people wanted to have and in a market that’s not a failure” to which senator jon tester democrat of montana replied “it’s like we’re speaking a different language here” christine hauser contributed reporting from new york a version of this article appeared in print on april   on page b of the new york edition sign in to email print reprints get free
