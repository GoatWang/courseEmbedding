signing on home business biographies fl richard d ca fairbank — biography richard d fairbank – chairman and chief executive officer capital one financial corporation nationality american born ca  education stanford university ba  mba career strategic planning associates – partner and consultant signet banking corporation – eventually head of creditcard unit capital one financial corporation – chairman and ceo awards business leader of the year washingtonian  top  ceos worth   best ceos worth  influential personalities in financial services future banker  entrepreneur of the year credit card management  excellence in technology award gartner group address capital one financial corporation po box  richmond virginia  httpwwwcapitalonecom ■ richard d fairbank along with his former partner nigel morris was the cofounder of capital one financial corporation the firm that redesigned the credit model and revolutionized the banking and lending industry in the united states during the s fairbank and morris were able to use the tools of the emerging informationtechnology industry to target different credit plans toward different customer groups this database marketing approach to vending credit known as the informationbased strategy made capital one a major player in the banking industry in the first eight years of its existence the company that was spun off from signet banking in  opened  million accounts worth a total of  billion the company claimed that it created  new accounts daily in  and that its credit cards were in use in about  percent of all american homes during his early years at the helm of capital one fairbank became known for his loose management style which was described by jennifer kingson bloom in american banker as new age september   employees were rewarded with stock options in addition to their salaries senior management as well usually received the majority of their compensation in the form of stock options such a method of compensation gave employees on all levels a more vested interest in the success of the company after federal regulators investigated the companys lending practices in  the compensation policy was changed bringing capital one out of the entrepreneurial era and back in line with traditional banking practices computerized innovation the impetus for fairbanks highly successful career was his understanding of information technology and the impact it could have on the lending industry in  he and his partner nigel morris came up with a radical idea that would permanently change the way credit cards were issued most creditcard issuers had been charging holders an annual fee for the privilege of drawing on the issuers credit the pair of consultants idea was to drop the annual fee and instead target different credit cards to specific segments of the population the problem they faced was how to compile the demographics and other statistics that would help them sort out and identify those segments thus information technology came into the picture fairbank and morris met with representatives of oracle corporation and explained their requirements they needed a flexible database into which data from a variety of sources—ranging from information compiled by creditcard bureaus to purchased lists of consumers—could be entered that data would then be manipulated by databasemanagement software in order to produce a variety of reports based on different scenarios the reports would eventually be used to produce lists of potential customers who were carefully selected to correspond to the terms the creditcard issuer wished to offer such targeted marketing would the two consultants argued lead to huge profits based on the large numbers of customers expected to sign up through the program signing on fairbank and morris tried for a number of months to sell their targetedmarketing program to traditional banks but met with little success a year and a half passed before signet bank a smaller player with offices in central virginia took a chance on their system the young consultants agreed to manage signets creditcard accounts investing a portion of the profits they earned in the new database model the basic informationsystem controls were in place by  and the following year signet launched its targetedmarketing campaign using models compiled over the previous several years as derived from the immense database signet was able to offer about three hundred different types of creditcard agreements to their customers adjusting terms and interest rates to suit their customers projected preferences the other major breakthrough that fairbank and morris made possible with their targetedmarketing database was the addition of the abilities to offer customers low introductory interest rates and to transfer balances from one card to another with a lower rate of interest the introductory teaser rates–sometimes as low as zero percent—were meant to attract new customers and were wildly successful the risks that fairbank and morriss innovations posed met with resistance from executives trained in traditional banking practices top executives at signet as well as at other banking firms doubted that the young mens system would prove profitable in  signets realestate loan business went into a severe decline in order to offset losses managers wanted to kill the creditcard program that fairbank and morris were in the process of refining at that time in order to save their plan the pair conceived of the idea of the balance transfer customers could move debt from highinterest accounts to new signet accounts that offered the very low teaser interest rates since many of the clientele who were attracted to these offers were lowrisk borrowers—and leaped at the chance to lower their debt—the program proved enormously successful signets creditcard business doubled in size during  the first year in which the corporation used fairbank and morriss new financial models fairbank became the head of the creditcard division in  when his former boss david k hunt left signet around that time signet revamped its entire management structure in order to improve efficiency striking out on their own capital one financial corporation was created in  when signet spun off its creditcard business into a subsidiary company during the following year capital one outpaced its parent corporation in sales and services in an interview with bloom in american banker  morris explained that signet had moved from being a bank that owned a creditcard issuing company to being a creditcard business that had a regional bank attached to it september   capital one broke away from signet entirely in  when signet was later taken over by first union corporation the creditcard issuer maintained its independence by mid capital one had entered the ranks of the topten creditcard issuers in the united states with  billion in receivable income—an increase of  percent over the companys  net earnings earnings forecasters predicted further growth of  percent during  the companys third year of existence capital ones main strength lay in the fact that it was not merely a creditcard issuing company but was in fact an informationgathering company that issued credit cards the database of customer information painstakingly compiled through years of work at signet allowed capital one to identify the ideal creditcard customers—those that paid parts of their outstanding balances but kept some revolving credit such customers were charged interest rates ranging from  to  percent throughout the industry capital one sought these customers out and offered better deals in the hopes of drawing them away from their current card companies capital ones success in identifying prize customers and coaxing them to transfer their accounts was imitated by several other major cardissuing bank houses including advanta corporation first usa and mbna corporation those businesses quickly began to make the same types of customer offers that capital one had pioneered reduced introductory interest rates accountbalance transfers and other special deals the new competitors spent huge amounts on massmailing solicitations but none had the one advantage that made capital one such a highgrowth performer the complex customer database and the algorithms that turned the information therein into real marketbased strategies information technology as an informationtechnology–centered corporation one of capital ones first challenges was to deal with the mixed it legacy that it had inherited from signet in  in an effort to control it costs signet shipped most of its informationtechnology functions out to eds fairbank and morris had felt that capital one could manage its own it functions more efficiently than eds so the two had set out to incorporate those functions into the new companys structure they brought in an it specialist the cio jim donehey to meet capital ones needs donehey recognized the strengths of fairbank and morriss databases which were built on the framework designed by oracle corporation however the material portions of the new companys it was in a shambles an earlier occupant had sandwiched the mainframe system between the buildings kitchen and its restrooms leaving the data vulnerable to both fire and flood if capital one intended to bring major business functions such as generalledger accounting purchasing payroll and personnel safely back to the company from eds it needed new equipment new training for it staff and new security measures to protect the information fairbank morris and donehey also created new management structures in order to integrate it more thoroughly into the companys business processes it representatives participated in the daily management of capital one unlike at other corporations where information technology was treated as a support function for marketing and other traditionally organized business departments branching out fairbank and morris further utilized their customer databases by diversifying from the creditcard business into other areas one of their first such ventures was into the field of cellulartelephone services the subsidiary america one communications was launched in  rather than investing large sums in basic infrastructure america one bought dead airtime from existing companies repackaged it in the form of special deals and then used its enormous databases to communicate those special deals to those most likely to be interested america one thrived for five years before capital one sold its assets off to other telecommunications companies with the majority of the accounts—representing about  customers—going to sprint pcs on september   the success of america one communications proved that fairbank and morriss informationbased strategy could be applied to businesses outside the creditcard field fairbank went as far as to claim that the advent of modern electronic databases prefigured a marketing revolution that would rival the technology revolution that had been made possible by the modern microcomputer he claimed that capital one had the capacity to customize its products to satisfy the requirements of individual customers even when the company was adding  new customers each day and offering about  different variations on its credit products all this fairbank implied was the result of the targeted marketing he and morris had pioneered radical pay structures another area in which fairbank was a pioneer was executive compensation unlike other chief executives who received salaries and rewards whether their companies performed well or not fairbank and morris chose to receive most of their compensation in the form of stock options in  fairbank received no pay at all—nor any retirement plan contributions or bonuses—despite the fact that capital ones earnings had doubled in the previous two years analysts noted that fairbank and morris essentially bet their executive salaries on the performance of capital ones stock as long as the stock continued to rise they made money if it faltered on the other hand they lost their incomes this system as instituted by the two young executives proved enormously popular with investors jaded by the huge salaries taken by many other corporation heads out of a precarious position although the systems that fairbank and morris created worked well for capital one by  their gungho tactics and looserthanususal management style had attracted the attention of federal and state banking regulators the regulators questioned the managers methods of assessing and managing risk—that is the algorithms at the very base of capital ones success those algorithms helped capital one identify customers who were good credit risks and the company used its huge portfolio of credit options to woo those customers away from their original banks despite the fact that capital one had achieved an average  percent annual return on investments through the use of those algorithms the threat of federal investigation drove investors away in addition capital ones cfo david m willey was notified by the securities and exchange commission that he was being investigated for insider trading and he resigned soon afterwards although the federal investigators ultimately found nothing wrong with capital ones model of risk assessment company stock prices plummeted during the early months of  to about half their value of the previous year stock prices rebounded following the successful conclusion of the federal investigation however fairbank and morris saw this investigation as a sign that capital one had finally matured and should leave the ranks of brash startup companies and institute practices closer to those of older banks they adjusted by revamping capital ones decisionmaking structure in february  the pair announced that the company would be run by a team of executive decision makers led by fairbank rather than according to policies brainstormed by fairbank and morris on long car trips morris himself announced that he would leave the company on april   bringing to a close a partnership that had stretched back almost two decades see also entry on captial one financial corporation in international directory of company histories  sources for further information
