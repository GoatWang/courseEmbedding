cap value fund have similar investment objectives and substantially similar policies and risks both funds seek capital appreciation and dividend income although seeking current income is a secondary objective of new multi cap value fund applicants represent that both funds invest at least  of their respective net assets in common stocks of companies of any size employing a value style of investing and allow foreign securities preferred stocks convertible securities and derivatives to be used as principal strategies applicants assert that immaterial differences in risks and investment objectives and strategies exist but believe these differences do not introduce contractowners to materially greater risks after the substitutions  substitution procedure inkind transactions applicants assert that as of the effective date of the substitutions “substitution date” a portion of the securities of the old funds will be redeemed inkind and those securities received will be used to purchase shares of the new funds applicants assert that redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times they further represent that all redemptions of shares of the old portfolios and purchases of shares of the new portfolios will be effected will take place at relative net asset value determined on the substitution date in accordance with section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contractowners contract value cash value death benefit or dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  likewise section b applicants represent that i the new fund shares sold inkind will be of the type and quality that a new fund could have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of its shares had the shares been sold for cash and ii nfa and the relevant subadvisers will analyze the portfolio securities being offered to each relevant new fund and will retain only those securities that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction whether nfa or relevant subadviser of a new fund accepts or declines to accept a particular portfolio

contractowners will have the same or lower net operating expenses after the substitutions as prior to the substitutions  with respect to those who are contractowners on the substitution date applicants specifically represent the following on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour  months following the substitution date the insurance companies will reimburse those contractowners with contract value allocated to a subaccount corresponding to an new fund to the extent that for that period the new funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the old funds net operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses asset based fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for fiscal year   contract charges and benefits applicants represent that the insurance companies will not increase the contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the contracts for a period of at least two  years following the substitution date to the extent the contracts contain restrictions limitations or fees for transfers applicants represent such provisions will not apply in connection with the proposed substitutions and each substitution redemption and purchase will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of assessing transfer charges or computing the number of permissible transfers under the contracts applicants state that contractowners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or insurance benefits or the insurance companies obligations under the contracts be altered in any way applicants also affirm that the substitutions will not result in adverse tax consequences to contractowners and will not alter any tax benefits associated with the contracts  manager of managers order applicants further represent that after the substitution date the new funds will not change a subadviser add a new subadviser or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in subadviser the new subadviser or the funds ability add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on manager of managers order in addition before the substitutions applicants state that each contractowner will have been provided with a new portfolio prospectus describing the existence substance and effect of the manager of managers order  notice procedures applicants represent that prospectus supplements for the contracts will be delivered to contractowners at least thirty  days before the substitution

been filed to obtain the start printed page necessary orders to do so and indicate the anticipated substitution date ii advise contractowners that from the date of the supplement until the substitution date contractowners are permitted to transfer contract value out of any old fund subaccount to any other subaccounts offered under the contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees otherwise applicable under the terms of the contract iii instruct contractowners how to submit transfer requests in light of the proposed substitutions iv advise contractowners that any contract value remaining in an old fund subaccount on the substitution date will be transferred to the corresponding new fund subaccount and that the substitutions will take place at relative net asset value without charge including sales charges or surrender charges and without counting toward the number of transfers that may be permitted without charge v inform contractowners that for at least thirty  days following the substitution date the insurance companies will permit contractowners to make transfers of contract value out of each new fund subaccount to any other subaccounts offered under the contract without the transfer being treated as a transfer for purposes of transfer limitations and fees that would otherwise apply under the terms of the contract and vi inform contractowners that except as described in the market timing provision of the relevant prospectus the respective insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers out of a new fund for at least thirty  days after the substitution date  applicants also represent that i prior to the

new purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement contract prospectus and the prospectus andor supplement for the new funds in accordance with all applicable legal requirements and iii prospective contract purchasers will be provided the prospectus supplement and the contract prospectus applicants also represent that within five  business days after the substitution date contractowners will be sent a written confirmation of the substitutions which will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice applicants legal analysis  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act approving the substitutions  section c of the act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission approves the substitution the commission shall approve such a substitution if the evidence establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants state that the right to make such a substitution has been reserved under the contracts and is disclosed in the prospectus for the related contracts applicants declare that in all material respects each new fund and its corresponding old fund have similar substantially similar or identical investment objectives and strategies and that each proposed substitutions retains for contractowners the investment flexibility and expertise in asset management features of the contracts they assert that after the substitution date contractowners invested in a new fund will have the same or lower net operating expense ratios as before the substitution further applicants have agreed to certain expense limits to ensure affected contractowners do not incur higher expenses as a result of a substitution for a period of twenty four  months after the substitution  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and assert that replacement of the old portfolios with the new portfolios is consistent with the protection of contractowners and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act specifically they argue that the substitutions will not result in the type of costly forced redemption that section c was designed to prevent rather applicants conclude that “any impact on the investment programs of affected contractowners should be negligible” and affirm the substitutions will have no impact on other aspects of the contracts including the annuity life or tax benefits they afford affected contractowners  section b applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the  act exempting them from the provisions of section a of the  act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out the inkind substitution transactions “inkind transactions”  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principal from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company pursuant to section a of the act the section b applicants may be considered affiliates of one or more of the portfolios involved in the substitutions because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and subsequent purchases of shares and by means of inkind transactions the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliates  section b of the act provides that the commission may upon application grant an order exempting any transaction from the prohibitions of section a if the evidence establishes that the terms of the proposed transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned as recited in its registration statement and records filed under the act and the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act  based on the facts presented above section b applicants submit that the terms of the inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid and received are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching because i the contractowners contract values will not be adversely impacted or diluted and ii section b applicants agree to carry out the inkind transactions in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and the procedures adopted thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash thus section b applicants conclude that the purposes intended by implementation of the rule are met by the terms of the inkind transactions  in support of this position section b applicants assert that the proposed inkind transactions will be effected based upon the independent current market price of the portfolio start printed page securities as specified in rule ab and will include only securities for which market quotations are readily available on the substitution date in accordance with rule ac section b applicants assert that the proposed inkind transactions will be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company and separate series thereof participating in the inkind transactions as recited in the relevant registered investment companys registration statement and reports as specified in rule ad the application states that no brokerage commission fee except for any customary transfer fees or other remuneration will be paid in connection with the proposed inkind transactions likewise section b applicants represent that trusts board of trustees has adopted and implemented the fund governance and oversight procedures as required by rule ae and f the application also states “pursuant to rule ae during the calendar quarter following the quarter in which any inkind transactions occur the trusts board of trustees will review reports submitted by nfa in respect of such inkind transactions in order to determine that all such inkind transactions made during the preceding quarter were effected in accordance with the representations stated herein” finally applicants represent that a written record of the procedures for the proposed inkind transactions will be maintained and preserved in accordance with rule ag conclusions section  applicants submit that for the reasons summarized above the proposed substitutions meet the standards of section c of the  act and request that the commission issue an order of approval pursuant to section c of the  act section  applicants submit that the proposed inkind transactions meet the standards of section b of the  act and request that the commission issue an order of exemption pursuant to section b of the  act start signature for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated

nfn an affiliated distribution network that markets directly to its customer base nfs is incorporated in delaware and maintains its principal executive offices in columbus ohio the company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of its business the companys legal and regulatory matters include proceedings specific to the company and other proceedings generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which the company operates these matters are subject to many uncertainties and given their complexity and scope their outcomes cannot be predicted regulatory proceedings could also affect the outcome of one or more of the companys litigation matters furthermore it is often not possible to determine the ultimate outcomes of the pending regulatory investigations and legal proceedings or to provide reasonable ranges of potential losses with any degree of certainty some matters including certain of those referred to below are in very preliminary stages and the company does not have sufficient information to make an assessment of the plaintiffs claims for liability or damages in some of the cases seeking to be certified as class actions the court has not yet decided whether a class will be certified or in the event of certification the size of the class and class period in many of the cases the plaintiffs are seeking undefined amounts of damages or other relief including punitive damages and equitable remedies which are difficult to quantify and cannot be defined based on the information currently available the company believes however that based on currently known information the ultimate outcome of all pending legal and regulatory matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the companys condensed consolidated financial position nonetheless given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation it is possible that such outcomes could materially affect the companys condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations in a particular quarter or annual period the various businesses conducted by the company are subject to oversight by numerous federal and state regulatory entities including but not limited to the securities and exchange commission the financial industry regulatory authority the
