attention rathbone shares have climbed by  since ’s low in october to p including a resultsday p rise and have doubled in price over the past five years  the reason for that seems apparent from the company’s recent performance — we’ve seen earnings per share growing by  in just four years with analysts forecasting a further  gain by the time we reach december  while the company spoke of “ongoing geopolitical uncertainty” which is currently dominating shortterm market conditions we did see underlying pretax profit rise by  to £m in the first six months of the year funds the key longterm measure of confidence in an investment manger is its level of funds under management and we saw a  rise to £bn since december o — and seeing as the ftse  put on only  over the same period i’m impressed by that i would not place my own investment cash under the control of a professional manager purely because i think my own simple strategy is effective enough without paying anyone else to do it for me but there are many from private investors to charities and pension funds who need the services of companies like rathbone — and i reckon buying shares in investment managers themselves can be very rewarding i see what might be thought of as contrarian safety here too — it’s when markets are at their most volatile that people turn more to respected professionals to manage their cash  and i see rathbone brothers as a wellmanaged and wellrespected firm that should continue to do well corporate finance financial services at all levels can be very profitable and i’ve also been examining intermediate capital group lse icp the company provides capital for a variety of corporate needs including ipo management buyouts and similar the first quarter of this year has been pretty good with inflows in the period of €bn coupled with “robust demand for current fundraising“ the firm did see a  drop in funds under management to €bn in the three months but it put that down to an “expected quieter quarter” and an adverse currency exchange impact on dollardenominated funds among other things but inflows in the second quarter are expected to be higher outgoing chief executive christophe evain said “our expectation continues that this will be a strong fundraising year” and that supports expectations of a good year this year one for the brave intermediate capital is in a volatile sector and that can show through in erratic share price movements but one thing i see as a longterm calming effect is the company’s progressive dividend it’s grown from p per share in  to p this year and though an impressive share price performance over that timescale has dropped the yield to  we’re also looking at a trailing pe of under  dividend cover is strong and i expect to see yields increasing nicely over time if you’re happy to handle shortterm volatility without panicking which i see as an essential characteristic of a growth investor i really do see intermediate capital group as having solid longterm potential big money from growth shares growth shares like these can be very profitable and the tempting pick uncovered in our top growth share from the motley fool report has been raking in the cash for years the past five years have brought in doubledigit annual earnings growth and the citys experts are predicting two more years of solid growth ahead of us

management panel up  from the £ billion at  december  and  advisers up from  at  december  the business remains on track to grow to our target of  advisers and we remain confident in its growth prospects our distribution strategy continues to focus on promoting our discretionary investment management services to professional intermediaries principally national and regional ifa networks it continues to make good progress with net flows of £ million in the first six months of the year up  from £ million at the same time last year we continue to build our presence in the intermediary market as evidenced by a may  defaqto report which confirmed that the usage of rathbones as a discretionary fund management provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year and  placed rathbones very highly in the critical areas of  quality of investment staff and service we successfully launched an execution only managed portfolio service in march  which attracted £ million of net flows in its first  months of launch with the credit suisse partnership fully operational the rathbone private office was formally launched in january the nucleus team of three senior client advisers and four support staff is making good progress in promoting this new advisory capability this service is offered directly to super high net worth clients and family offices as well as seeking introductions from the professional intermediary market and from our own investment manager community the team has already engaged its first clients and is developing an encouraging pipeline of prospective clients for the full year  we continue to focus on improving our client experience and striving for greater operational efficiency in our support functions with the aim of creating additional capacity for growth at the full year we outlined our plans to spend an additional £ million in  to implement a new client relationship management system and improve our client take on processes these plans are developing more quickly than originally planned and in light of more favourable investment conditions we have chosen to bring forward capital expenditure originally planned for  to the second half of this year in order to accelerate delivery and improve functionality through greater automation this brings the total expected capital expenditure in relation to our client relationship management system and client take on process improvement to approximately £ million in  expenditure on the other growth strategies remains in line with expectations the relocation of our london head office to  finsbury circus has proved very successful  financial position and regulatory capital shareholders equity of £ million at  june  increased  since  december  £ million and  since  june  £ million this is largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations which totalled £ million at  june   lower than the £ million recorded at  december  this reflected a high number of members transferring their benefits out of the scheme a reduction in the assumed rates of improvement in longevity and breakage of the link between pension entitlements and final salaries triennial valuation discussions with trustees are ongoing and are expected to complete in the second half of the year  total assets at  june  were £ million  december  £ million  june  £ million of which £ million  december  £ million  june  £ million represents the cash element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit as a result of these higher levels of cash balances with central banks increased from £ million at  december  to £ million at  june   june  £ million our consolidated common equity tier  ratio was   at  june   december    june   our consolidated leverage ratio was  at  june   december    june   the capital surplus of own funds over the pillar  and a requirements and crd iv buffers was £m at  june  excluding year to date post tax profits and improvements in the value of retirement benefit obligations compared to £m at  june  largely reflecting the impact of additional equity raised in october  offset by higher capital requirements business risks the board believes that the nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the groups performance during the remainder of its financial year remain unchanged from those identified in the strategic report and group risk committee report in our  annual report and accounts pages  and pages  respectively  regulatory changes  we continue to prepare for the changes brought on by mifid ii and the general data protection regime and are working hard to ensure our people and systems are compliant we anticipate that the cost of these projects will be approximately £ million which will be absorbed by our normal expenditure budget for the year we note the recommendations of the recent fca asset management market report and the sequence of consultations prior to final implementation while we broadly welcome the proposals they will have an impact on margins of our unit trust business from  in addition as part of our implementation of mifid ii research payments that have long been charged to our funds will from  january  be borne by the business the impact of these changes will be significantly offset by a reduction in variable remuneration some cost actions and by the continued funds growth momentum through this year and beyond fund box profits in our unit trust business for the six months ended  june  were £ million and research costs currently borne by the funds totalled approximately £ million for the same period  board and senior management changes following the announcement of david harrel stepping down after nine years on the board we are pleased to announce that sarah gentleman has now completed the regulatory approval process and has formally succeeded david as the chairman of the remuneration committee outlook the first six months of  has seen another busy period for rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service

basis of preparation rathbone brothers plc the company is the parent company of a group of companies the group that provides personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients charities and trustees the group also provides financial planning private banking offshore fund management and trust administration services the products and services from which the group derives its revenues are described in our services on page  of the annual report and accounts for the year ended  december  and have not materially changed since that date these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with ias  interim financial reporting as adopted by the eu the condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the accounting policies methods of computation and presentation set out in the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  except as disclosed below the condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the groups audited financial statements for the year ended  december  which are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the eu the information in this announcement does not comprise statutory financial statements within the meaning of section  of the companies act  the comparative figures for the financial year ended  december  are not the groups statutory accounts for that financial year the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  have been reported on by its auditors and delivered to the registrar of companies the report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis it also did not contain a statement under section  of the companies act  developments in reporting standards and interpretations future new standards and interpretations a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after  january  and therefore have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements ifrs  financial instruments ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers and ifrs  leases are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group ifrs  financial instruments ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group has not adopted this standard early ifrs  changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent of credit provisioning the group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact based on the profile of its financial instruments as at the balance sheet date and is well advanced in its approach to classification and valuation classification of financial assets the basis of classification for financial assets under ifrs  is different from that under ias  financial assets will be classified into one of three categories amortised cost fair value through profit or loss fvtpl or fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci the held to maturity loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under ias  have been removed in addition the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under ifrs  the group is well advanced in its classification of financial assets under the new standard ifrs  uses the same measurement bases as ias  and the group has not yet identified any material differences arising from applying the new standard debt securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified as amortised cost other assets currently carried at amortised cost such as cash with central banks and loans and advances to banks and customers will also continue to be classified as such money market funds currently classified as available for sale will be classified as fvoci given that although they are generally held to collect contractual cash flows they can be redeemed should the need arise impairment of financial assets under ifrs  an expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses a provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the groups financial assets under ias  credit losses are recognised when they incurred under the expected credit loss model a dual measurement approach applies whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal to either  month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses the latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the credit quality of the asset this will require considerable judgement as to how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses which will be determined on a probabilityweighted basis the groups trade receivables including trust and financial planning debtors are generally short term and does not contain significant financing components therefore the group expects to apply the simplified approach and reflect lifetime expected credit losses treasury assets currently held by the group are of high credit quality and the group has not experienced any historical credit losses in its treasury or loan portfolios work conducted to date suggests that any impairment charges recognised in the financial statements under the new standard will be minimal classification of financial liabilities the basis of classification for financial liabilities under ifrs  remains unchanged from that under ias  the two categories are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss either designated as such or held for trading the group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and do not anticipate doing so therefore under ifrs  the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost with no material impact on measurement ifrs   revenue from contracts with customers ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group has not adopted this standard early ifrs  changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers the group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether how much and when revenue is recognised the group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard based on its existing revenue streams in addition the group is considering the impact on its policy of capitalising costs to secure investment management contracts net fee and commission income included within net fee and commission income are initial fees charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities under ifrs  the group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and therefore fulfils any performance obligations if so then these fees can be recognised when charged if not then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided the group has not yet identified any other revenue streams that will be materially impacted by the new standard client relationship intangibles where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts such costs are capitalised and amortised where they are separable reliably measurable and expected to be recovered under ias  ifrs  reinforces this view stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs therefore the group does not believe the adoption of ifrs  will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles transition the group plans to adopt ifrs  in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending  december  using the retrospective approach ifrs   leases ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group does not plan to adopt this standard early ifrs  eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases the group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than  months as a rightofuse lease asset on its balance sheet the group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments the group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact of adopting the standard based on its existing lease contracts the most significant impact is in respect of its new london head office premises transition definition of a lease on transition to ifrs  the group can choose whether to  apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if ifrs  had always applied or  apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments of which contracts contain a lease the group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to contain a lease prior to the date of adoption retrospective approach as a lessee the group can either apply the standard using a  retrospective approach or  modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients the group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts and is most likely to apply the modified retrospective approach potential impact the groups total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities the lease assets will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term the lease liability will be reduced by lease payments offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term on the groups statement of comprehensive income the profile of lease costs will be frontloaded at least individually as the interest charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds the total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged in addition to the above impacts recognition of lease assets will increase the groups regulatory capital requirement lessor accounting where the group acts as an intermediate lessor in a sublease arrangement it will need to make adjustments for such leases      segmental information for management purposes the group is organised into two operating divisions investment management and unit trusts centrally incurred

principally national and regional ifa networks it continues to make good progress with net flows of £ million in the first six months of the year up  from £ million at the same time last year we continue to build our presence in the intermediary market as evidenced by a may  defaqto report which confirmed that the usage of rathbones as a discretionary fund management provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year and  placed rathbones very highly in the critical areas of  quality of investment staff and service we successfully launched an execution only managed portfolio service in march  which attracted £ million of net flows in its first  months of launch with the credit suisse partnership fully operational the rathbone private office was formally launched in january the nucleus team of three senior client advisers and four support staff is making good progress in promoting this new advisory capability this service is offered directly to super high net worth clients and family offices as well as seeking introductions from the professional intermediary market and from our own investment manager community the team has already engaged its first clients and is developing an encouraging pipeline of prospective clients for the full year  we continue to focus on improving our client experience and striving for greater operational efficiency in our support functions with the aim of creating additional capacity for growth at the full year we outlined our plans to spend an additional £ million in  to implement a new client relationship management system and improve our client take on processes these plans are developing more quickly than originally planned and in light of more favourable investment conditions we have chosen to bring forward capital expenditure originally planned for  to the second half of this year in order to accelerate delivery and improve functionality through greater automation this brings the total expected capital expenditure in relation to our client relationship management system and client take on process improvement to approximately £ million in  expenditure on the other growth strategies remains in line with expectations the relocation of our london head office to  finsbury circus has proved very successful  financial position and regulatory capital shareholders equity of £ million at  june  increased  since  december  £ million and  since  june  £ million this is largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations which totalled £ million at  june   lower than the £ million recorded at  december  this reflected a high number of members transferring their benefits out of the scheme a reduction in the assumed rates of improvement in longevity and breakage of the link between pension entitlements and final salaries triennial valuation discussions with trustees are ongoing and are expected to complete in the second half of the year  total assets at  june  were £ million  december  £ million  june  £ million of which £ million  december  £ million  june  £ million represents the cash element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit as a result

year to date post tax profits and improvements in the value of retirement benefit obligations compared to £m at  june  largely reflecting the impact of additional equity raised in october  offset by higher capital requirements business risks the board believes that the nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the groups performance during the remainder of its financial year remain unchanged from those identified in the strategic report and group risk committee report in our  annual report and accounts pages  and pages  respectively  regulatory changes  we continue to prepare for the changes brought on by mifid ii and the general data protection regime and are working hard to ensure our people and systems are compliant we anticipate that the cost of these projects will be approximately £ million which will be absorbed by our normal expenditure budget for the year we note the recommendations of the recent fca asset management market report and the sequence of consultations prior to final implementation while we broadly welcome the proposals they will have an impact on margins of our unit trust business from  in addition as part of our implementation of mifid ii research payments that have long been charged to our funds will from  january  be borne by the business the impact of these changes will be significantly offset by a reduction in variable remuneration some cost actions and by the continued funds growth momentum through this year and beyond fund box profits in our unit trust business for the six months ended  june  were £ million and research costs currently borne by the funds totalled approximately £ million for the same period  board and senior management changes following the announcement of david harrel

basis of preparation rathbone brothers plc the company is the parent company of a group of companies the group that provides personalised investment and wealth management services for private clients charities and trustees the group also provides financial planning private banking offshore fund management and trust administration services the products and services from which the group derives its revenues are described in our services on page  of the annual report and accounts for the year ended  december  and have not materially changed since that date these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with ias  interim financial reporting as adopted by the eu the condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the accounting policies methods of computation and presentation set out in the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  except as disclosed below the condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the groups audited financial statements for the year ended  december  which are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the eu the information in this announcement does not comprise statutory financial statements within the meaning of section  of the companies act  the comparative figures for the financial year ended  december  are not the groups statutory accounts for that financial year the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  have been reported on by its auditors and delivered to the registrar of companies the report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis it also did not contain a statement under section  of the companies act  developments in reporting standards and interpretations future new standards and interpretations a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after  january  and therefore have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements ifrs  financial instruments ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers and ifrs  leases are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group ifrs  financial instruments ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group has not adopted this standard early ifrs  changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent of credit provisioning the group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact based on the profile of its financial instruments as at the balance sheet date and is well advanced in its approach to classification and valuation classification of financial assets the basis of classification for financial assets under ifrs  is different from that under ias  financial assets will be classified into one of three categories amortised cost fair value through profit or loss fvtpl or fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci the held to maturity loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under ias  have been removed in addition the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under ifrs  the group is well advanced in its classification of financial assets under the new standard ifrs  uses the same measurement bases as ias  and the group has not yet identified any material differences arising from applying the new standard debt securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified as amortised cost other assets currently carried at amortised cost such as cash with central banks and loans and advances to banks and customers will also continue to be classified as such money market funds currently classified as available for sale will be classified as fvoci given that although they are generally held to collect contractual cash flows they can be redeemed should the need arise impairment of financial assets under ifrs  an expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses a provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the groups financial assets under ias  credit losses are recognised when they incurred under the expected credit loss model a dual measurement approach applies whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal to either  month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses the latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the credit quality of the asset this will require considerable judgement as to how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses which will be determined on a probabilityweighted basis the groups trade receivables including trust and financial planning debtors are generally short term and does not contain significant financing components therefore the group expects to apply the simplified approach and reflect lifetime expected credit losses treasury assets currently held by the group are of high credit quality and the group has not experienced any historical credit losses in its treasury or loan portfolios work conducted to date suggests that any impairment charges recognised in the financial statements under the new standard will be minimal classification of financial liabilities the basis of classification for financial liabilities under ifrs  remains unchanged from that under ias  the two categories are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss either designated as such or held for trading the group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and do not anticipate doing so therefore under ifrs  the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost with no material impact on measurement ifrs   revenue from contracts with customers ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group has not adopted this standard early ifrs  changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers the group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether how much and when revenue is recognised the group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard based on its existing revenue streams in addition the group is considering the impact on its policy of capitalising costs to secure investment management contracts net fee and commission income included within net fee and commission income are initial fees charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities under ifrs  the group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and therefore fulfils any performance obligations if so then these fees can be recognised when charged if not then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided the group has not yet identified any other revenue streams that will be materially impacted by the new standard client relationship intangibles where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts such costs are capitalised and amortised where they are separable reliably measurable and expected to be recovered under ias  ifrs  reinforces this view stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs therefore the group does not believe the adoption of ifrs  will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles transition the group plans to adopt ifrs  in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending  december  using the retrospective approach ifrs   leases ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group does not plan to adopt this standard early ifrs  eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases the group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than  months as a rightofuse lease asset on its balance sheet the group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments the group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact of adopting the standard based on its existing lease contracts the most significant impact is in respect of its new london head office premises transition definition of a lease on transition to ifrs  the group can choose whether to  apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if ifrs  had always applied or  apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments of which contracts contain a lease the group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to contain a lease prior to the date of adoption retrospective approach as a lessee the group can either apply the standard using a  retrospective approach or  modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients the group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts and is most likely to apply the modified retrospective approach potential impact the groups total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities the lease assets will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term the lease liability will be reduced by lease payments offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term on the groups statement of comprehensive income the profile of lease costs will be frontloaded at least individually as the interest charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds the total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged in addition to the above impacts recognition of lease assets will increase the groups regulatory capital requirement lessor accounting where the group acts as an intermediate lessor in a sublease arrangement it will need to make adjustments for such leases      segmental information for management purposes the group is organised into two operating divisions investment management and unit trusts centrally incurred

interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity issued by the auditing practices board for use in the united kingdom a review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review procedures a review is substantially less in scope than an audit

tradingthe board of rathbones has announced this morning the companys trading update for the three months ended  september  which demonstrates positive momentum in its business with funds under management up  in the quarter supported by favourable investment markets net organic and acquired growth in investment management and strong net inflows in unit trusts further details of this trading update are contained in the separate announcement released this morning pensions reviewfurther to the announcement made in the groups interim results in july the board has concluded its review of the companys two defined benefit pension schemes the db schemes and in particular the larger rathbone  scheme the  scheme which remains open to future service accrual during  the combined deficit in the db schemes has risen significantly mainly driven by the valuation of scheme liabilities based on yields on long term corporate bonds those yields which have been falling since the financial crisis reduced significantly during the year and in particular since the outcome of the uk referendum on its membership of the eu on  june  prior to this the increase in the db schemes liabilities was broadly matched by company contributions and the growth of assets in the schemes by way of illustration the combined halfyearly ias  funding position of the db schemes fluctuated between a £m deficit and a £m surplus between  and  and stood at a modest deficit of £m at  december   the groups recent interim results showed a deficit of £m as at  june  and this rose further to £m in the three months to  september  changes in the level of the db schemes deficits under ias directly impact the groups regulatory capital resources and the companys distributable reserves an elevated deficit position also constrains the groups strategic flexibility the board has therefore resolved to take action to mitigate the situation in particular it has engaged with the  schemes trustees and plans to consult with affected employees with respect to proposals to cap pensionable salaries and to close the scheme for future service accrual with effect from july  whilst the laurence keen scheme the lk scheme is already closed to future accrual the board will also consult with those affected employees who are members of the lk scheme with respect to a proposal to cap pensionable salaries with effect from july  the consultation processes will last for a minimum period of  days although ultimate resolution may take longer the board will update the market on the progress of the consultation processes in due course whilst implementing these proposed actions is expected to generate a higher regulatory capital requirement in the nearterm the board expects this to be more than outweighed by the following key benefits over the life of the db schemes a reduction in the combined ias deficit of the db schemes and therefore the companys exposure to its future volatilitya reduction in ongoing required contributions and service costs associated with the db schemes and a reduction in the rate of growth of regulatory capital required to support the db schemes the placingthe board has therefore decided to undertake a placing of  of the issued share capital to raise gross proceeds of approximately £ million primarily to fund the nearterm capital requirement and also to provide a measure of additional financial flexibility the funds raised will remain on the company balance sheet to be applied as the board sees fit it is not anticipated that there will be any immediate incremental contribution to the db schemes the board considers the proposed actions including the placing to be appropriate to address the current situation and reduce future risks nonetheless it is possible that further actions will be required in the future as the company will remain exposed to ongoing uncertainties related to the deficit position of the db schemes including i further possible corporate bond yield compression ii the outcome of the engagement with the trustees the consultation with the db scheme members and the next triennial valuation of the db schemes which will be carried out based on the financial position as at  december  iii the resultant level of contributions required to address the deficit position in the future and iv any regulatory capital implications associated with the above that might arise commenting on the proposed actions philip howell chief executive officer saidrathbones has continued to perform well despite challenging industry conditions we have conducted a review of our defined benefit pension arrangements in the context of the rising costs associated with our pension schemes we concluded we needed to take the actions we have announced today and look forward to engaging successfully with the trustees and our affected employees the capital raising will enable us to progress these actions and support our continued future growth placing detailsthe company

should continue to do well corporate finance financial services at all levels can be very profitable and i’ve also been examining intermediate capital group lse icp the company provides capital for a variety of corporate needs including ipo management buyouts and similar the first quarter of this year has been pretty good with inflows in the period of €bn coupled with “robust demand for current fundraising“ the firm did see a  drop in funds under management to €bn in the three months but it put that down to an “expected quieter quarter” and an adverse currency exchange impact on dollardenominated funds among other things but inflows in the second quarter are expected to be higher outgoing chief executive christophe evain said “our expectation continues that this will be a strong fundraising year” and that supports expectations of a good year this year one for the brave intermediate capital is in a volatile sector and that can show through in erratic share price movements but one thing i see as a longterm calming effect is the company’s progressive dividend it’s grown from p per share in  to p this year and though an impressive share price performance over that timescale has dropped the yield to  we’re also looking at a trailing pe of under  dividend cover is strong and i expect to see yields increasing nicely over time if you’re happy to handle shortterm volatility without panicking which i see as an essential characteristic of a growth investor i really do see intermediate capital group as having solid longterm potential big money

management panel up  from the £ billion at  december  and  advisers up from  at  december  the business remains on track to grow to our target of  advisers and we remain confident in its growth prospects our distribution strategy continues to focus on promoting our discretionary investment management services to professional intermediaries principally national and regional ifa networks it continues to make good progress with net flows of £ million in the first six months of the year up  from £ million at the same time last year we continue to build our presence in the intermediary market as evidenced by a may  defaqto report which confirmed that the usage of rathbones as a discretionary fund management provider to advisers had more than doubled in the last year and  placed rathbones very highly in the critical areas of  quality of investment staff and service we successfully launched an execution only managed portfolio service in march  which attracted £ million of net flows in its first  months of launch with the credit suisse partnership fully operational the rathbone private office was formally launched in january the nucleus team of three senior client advisers and four support staff is making good progress in promoting this new advisory capability this service is offered directly to super high net worth clients and family offices as well as seeking introductions from the professional intermediary market and from our own investment manager community the team has already engaged its first clients and is developing an encouraging pipeline of prospective clients for the full year  we continue to focus on improving our client experience and striving for greater operational efficiency in our support functions with the aim of creating additional capacity for growth at the full year we outlined our plans to spend an additional £ million in  to implement a new client relationship management system and improve our client take on processes these plans are developing more quickly than originally planned and in light of more favourable investment conditions we have chosen to bring forward capital expenditure originally planned for  to the second half of this year in order to accelerate delivery and improve functionality through greater automation this brings the total expected capital expenditure in relation to our client relationship management system and client take on process improvement to approximately £ million in  expenditure on the other growth strategies remains in line with expectations the relocation of our london head office to  finsbury circus has proved very successful  financial position and regulatory capital shareholders equity of £ million at  june  increased  since  december  £ million and  since  june  £ million this is largely as a result of the fall in value of retirement benefit obligations which totalled £ million at  june   lower than the £ million recorded at  december  this reflected a high number of members transferring their benefits out of the scheme a reduction in the assumed rates of improvement in longevity and breakage of the link between pension entitlements and final salaries triennial valuation discussions with trustees are ongoing and are expected to complete in the second half of the year  total assets at  june  were £ million  december  £ million  june  £ million of which £ million  december  £ million  june  £ million represents the cash element of client portfolios that is held as a banking deposit as a result of these higher levels of cash balances with central banks increased from £ million at  december  to £ million at  june   june  £ million our consolidated common equity tier  ratio was   at  june   december    june   our consolidated leverage ratio was  at  june   december    june   the capital surplus of own funds over the pillar  and a requirements and crd iv buffers was £m at  june  excluding year to date post tax profits and improvements in the value of retirement benefit obligations compared to £m at  june  largely reflecting the impact of additional equity raised in october  offset by higher capital requirements business risks the board believes that the nature of the principal risks and uncertainties which may have a material effect on the groups performance during the remainder of its financial year remain unchanged from those identified in the strategic report and group risk committee report in our  annual report and accounts pages  and pages  respectively  regulatory changes  we continue to prepare for the changes brought on by mifid ii and the general data protection regime and are working hard to ensure our people and systems are compliant we anticipate that the cost of these projects will be approximately £ million which will be absorbed by our normal expenditure budget for the year we note the recommendations of the recent fca asset management market report and the sequence of consultations prior to final implementation while we broadly welcome the proposals they will have an impact on margins of our unit trust business from  in addition as part of our implementation of mifid ii research payments that have long been charged to our funds will from  january  be borne by the business the impact of these changes will be significantly offset by a reduction in variable remuneration some cost actions and by the continued funds growth momentum through this year and beyond fund box profits in our unit trust business for the six months ended  june  were £ million and research costs currently borne by the funds totalled approximately £ million for the same period  board and senior management changes following the announcement of david harrel stepping down after nine years on the board we are pleased to announce that sarah gentleman has now completed the regulatory approval process and has formally succeeded david as the chairman of the remuneration committee outlook the first six months of  has seen another busy period for rathbones as we continue to deliver our strategic plans without detracting from our high standards of service

ended  december  and have not materially changed since that date these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are presented in accordance with ias  interim financial reporting as adopted by the eu the condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis using the accounting policies methods of computation and presentation set out in the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  except as disclosed below the condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the groups audited financial statements for the year ended  december  which are prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards ifrs as adopted by the eu the information in this announcement does not comprise statutory financial statements within the meaning of section  of the companies act  the comparative figures for the financial year ended  december  are not the groups statutory accounts for that financial year the groups financial statements for the year ended  december  have been reported on by its auditors and delivered to the registrar of companies the report of the auditors on those financial statements was unqualified and did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis it also did not contain a statement under section  of the companies act  developments in reporting standards and interpretations future new standards and interpretations a number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations will be effective for future annual periods beginning after  january  and therefore have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements ifrs  financial instruments ifrs  revenue from contracts with customers and ifrs  leases are expected to have the most significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the group ifrs  financial instruments ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group has not adopted this standard early ifrs  changes the classification and measurement of financial instruments and the timing and extent of credit provisioning the group has conducted a preliminary assessment of the potential impact based on the profile of its financial instruments as at the balance sheet date and is well advanced in its approach to classification and valuation classification of financial assets the basis of classification for financial assets under ifrs  is different from that under ias  financial assets will be classified into one of three categories amortised cost fair value through profit or loss fvtpl or fair value through other comprehensive income fvoci the held to maturity loans and receivables and available for sale categories available under ias  have been removed in addition the classification criteria for allocating financial assets between categories are different under ifrs  the group is well advanced in its classification of financial assets under the new standard ifrs  uses the same measurement bases as ias  and the group has not yet identified any material differences arising from applying the new standard debt securities currently classified as held to maturity will be classified as amortised cost other assets currently carried at amortised cost such as cash with central banks and loans and advances to banks and customers will also continue to be classified as such money market funds currently classified as available for sale will be classified as fvoci given that although they are generally held to collect contractual cash flows they can be redeemed should the need arise impairment of financial assets under ifrs  an expected credit loss model replaces the incurred loss model meaning there no longer needs to be a triggering event in order to recognise impairment losses a provision must be made for the amount of any loss expected to arise over the life of the groups financial assets under ias  credit losses are recognised when they incurred under the expected credit loss model a dual measurement approach applies whereby a financial asset will attract a loss allowance equal to either  month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses the latter applies if there has been a significant deterioration in the credit quality of the asset this will require considerable judgement as to how changes in economic factors affect expected credit losses which will be determined on a probabilityweighted basis the groups trade receivables including trust and financial planning debtors are generally short term and does not contain significant financing components therefore the group expects to apply the simplified approach and reflect lifetime expected credit losses treasury assets currently held by the group are of high credit quality and the group has not experienced any historical credit losses in its treasury or loan portfolios work conducted to date suggests that any impairment charges recognised in the financial statements under the new standard will be minimal classification of financial liabilities the basis of classification for financial liabilities under ifrs  remains unchanged from that under ias  the two categories are amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss either designated as such or held for trading the group does not currently designate any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and do not anticipate doing so therefore under ifrs  the group expects to classify all financial liabilities as amortised cost with no material impact on measurement ifrs   revenue from contracts with customers ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group has not adopted this standard early ifrs  changes how and when revenue is recognised from contracts with customers the group will be required to identify all contracts it has with customers in order to determine whether how much and when revenue is recognised the group is in the process of quantifying the potential impact of adopting the standard based on its existing revenue streams in addition the group is considering the impact on its policy of capitalising costs to secure investment management contracts net fee and commission income included within net fee and commission income are initial fees charged by a number of group companies in relation to certain business activities under ifrs  the group will be required to make an assessment as to whether the work performed to earn such fees constitutes the transfer of services and therefore fulfils any performance obligations if so then these fees can be recognised when charged if not then the fees can only be recognised in the period the services are provided the group has not yet identified any other revenue streams that will be materially impacted by the new standard client relationship intangibles where payments are made to new investment managers to secure investment management contracts such costs are capitalised and amortised where they are separable reliably measurable and expected to be recovered under ias  ifrs  reinforces this view stating that incremental costs of obtaining any contract with a customer shall be capitalised if the entity expects to recover those costs therefore the group does not believe the adoption of ifrs  will materially change the way it accounts for client relationship intangibles transition the group plans to adopt ifrs  in its consolidated financial statements for the year ending  december  using the retrospective approach ifrs   leases ifrs  is effective for periods commencing on or after  january  the standard was endorsed by the eu during  the group does not plan to adopt this standard early ifrs  eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases the group will be required to recognise all leases with a term of more than  months as a rightofuse lease asset on its balance sheet the group will also recognise a financial liability representing its obligation to make future lease payments the group has conducted an initial quantification of the impact of adopting the standard based on its existing lease contracts the most significant impact is in respect of its new london head office premises transition definition of a lease on transition to ifrs  the group can choose whether to  apply the new definition of a lease to all its contracts as if ifrs  had always applied or  apply a practical expedient and retain its previous assessments of which contracts contain a lease the group intends to apply the practical expedient and therefore will not be reassessing those contracts that are not deemed to contain a lease prior to the date of adoption retrospective approach as a lessee the group can either apply the standard using a  retrospective approach or  modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients the group has assessed the impact of both approaches in relation to its existing lease contracts and is most likely to apply the modified retrospective approach potential impact the groups total assets and total liabilities will be increased by the recognition of lease assets and liabilities the lease assets will be depreciated over the shorter of the expected life of the asset and the lease term the lease liability will be reduced by lease payments offset by the unwinding of the liability over the lease term on the groups statement of comprehensive income the profile of lease costs will be frontloaded at least individually as the interest charge is higher in the early years of a lease term as the discount rate unwinds the total cost of the lease over the lease term is expected to be unchanged in addition to the above impacts recognition of lease assets will increase the groups regulatory capital requirement lessor accounting where the group acts as an intermediate lessor in a sublease arrangement it will need to make adjustments for such leases      segmental information for management purposes the group is organised into
