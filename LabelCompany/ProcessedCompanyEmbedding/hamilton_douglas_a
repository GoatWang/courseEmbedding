and in the mahratta and pindari wars – including the capture of jubbulpore in  military careeredit in  douglas hamilton went to the east india companys addiscombe military seminary and received his commission in the east india companys army in  being gazetted to the st regiment of the madras native infantry he embarked at portsmouth in the duke of argyle on  september of the same year arriving in the madras roads on  december his regiment was sent to kulladghee in the bombay presidency to replace one which had gone to the front in the first afghan campaign in  he went with his regiment to singapore and was fortunate to obtain three months leave in  to visit the island of java for hunting in  he visited england on furlough and returned to india in  douglas was very interested in forest conservation in south india and often visited his old friend general james michael who was organizing an experimental forest conservancy in the annaimalai hills he was appointed to temporarily manage the conservancy when michael returned to england on sick leave in  he showed great aptitude for these new forestry duties in  michael was again ill and had to relinquish the work altogether douglas succeeded permanently to the appointment and for the three years was in charge of the annaimalai forests supplying teak lumber for shipbuilding at the bombay dockyard during this period he also became assistant conservator of forests under dr hugh francis cleghorn who established the madras forest department and whose work led to the establishment of the forest department of india in  he went with

accompanied by a survey article describing all aspects of the district some of his publications about these surveys include berijam swamp was first described in  by hamilton in  hamilton submitted a report that stated that the berijam lake area was the best site in the palani hills for a military cantonment or sanatorium hamilton described the place as being located near a lake as the report progressed however it became clear that what hamilton initially had termed a lake was no such thing it was a valley where he thought he detected evidence of an ancient lake bed the distinction seemed scarcely worthy of note to hamilton so persuaded was he that this location offered the most picturesque environment for a settlement let but the lake be reconstructed and a road made to it and this magnificent sheet of water    will of itself attract residents to its vicinity the fort hamilton military outpost later built there was named for him in march  he went to the budan hills for the

departure is universal we may truly state that he has legitimately shot more game on these hills than any other sportsman and a sight of the trophies that adorn the walls of his house of the sketches and incidents of the chase and the relation thereof was a rich treat and one never again to be experienced from  to  he annually rented a moor and deer forest in scotland for the purpose of following his favorite pursuit of deer stalking and many a grand stag fell to his rifle the invigorating air of the highlands restored his health and strength his last leopard  feb  he never appeared to suffer

early life and workedit manyaraedit at the age of  douglashamilton moved to tanzania to live in the wild in lake manyara national park where he carried out the first scientific study of the social interactions of the african elephant from that study came his hypothesis rooted in behavioural ecology that elephant movements could hold the key to understanding their reactions to their changing environments douglashamilton argues that collecting and analysing large amounts of data on elephant locations and migrations can lead to insights into their choices and therefore assist in their protection against rising threats including poaching and humanwildlife conflict counting elephantsedit douglashamilton initially developed techniques to monitor widespread elephant movements from the air in the early s he designed study methods that would allow for comprehensive and replicable surveys of elephant families from lowflying aircraft which would at the same time allow large population counts to be undertaken for the first time between  and  douglashamilton worked on a joint iucn wwf elephant survey and conservation programme which surveyed african elephant populations in  countries to produce scientific data to help shape policy recommendations for the species protection around the same time working for iucn douglashamilton undertook research to map out the scale of the world ivory trade its value and its regulations meanwhile he continued to direct aerial surveys of elephant populations into the s including in uganda tanzania and the central african republic the elephant holocaust and the international ivory trade banedit douglashamiltons aerial surveys coupled with research coming from other studies began to show for the first time the scale of the poaching crisis that was sweeping africa during the s and s as demand for ivory from asia in particular from japan grew from  to  douglashamilton was made honorary chief park warden and antipoaching advisor to ugandas national parks authority there he designed air and ground patrols against poachers many from sudan where civil war was raging and poached elephant ivory could be sold to raise money to buy weapons on occasion douglashamilton was shot at as he carried out his work his work in uganda helped to stem the loss of elephants to poachers and allowed him to highlight the potential ways that poachers could be stopped in other parts of africa using the methods he developed in uganda douglashamiltons estimates drawn from his research and that of others suggested that the minimum population of african elephants across the continent of  million individuals in  had been reduced to less than half or around  elephants by  these statistics illustrated to the world the scale of what became known as the elephant holocaust regulation of the trade was attempted via the convention on the international trade in endangered species but eventually it was globally accepted that a ban should be enforced to stem the loss of illegally killed elephants douglashamilton was among africas leading conservationists who argued for this position it is widely accepted that the ban worked and elephant populations especially savannah populations began to recover save the elephantsedit the first  years of douglashamiltons work had illustrated that close scientific study of elephant populations coupled with surveys of their ranges and movements could help to mould policies that could protect them from external changes to build on this work in  douglashamilton founded save the elephants a charity registered in the uk and headquartered in nairobi with its main research station in samburu national reserve in northern kenya its mission is to secure a future for elephants by preserving the environments in which the animals live and encouraging a tolerant relationship between elephant and human populations httpsavetheelephantsorgabout collection of scientific data continues to drive douglashamilton’s work with save the elephants both with the aerial surveys that he pioneered early in his career and increasingly with modern technology including tracking collared elephants by gps and satellites save the elephants has since its formation been studying herds resident or migratory to samburu national reserve – a cohort of roughly  individuals hundreds of elephants have been
