approach biopharmx corporation was created to fulfill the unmet medical needs of people worldwide to achieve that we take a disciplined approach to research and product development our scientists researchers marketers and other team members are mission driven committed to producing novel treatments to cure intractable medical conditions we focus exclusively on dermatological issues and women’s health we seek to develop therapeutic products that provide unique solutions to common medical problems in these areas our approach is to create novel mechanisms to deliver effective treatments for persistent and often debilitating conditions in dermatology for example we are developing a unique way to deliver acnefighting medicine topically today’s most effective acne medications must be ingested risking undesirable sideeffects topical treatments tend to be ineffective because their formulations do not deliver medication to the layer of skin where acne forms our developmental topical called bpx effectively delivers small amounts of antibiotic to the acne source maximizing treatment effectiveness and reducing sideeffects in women’s health we are currently focused on improving breast health by treating fibrocystic breast condition a medical problem that affects half the world’s women the condition which often produces breast tenderness and tissue density can be treated with molecular iodine which is effective but rarely found in a stable form our solution is violet® iodine a daily supplement that produces molecular iodine within the body – exactly where it can be most effective both of these solutions demonstrate the power of biopharmx’s unique combination of innovation and determination caution bpx is a new druglimited by federal or united states law to

biopharmx aims to be a leader in its understanding of the science of the skin healthy skin is the first thing the world notices about an individual young or old as a result biopharmx focuses on the importance of healthy skin at all ages bpx currently in phase  of clinical development bpx may offer a breakthrough in acne treatment because it can deliver the antibiotic to the area of the skin where acne develops the novel hydrophilic non oilbased formulation of minocycline may be more effective than other topical alternatives because they either use less effective antibiotics to penetrate the top layer of the skin or rely on higher concentrations of minocycline which could lead to unpleasant side effects bpx is the first and only stable hydrophilic topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline minocycline an antibacterial and antiinflammatory medicine is the most commonly prescribed acne treatment because it has a lower resistance rate than other antibiotics no stable form of hydrophilic topical minocycline is currently commercially available preliminary animal studies indicate that minocycline delivered by the bpx formulation is efficiently absorbed into the skin reaching the epidermis and the pilosebaceous region where acne develops the results suggest that lower doses of the antibiotic may be used to provide a treatment that is superior to higherdose topical formulations and oral therapies topical targeted formulations are preferable to oral dosing that can have side effects such as diarrhea nausea and dizziness that can discourage compliance lipophilic oilbased topical antibiotic products are occlusive and can compromise drug delivery to compensate for the inefficiency some products use less effective antibiotics while others rely on significantly higher concentrations of antibiotics the biopharmx research found that the hydrophilic bpx formulation distributes evenly is not sticky and does not occlude or irritate the skin an advantage in the

on the dermatology market the company is focused on development of proprietary drug delivery platform technologies to allow for development and commercialization of novel products for the therapeutic aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology market segments the company’s focus is to develop products that treat health or agerelated conditions that are not being adequately addressed or those where current therapies and approaches are suboptimal our strategy is to bring new products to market by identifying optimal delivery mechanisms andor alternative applications for fdaapproved or well characterized active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and biological materials we aim to reduce the time cost and risk profile typically associated with new product development by utilizing active ingredients with demonstrated safety profiles and taking advantage of the expedited regulatory pathways such as section b or k of the federal food drug and cosmetic act this approach may also reduce drug development risk as well as the time and resources required to support regulatory approval for commercialization we deploy a marketdriven approach to identify the limitations of current treatment options and work to develop products that may address these limitations in areas of efficacy safety andor patient experience drug delivery systems at biopharmx our core focus is to create unique drug delivery systems

disciplined approach to research and product development our scientists researchers marketers and other team members are mission driven committed to producing novel treatments to cure intractable medical conditions we focus exclusively on dermatological issues and women’s health we seek to develop therapeutic products that provide unique solutions to common medical problems in these areas our approach is to create novel mechanisms to deliver effective treatments for persistent and often debilitating conditions in dermatology for example we are developing a unique way to deliver acnefighting medicine topically today’s most effective acne medications must be ingested risking undesirable sideeffects topical treatments tend to be ineffective because their formulations do not deliver medication to the layer of skin where acne forms our developmental topical called bpx effectively delivers small amounts of antibiotic to the acne source maximizing treatment effectiveness and reducing sideeffects in women’s health we are currently focused on improving breast health by treating fibrocystic breast condition a medical problem that affects half the world’s women the condition which often produces breast tenderness and tissue density can be treated with molecular iodine which is effective but rarely found in a stable form our solution is violet® iodine a daily supplement that produces molecular iodine within the body – exactly where it can be most effective both of these solutions demonstrate the power of biopharmx’s unique combination of innovation and determination

an individual young or old as a result biopharmx focuses on the importance of healthy skin at all ages bpx currently in phase  of clinical development bpx may offer a breakthrough in acne treatment because it can deliver the antibiotic to the area of the skin where acne develops the novel hydrophilic non oilbased formulation of minocycline may be more effective than other topical alternatives because they either use less effective antibiotics to penetrate the top layer of the skin or rely on higher concentrations of minocycline which could lead to unpleasant side effects bpx is the first and only stable hydrophilic topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline minocycline an antibacterial and antiinflammatory medicine is the most commonly prescribed acne treatment because it has a lower resistance rate than other antibiotics no stable form of hydrophilic topical minocycline is currently commercially available preliminary animal studies indicate that minocycline delivered by the bpx formulation is efficiently absorbed into the skin reaching the epidermis and the pilosebaceous region where acne develops the results suggest that lower doses of the antibiotic may be used to provide a treatment that is superior to higherdose topical formulations and oral therapies topical targeted formulations are preferable to oral dosing that can have side effects such as diarrhea nausea and dizziness that can discourage compliance lipophilic oilbased topical antibiotic products are occlusive and can compromise drug delivery to compensate for the inefficiency some products use less effective antibiotics while others rely on significantly higher concentrations of antibiotics the biopharmx research found that the hydrophilic bpx formulation distributes evenly is not sticky and does not occlude or irritate the skin an advantage in the treatment of acne caution bpx is a new druglimited by federal or united states law to investigational use sign up for our mailing list to

biodelivery that makes a difference  biopharmx corporation was created to fulfill the unmet medical needs of people worldwide to achieve that we take a disciplined approach to research and product development our scientists researchers marketers and other team members are mission driven committed to producing novel treatments to cure intractable medical conditions we focus exclusively on dermatological issues and women’s health we seek to develop therapeutic products that provide unique solutions to common medical problems in these areas our approach is to create novel mechanisms to deliver effective treatments for persistent and often debilitating conditions in dermatology for example we are developing a unique way to deliver acnefighting medicine topically today’s most effective acne medications must be ingested risking undesirable sideeffects topical treatments tend to be ineffective because their formulations do not deliver medication to the layer of skin where acne forms our developmental topical called bpx effectively delivers small amounts of antibiotic to the acne source maximizing treatment effectiveness and reducing sideeffects in women’s health we are currently focused on improving breast health by treating fibrocystic breast condition a medical problem that affects half the world’s women the condition which often produces breast tenderness and tissue density can be treated with molecular iodine which is effective but rarely found in a stable form our solution is violet® iodine a daily supplement that produces molecular iodine within the body – exactly where it can be most effective both of these solutions demonstrate the power of biopharmx’s unique combination of innovation and determination we develop unique health and wellness products for licensing and commercialization in pharmaceutical and overthecounter use      products by design biopharmxs innovative drug delivery products with their unique patented platform technologies are formulated to address the needs of welldefined fastgrowing multibillion dollar markets including dermatology aesthetics otolaryngology ears nose  throat and women’s health   violet iodine a revolution in women’s breast health it’s a daily regimen that alleviates the symptoms you experience with your monthly cycle – like breast tenderness aches heaviness and swelling violet iodine doesn’t just mask the discomfort temporarily it actually promotes better breast health when you take a simple pill every day the result is true relief and reassurance that you’re proactively taking care of your breasts httpwwwvioletdailycom bpx biopharmx aims to be a leader in its understanding of the science of the skin currently in phase  of clinical development bpx may offer a breakthrough in acne treatment because it can deliver the antibiotic to the area of the skin where acne develops the novel hydrophilic non oilbased formulation of minocycline may be more effective than other topical alternatives because they either use less effective antibiotics to penetrate the top layer of the skin or rely on higher concentrations of minocycline which could lead to unpleasant side effects bpx is the first and only stable hydrophilic topical gel with fully solubilized minocycline minocycline an antibacterial and antiinflammatory medicine is the most commonly prescribed acne treatment because it has a lower resistance rate than other antibiotics no stable form of hydrophilic topical minocycline is currently commercially available httpwwwbiopharmxcomproductsdermatology

new way to fight cancer a new way to fight cancer share tweet link email print it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer but what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients including kidney and lung cancer in fact research from the american association for cancer research shows that for advancedmelanoma patients survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options it used to be science fiction harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer tweet biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types with  medicines and vaccines in development for cancer  percent of which have the potential to be

a serious condition that effects more than  million americans while complications of the disease can be dire there is hope biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments diabetes the patient perspective diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose sugar in the blood normally the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy with diabetes the body either does not make enough insulin type  diabetes or does not use it properly type  diabetes leading to high blood glucose levels uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack lowerlimb amputation vision impairment and blindness endocrinologist dr william bill chin has experience treating endocrine disorders including diabetes as chief medical officer at phrma he works to ensure that patient voices are heard drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes when dr chins son danny was  he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst dr chin diagnosed his son himself with type  diabetes he says i don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease particularly one that will be chronic in many ways it’s forever but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed the changing landscape of diabetes treatment the medications that danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years a decade ago a number of insulin options were available to patients as well as oral and injected medications successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels to control their glucose patients needed multiple daily injections andor multiple oral medicines in recent years researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients from fewer pills to less frequent injections careful monitoring and treatment are still needed but current medicines in development offer a promising future there are  medicines currently in development for type  and type  diabetes and diabetesrelated conditions a new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetesrelated complications that affect the kidneys blood vessels and eyes all of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the fda while these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type  diabetes ongoing research remains critical in fact diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the united states in  dr chin says collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes  we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease this can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry for more information download the phrma

progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan to build a sustainable sciencebased health care
