physicians concluded that we should reposition our business to endeavor to provide the community with higher quality more costeffective health care the next generation of advanced managed care plans requires providers to be capable of bearing and managing greater levels of healthcare risk providers successful in this arena must support aligned incentives that support costeffectiveness and improved quality a strong primary care physician base a vertically and horizontally integrated continuum of care agreement upon and reasonable adherence to clinical protocols and an information system that supports contract management member services clinical judgment and management interclinician communications and sales activities recognizing the need to build a new health care delivery program the physician hospital organization development oversight committee of st peters university hospital recommended the development of such an organization partners in care corp was the result of that recommendation partners in care corp is based on a demanding set of physician eligibility criteria and greater expectations from hospital services to ensure market leadership in clinical quality customer service and efficiency the success of this endeavor is based upon the following assumption greater cost efficiencies can be achieved with equivalent or measurably better clinical outcomes and member satisfaction through aligned incentives and clinician managed care partners in care corp was created to be a forprofit multiple shareholder new jersey corporation jointly owned and governed by st peters university hospital and physician members of the united medical group pc the company is structured to ensure equal physician representation on the board and up to  percent ownership by physicians physicians are full partners in planning implementing and continuously improving corporate performance to provide the various products participating physicians are organized under the auspices of a new jersey professional corporation the united medical group pc a group practice without walls and other similar physician organizational structures via the large network partnership concept the concept of large network partnerships permits currently organized physician groups and networks ie ipas to participate in risk contracts through partners in care corp while keeping risk pools segmented from the united medical group the existence of this flexible approach allows for the management of risk based contracts while preserving physician autonomy and sustaining small groups and solo practice models a system like ours needs as many qualified primary care physicians as possible in order to achieve a credible marketplace presence additionally to round out the provider network partners in care has various strategic relationships via its risk partners and its third party administrator to access a broad network of providers nationwide currently pcp recruitment is in full effect through both recruiting individual physicians as members of the united medical group pc and negotiation through ongoing negotiations with large network partnerships that will remain semiautonomous industry background in the mids health care providers in the greater new brunswick new jersey area from tertiary centers to primary care physicians began to face significant choices among them were whether to be an active organizer of a managed care delivery system to be a member of an integrated managed care network to be an independent vendor of services to a managed care plan or hmo to pursue the declining indemnity market or some combination of the above during this transition prices and revenues especially for tertiary hospitals and highly specialized physicians have declined fees for procedures have dropped by twentyfive to seventyfive percent locally as the region coped with the full implementation of the rbrvs system for federal programs and the adoption of rbrvs fee schedule by most commercial hmos and ppos coupled with the growth of managed care and the consolidation of the hmo marketplace especially the growth of aetnaus healthcare the second half of the decade was very difficult the magnitude of this shift demands dramatic restructuring of care delivery to eliminate unnecessary treatment improve efficiency and increase market share concurrently government accrediting bodies employers purchasing groups health plans and a more informed public demand data documenting that lower prices and utilization levels are not compromising outcomes the only effective mechanism for provider groups to cope with this type of change is to efficiently organize to both successfully bear and manage healthcare risk pics business model achieves this through successfully managing the delivery of care under systemwide pmpm funding this is contrasted with other physicianhospital organization type structures whose focus remained one of attempting to make up for lost unit prices in a fee for service marketplace by increasing the units of service there are too many pressures being brought to bear against the increased units strategy for it to be effective over the long term this harsh lesson has been learned by many of pics former competitors within the past  months hip health plan of new jersey and american preferred provider plan both collapsed sending shock waves through the new jersey health services marketplace and our local community the new jersey state department of banking and insurance has announced plans to amend its regulations to require all new jersey hmos to operate under stricter financial control and oversight by regulators while lines of business other than hmo businesses such as ppo insurance plans and phos ie idss and msos are prevalent both in the state and nationwide in new jersey only hmos are obligated to provide the state with detailed reports therefore little information is available regarding the other markets hence the focus on the health care industry has been limited to the hmo component of the business hmo enrollment increased  between  and  at yearend  the total hmo membership for the state of new jersey was  by  enrollment had increased by approximately  to  during  hmo enrollment dropped  but rebounded in  growing  in the new jersey hmo market there has been a tendency for a small number of hmos to continuously strengthen while several others weaken fall out of the market or become merged into larger plans aetnaus healthcare possessing  of the  market share continues to dominate the marketplace other market participants include horizon blue a blue crossblue shield subsidiary and physicians health services formerly first option health plan and oxford possessing market shares of   and  respectively the three hmos with the largest market share all offer medicare and medicaid plans in new jersey oxford offers commercial and medicare only other smaller hmos also offer these plans in new jersey a comparison of new jersey hmo financial statistics from year end  to  shows a  increase in total health care related revenue to  medical and hospital expenses across the new jersey hmo market decreased  in  totaling  and yielding a medical loss ratio of  the medical loss ratio increased to  through the first three quarters of  mso development as previously discussed we were developed as a response to the desire to provide the community with higher quality more costeffective health care with the support of spuh and community physicians we believe that a health care delivery system managed by an mso management service organization will provide the service needed for the next generation of hmos and advanced managed care plans to provide the various products participating physicians are organized under the auspices of a new jersey professional corporation united medical group pc a group practice without walls the existence of this large multispecialty group practice allows for the management of risk based contracts while preserving small group and solo practice models a system like ours requires as many qualified primary care physicians as possible in order to achieve a credible marketplace presence contrarily the need for specialists is based on a network need methodology that evaluates geographic accessibility criteria delivery system efficiency the number of enrollees and primary care physicians and other criteria the number of physicians participating is a function of the credentialing criteria set by the board of directors of umgpic and the network management committee currently pcp recruitment is in full effect through i recruiting individual physicians as members of the united medical group pc and ii negotiating large network partnerships that will remain semiautonomous the concept of large network partnerships permits currently organized physician groups and networks ie ipas to participate in risk contracts through our organization while keeping risk pools segmented from the united medical group this allows us to acquire the greatest number of enrollees and allows for variable levels of medical management dependent upon the risk we undertake business strategy our overall strategic goal is to expand and strengthen our current position in new jerseys health care delivery market to achieve this goal we must aggressively develop all key infrastructure components and management expertise under a healthcare risk managementall products risk contracting strategy over a  month period successfully negotiate and efficiently manage population based at risk contracts continue to improve our core management competencies and managerial expertise continue to foster existing strategic partnerships recruit and retain primary care physicians throughout the regional market maintain and improve the clinical and operational information feedback cycle time which has been reduced in the last year from months to hours successfully compete with best in region healthcare risk management service vendors at risk contracts with compensation based on age and sex adjusted capitation rates andor percentage of premium is currently our dominant business line we currently have in place such contracts with aetnaushc and horizon we are also designed to provide highcaliber professional services such as management of risk business development medical management including utilization management and quality assurance information systems credentialing provider support services network development and management other services historically available for physician practices include practice management services we offer expansion of the customer base for these services will be pursued major business lines our major business lines are the health plan management services and the physician support services  health plan management services our main business is capturing covered lives and then assisting the providers in managing the delivery of healthcare of those lives the main components to this business line include a negotiationmanagement of at risk contracts b negotiationmanagement of large network partnerships c pcp recruitment d managed care contractingadministration e network management and provider relations f claims and stop loss management g medical management h member services currently we most aggressively pursue at risk contracts with compensation based on age and sex adjusted capitation rates andor percentage of premium we provide highcaliber professional services such as management of risk business development information systems credentialing provider support services network development and management and medical management including utilization management and quality assurance we believe that risk contract negotiation and management currently has the ability to generate the greatest revenue the success of this area relies on the ability to negotiate contracts capture covered lives and assist the providers in managing those lives risk contracting involves contracting with the major health plans contracting with primary care physicians and persuading health plan enrollees to elect our primary care physicians in  we entered into our first full risk contract with aetnaus healthcare and pursuant to that agreement we are responsible for delivering and medically managing the complete medical loss ratio with the exception of pharmacy mental health and services inconsistent with the ethical and religious directives for catholic healthcare facilities in august  the medicare risk component was implemented with aushc the aushc risk contract presently covers commercial and medicare lives with an option to integrate medicaid lives into the risk program at yearend  there were  atrisk lives including  medicare members during  pic and horizon completed an arrangement whereby we will share in reduction in medical costs from an established budget effective july st this is the first step in building a longterm full risk sharing relationship that has been anticipated for some time we will once again be the manager of the risk related clinical and financial information while our hmo partner retains the responsibility for utilization management and claims processing however our role will evolve to become increasingly involved in all aspects of medical management the agreement encompasses commercial hmopos medicare hmo and should lead into risk sharing for horizons selfinsured population the commercial population should grow from  to  by the first quarter of  while medicare should remain around the  member level the key management areas for risk contracting are also essential in the delivery of the health plan divisions second source of business administering the erisa employee health benefits plan for spuh dba partners in care health plan direct contracting with spuh regarding this plan is through a selfinsured erisa health plan which we manage this structure is necessary because we are not currently licensed as either a health care insurance company or an hmo within the state of new jersey physician support services the current delivery system division has been evaluated and restructured to focus on physician support services as part of our restructuring we eliminated all unprofitable or noncomplimentary lines of business the delivery system division will thus be transitioned into the physicians support services area the main components and subbusiness lines include the following a provider connectivity and ehealth  electronic billing solution for hcfa s  ease the interface with managed care organizations  reduce the paperwork burden on physician office staffs  improve the clinical information flow among pic providers b referral management c information systems and services d business office e site operations management f general administrative and management services g operational assessments evaluations and general counseling h advocacy dispute resolution issues management health plan communications etc we cultivate four  core competencies  business development and contracting our success relies on our ability to negotiate contracts and capture covered lives each covered life converts to about a  annual revenue stream for health plan risk contracting we must perform two functions to acquire enrollees first we must contract with the major health plans second we must contract with primary care physicians who hold contracts with the health plan the first is a contracting and personal sales function of our executive officers the second is a large coordinated effort between pic and the health plans for the erisa line of business we may contract directly with the selfinsured employee benefit plan or we may partner with our health plan risk partners hmos to convert existing membership to atrisk status the first is a direct administrative services only aso health plan sales function in partnership via contracted third party administrators the second is a direct aso health plan sales function via our health plan risk partners both areas are fundamental core competencies of ours that will be developed by harnessing the untapped expertise within our organization and expanding our business acquisition strategy the success of our marketing will require an educational component to increase awareness of the advantages of a healthcare risk management company such as partners in care and specifically of risk contracting more aggressive marketing and services must be developed additional market research must be undertaken at regular intervals to obtain the constant feedback of our customers primary care physicians hospitals specialists health plans and enrollees and partners needs and perceptions currently one of the greatest challenges facing us in this area is the saturation of the existing pcp base due to the influx of the hip population into aushc  network management and physician support servicesps  we must be able to provide services to providers which are perceived as value added revenue improvement expense reduction quality of care enhancement in order to balance our financial needs with market attractiveness to physicians in conjunction with our strategic partners we are currently developing an array of these services which will be supported through a fortified network management department  information management reporting and transfer the ability to gather store analyze report and disseminate information eg physician connectivity in a timely manner regardless of the geographical distribution of providers is central to the success of a healthcare risk management company through our initiatives and managements expertise in converting raw data into management information we are uniquely qualified to succeed hippa health insurance portability and accountability act regulations will continue to make this area ever more challenging but through an array of strategic partnerships and creative ehealth strategies we are positioning ourselves to maintain our unique position in the region with respect to information management hippa is a federal mandate requiring the health industry to implement a series of data and transaction standards in an effort to increase the protection and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information  medical management the medical management plan involves the following existing lines of medical business  health plan risk partners  third party administrator business partners the original template for medical management is based on the relationship with health plans medical management in this relationship is done in conjunction with health plan and data is shared with us the health plan and our medical directors interact with attending physicians to ensure timeliness of service quality issues and effective medical management our medical directors will discuss medical cases and offer alternatives to care to the attending physicians programs designed and offered by the health plan and the health plans case management and discharge planning departments augment this process medical management with third party administrator business partners is an expanded role our team obtains utilization and discharge planning information directly our medical director and medical management team then interact with the attending physicians as above regarding case management discharge planning quality assessment and utilization of inpatient and outpatient services programmatically medical management is entering a substantial but focused expansion phase current projects underway include initiatives aimed at enhancing the delivery of services immediately following the acute care hospital phase of care these services whether sub acute care rehabilitation skilled nursing or home care are frequently found to be extremely fragmented and not well coordinated with the acute care facility in many cases it is the family not the clinical community who must serve as the care manager coordinating and reaching out to the various levels of care we are committed to defragmenting this service delivery and in the process substantial and measurable cost reductions are anticipated a second area of focus will be the delivery of care in the continuum from emergency services to acute hospitalization our research indicates substantial improvement potential from both a quality care and cost perspective in addressing and extending the services available in the emergency department of participating facilities ranging from observation to short term treatment it is felt that there are ample opportunities for the improvement of the care delivery process in this venue credentialing services to date we have recruited   umg specialists and  umg pcps we have also credentialed  pcps in large network partnership  family practice center ferren mall and  pcps in large network partnership cjpn primary care and specialist physicians in our core network these physicians are located at over  locations throughout middlesex somerset hunterdon monmouth and mercer counties making the united medical group pc one of the largest groups in the state of new jersey the initial physician participation was based on the following criteria  board certification or board eligibility to be certified within  years  cost per discharge  length of stay  quality and utilization outcome indicators  malpractice history all criteria met or exceeded national committee on quality assurance ncqa standards in order to make us meet the market standard and be a more desirable candidate for delegated credentialing in risk contracting the network development focus for  is on large network partnership development in addition to primary care physician recruitment large network partnerships are large physician groups that participate in our contracts initially twentytwo pcps have been targeted for recruitment into our organization via these two strategies ultimately an additional  pcps in central new jersey are necessary to meet strategic targets information management and performance reporting although information management and performance reporting capabilities have been a function of our operations since inception our current reorganization will include a substantial expansion of resources in this area by increasing the number and capabilities of existing staff focusing on products by simplifying our operating system environment and expanding corporate use and functionality of the internet for research data storage dissemination and ecommerce marketing we have not traditionally had a formal marketing and sales strategy as a result we have dedicated only minimum levels of management focus and resources to marketing and sales our health plan management services division has approached the overall health care market as a wholesaler through its risk agreement with aushc more direct efforts have been employed for the partners in care health plan which services the selfinsured employee population of spuh in early second quarter  a concentrated sales initiative was launched which utilized a newly developed provider relations staff and senior management resources developing and implementing a formal marketing strategy plan is a high priority for us as we fortify and broaden our product portfolio for direct retail distribution to specific market groups we are currently focusing on identifying specific target markets and market segments designing marketing plans to achieve acceptable penetration levels within each market and developing a communications and promotional strategy to establish brand awareness image across all market segments we intend to facilitate the transition from a wholesale to a retail productservice distribution approach and maximize
