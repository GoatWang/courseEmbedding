wagner biography  international mesothelioma interest group j christopher wagner biography j christopher wagner marieclaude jaurand on j christopher wagner for those involved in research on health effects of asbestos fibres chris was one of the most outstanding authorities on asbestosrelated diseases both from a pathological point of view and regarding his expertise on the experimental approach to asbestos toxicology chris wagner was born in pretoria south africa on april th  his father was an eminent geologist the director of the south african geological survey the family had emigrated from london in  chris was  years old when his father died chris was educated in johannesburg and natal and went to the university of natal in  during world war ii chris served in the south african army taking part in the north african and italian campaigns after the war he returned to johannesburg witwatersburg school of medicine graduating in  thereafter he trained in pathology at the south african institute for medical research and in  was appointed asbestos research fellow at the pneumoconiosis research unit in johannesburgh during this time chris published a famous paper on “diffuse pleural mesothelioma and asbestos exposure in the northwestern cape province” in the br j indust med wagner jc sleggs ca marchand p    in this paper chris established for the first time a relationship between pleural mesothelioma and asbestos exposure it was also in this paper that mesothelioma was finally accepted as a separate pathological entity in  dr j gilson director of the mrc pneumoconiosis research unit at llandough hospital in wales persuaded chris to join his team he worked there until retirement in  here he was the first to establish a colony of rats with lungs free from organisms causing lung disease for use in following disease patterns after exposure to dusts he established both intrapleural and inhalation methods for the study of lung fibrosis lung cancer and pleural mesotheliomas he and his team found that asbestos dimensions were an important parameter in the induction of pathogenesis he was engaged in collaborative research in many parts of the united kingdom and in other parts of the world such as cyprus turkey greece and canada and gave freely of his help and advice for young researchers the observations made by chris wagner gave an enthusiastic boost to investigations into the mechanisms of the pathogenicity of asbestos chris wagner married margaret a hematologist in south africa they had one son and two daughters and two granddaughters chris and margaret retired to dorset in  where chris continued to be consulted until shortly before his death on  may  his work was sound and he provided milestones in research work on asbestos toxicity his results were of paramount importance in the regulation of asbestos use providing a better consideration of occupational asbestosrelated diseases in addition to his work on asbestos chris and his coworkers studied another type of fiber called erionite in collaboration with professor i baris a turkish clinician who had discovered a high mortality rate due to mesotheliomas in some areas in turkey the findings of fibrogenicity and carcinogenicity of erionite in rats provided an important demonstration of the ability of other sorts of fibres to produce lung and pleural damage in  chris wagner received the prestigious charles s mott prize from the general motors cancer research foundation for the most outstanding recent contribution related to the causes and ultimate prevention of cancer chris was a quiet philosophical person appreciated by his research coworkers for those who encountered him during scientific meetings he was a nice warm friendly person with a good touch of humour the telegraph published this obituary following dr wagner’s death in  j christopher wagner the pathologist who has died aged  demonstrated that particular kinds of asbestos caused specific cancers sometimes  years after exposure to the asbestos fibres wagner became internationally known for his work on occupational lung diseases but it was in  that he made his name with a paper “diffuse pleural mesothelioma and asbestos exposure in the north western cape province” it would be difficult to overemphasise the importance of this study which was to become the most quoted paper in occupational medicine it initiated an explosion of research into asbestosrelated diseases wagner’s paper showed that in some cases of cancer in the pleura the membrane separating the lung from the chest wall exposure to asbestos had been for only a few months the lag between initial exposure and the development of the tumour could be very long – usually two to four decades this was the first time that a specific type of asbestos had been implicated in a particular cancer for wagner had found that this very rare form of tumour occurred only in individuals living in the kuruman district of cape province in south africa this was where blue asbestos was mined wagner’s work on asbestosrelated lung diseases began in  when he was appointed a research fellow at the south african pneumoconiosis research unit in johannesburg south africa is unique in having asbestos deposits of all the main commercial types – chrysotile white crocidolite blue and amosite brown each situated in a different area the pneumoconiosis research unit studied disease in asbestos miners from the different locations in  wagner presented a paper at the international pneumoconiosis conference held in johannesburg read the paper this included his observations on mesotheliomas occurring in association with asbestos exposure it brought him to the notice of dr john gilson the head of the medical research council’s pneumoconiosis unit at llandough hospital in wales gilson persuaded him to join the pneumoconiosis unit in  and he worked there until his retirement in  in  at a new york academy of sciences conference wagner made another influential contribution to knowledge of the effects of asbestos he presented studies which showed that the kind of cancer called mesothelioma could be induced experimentally in rats by the implantation of asbestos this set in train experiments in different parts of the world to study the mechanism of how asbestos caused cancer the experiments carried out by christopher wagner and his team showed the importance of characterising the dusts used in the studies they showed that the shape of asbestos fibres was of great importance long thin fibres were much more dangerous wagner collaborated with dr muriel newhouse who has also recently died in studying asbestos diseases occurring in workers and their relatives from an east london asbestos factory where exposures and amounts of disease were high a disturbing observation was that mesotheliomas could develop not only in the workers but also in household contacts of asbestos workers as a result of laundering their contaminated clothes wagner was always mindful that asbestos not only posed health hazards to those who were exposed to it but had also brought great benefits he did not like the way the american press had sensationalised some of the reports about the dangers of asbestos to the general population he felt it more important to improve the working environment of the industry to ensure its safe use he put this into perspective in an article in  “on may   the two largest commercial deposits of blue asbestos met in the north sea off jutland it is obvious if one follows the details of this battle and particularly the role played by the fifth british battle squadron that in one day blue asbestos saved more lives than it has claimed since” john christopher wagner was born in pretoria on april   the family originally german had emigrated from london to south africa in  christopher’s father percy albert who died when the boy was six years old was one of south africa’s most eminent economic geologists he had described many mineral deposits in africa including asbestos diamonds gold and platinum during the second world war christopher wagner served with the south african field artillery and took part in the north african and italian campaigns in  he graduated in medicine from the witwatersrand school of medicine he showed a penchant early in his career for original observation being involved in the identification of a new type of organism similar to a tubercle bacillus this organism was to be found in inflammatory lesions affecting the cape hyrax locally known as the “dassie” a small hoofed mammal about the size of a rabbit during his career at the pneumoconiosis unit at llandough wagner had the opportunity to conduct experimental and human studies he put together a formidable team for conducting experimental studies he forged strong links with a number of investigators to look into the patterns of disease connected with the use of asbestos in different locations around the world wagner’s sense of humour found expression in such papers as his confessions of a reluctant measurer which debunks the holy grail of measurement in it wagner points out that many important medical advances have been made by empiricists such as harvey jenner snow lister and florey and that measurement should be subservient to original observation in  he was awarded the prestigious charles s mott prize of the general motors cancer research foundation awarded for outstanding research contributions to the causes and ultimate prevention of cancer wagner was something of a bon viveur and aided by his son charles he developed a good wine cellar much appreciated by friends and colleagues other interests were archaeology rugby and gardening he is survived by his wife margaret a doctor whom he married in  for  years she worked with him at the mrc unit they had a son and two daughters kathryn mcconnochie wrote this obituary for dr wagner for the guardian chris wagner who has died aged  was an outstanding international authority on asbestosrelated cancer in  while working at the south african pneumoconiosis research unit he conducted an autopsy on a black african miner thought to have died from tuberculosis he later wrote “on opening the thoracic cavity i was amazed to find a huge gelatinous tumour” the tumour was a mesothelioma and further examination of the lung revealed clumps of asbestos bodies it was a finding that influenced the rest of his life wagner was born in pretoria the elder child of percy wagner one of south africas’s most distinguished economic geologists chris was six years old when his father died and perhaps not surprisingly spent his early years in his shadow he was educated at michaelhouse natal and in  went up to the university of natal in  he joined the south african army fighting in north africa and italy his memory of that time was indelible – in particular of the events surrounding the battle for monte cassino back home again he returned to witwatersrand medical school from where he graduated in  after chris diagnosed his first mesothelioma he conferred with colleagues and discovered that a group of similar cases had occurred at a tuberculosis hospital in kimberley he hypothesised that asbestos could be involved and soon made a link with exposure to blue asbestos crocidolite this required some detective work as many of the patients had never worked with asbestos but lived near the asbestos fields others had left the areas while they were still children in  chris presented his findings to the pneumoconiosis conference in johannesburg where the audience included john gilson then director of the medical research council’s pneumoconiosis research unit pru in penarth south wales chris took gilson to visit the mines and deposits in south africa and gilson recognised chris’s exceptional knowledge of the asbestos then being imported into britain the publication in  of his seminal paper diffuse pleural mesothelioma and asbestos exposure in northwestern cape province written with ca sleggs and p marchand became the most cited work in the field of industrial medicine and put chris firmly on the asbestos research map it also led to his doctorate from the university of witwatersrand in  that same year at the invitation of gilson chris moved to the pru and together they set about stirring up interest in the asbestos problem an activity that culminated in a groundbreaking conference on the biological effects of asbestos convened by the new york academy of sciences in  contrary to expectations the british asbestos industry cooperated fully chris was the first person to emphasise the association between blue asbestos and mesothelioma and to set up a programme of research to investigate asbestosrelated cancer there were a few earlier case reports suggesting a possible link but no one had attempted further investigations or considered the type of asbestos involved indeed chris had to work hard to persuade his colleagues that his research would be worthwhile he succeeded and went on to prove that different fibre types in different doses have different effects on lung tissue this research was pivotal in the introduction of safety standards and the banning of blue asbestos in britain chris liked nothing better than to collaborate with colleagues his research workers were very proud of him and he in turn was fiercely loyal to them at the pru he contributed to projects in other fields and made original observations on the pathology of coalworkers’ pneumoconiosis he was a dominant if unconventional figure at research meetings where he delighted in discussing his research with the international academic community despite dyslexia chris had  original research articles published along with many book chapters and reviews – though notwithstanding his success he had dark moments of despair fortunately he was widely read and had both a prodigious memory and a talent for making lifelong friends qualities which helped him to retain his equilibrium he received numerous accolades including in  the charles s mott prize of the general motors cancer research foundation for “the most outstanding recent contribution related to the causes and ultimate prevention of cancer” in  chris and his wife margaret retired to dorset where he indulged his love of old stones becoming a respected member of the dorset archaeological society he had a logical mind a brilliant sense of humour and a zest for life more than that he left the world a safer place for the rest of us he is survived by margaret a son two daughters and two granddaughters john christopher wagner research pathologist born april   died may   wagner award recipients  international mesothelioma interest group wagner award recipients j christopher wagner dr wagners biography j christopher wagner was a leader in the field of mesothelioma who made major contributions to the understanding of mesothelioma its cause and the goals for prevention by his clinical observations and animal studies he was the first to establish that mesothelioma was caused by asbestos inspired by this example the international mesothelioma interest group presents the wagner medal every two years to an individual who has made major original contributions to the understanding of mesothelioma either in basic or applied research it is the highest honor presented by the international mesothelioma interest group to a leader in the field v courtney broaddus md  dr broaddus has focused on the study of the chemoresistance of mesothelioma by studying the role of apoptosis and most recently autophagy for these studies she has pioneered the use of d models called spheroids generated either from cell lines or from actual human mesothelioma tumor cultured ex vivo and demonstrated their clinical relevance her prior research explored the role of the mesothelial cell in pleural disease and their interaction of mesothelial cells with asbestos fibers she has been active in imig and served as president from  to  at which time she created the website and imig logo other awards have included the pioneer award from marf she currently is the john f murray distinguished professor at the university of california san francisco and chief of the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine she has served as the editorinchief for the th edition of the murray  nadel’s textbook of respiratory medicine  raffit hassan md  dr hassan has played a pivotal role in validating the tumor differentiation antigen mesothelin as a target for cancer therapy and development of mesothelintargeted immunotherapy this work has laid the foundation for several mesothelindirected agents that he is evaluating in the clinic for treatment of mesothelioma and also of lung and pancreatic cancer his clinical trials using an antimesothelin immunotoxin has have shown major tumor responses in patients with mesothelioma dr hassan currently serves as both chief of the solid tumor immunology section and cochief of the thoracic and gastrointestinal oncology branch at the national cancer institute nci he is internationally recognized in the mesothelioma field for his outstanding contributions to translational research and clinical management he has received several important honors including a clinical scientist development award from the american society of clinical oncology asco and the pioneer award from marf  joseph r testa phd  for the past two decades dr testa has dedicated much of his research to the understanding the consistent genomic alterations found in mesothelioma among the  seminal reports by his group dr testa identified a high frequency of inactivating mutations in the neurofibromatosis type  gene nf in primary mms and derived cell lines bianchi et al pnas  most recently dr testa played a critical role in the identification of bap as the gene that was mutated in the germline of families and that caused the high incidence of mesothelioma observed in family members testa jr et al nat genet  dr testa’s contributions to mesothelioma research have had a major impact on our understanding of the biology of this dreaded disease  steven m albelda md  an extremely creative and productive basic and clinical researcher a mentor and a teacher dr albelda has made innumerable and substantial contributions to the field of mesothelioma after a successful early career in the study of endothelial cell biology and adhesion receptors he established a benchtobedside research career concentrating on mesothelioma as well as lung cancer he developed a multidisciplinary group the  thoracic oncology research laboratory torl which has been extremely productive over almost  decades the torl pioneered the use of immunogene therapy in mesothelioma and other cancers and has conducted the first trials of gene therapy in patients with mesothelioma in this and other novel ways dr albelda has made and continues to make outstanding contributions to this field  brooke mossman phd  dr mossman is an accomplished scientist mentor and leader in the fields of asbestosinduced carcinogenesis and mesothelioma and her mechanistic research on responses of mesothelial and lung epithelial cells to different asbestos types has advanced the amphibole hypothesis originally suggested by dr wagner in his epidemiologic and animal studies more currently dr mossman has focused on targeted preventive approaches to mesothelioma and asbestosis using inhibitors of cell signaling and survival pathways that she has elucidated in her research on asbestos  harvey pass md  as an active surgeon and advocate researcher and teacher dr pass has contributed in almost all arenas to progress in mesothelioma his contributions at the bench have been related to sv expression arrays and early detection in clinical research he helped design
