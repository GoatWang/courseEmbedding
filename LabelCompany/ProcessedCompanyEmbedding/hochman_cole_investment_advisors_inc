individuals in the legislation  extension of the bushera tax cuts for those with taxable income below  joint or  single taxable income above these levels will be subject to an income tax rate of  up

deductions can’t be reduced by more than   personal exemptions will also be reduced for those with agi in excess of  joint and  single the reduction is  for each  of agi in excess of these threshold amounts this means that exemptions are reduced to zero if agi exceeds  joint or  single  the employee portion of the social security withholding tax increases from  to  this increase also applies to those subject to the selfemployment tax  the estate tax exemption remains at  million however the top estate tax rate increases from  to   the amt exemption was increased to  “patch” levels and the change was made permanent in addition the legislation includes permanent extensions to both the adoption and dependent care credits certain deductions were given twoyear extensions including the  deduction for teachers’ classroom expenses the state sales tax deduction in lieu of deducting state income taxes and charitable donations of assets in an ira account the legislation did not affect the

a look at some financial changes  the opportunities they may presentevery year brings some financial change so here are some relevant changes relating to investment tax and estate planning for retirement plans k b and  plan annual contribution limits rise slightly to  and you can contribute an additional  to these accounts if you are  or older this year ira contribution levels are unchanged from  the ceiling is   if you will be  or older in as you strive to contribute as much as you comfortably can to these accounts this year you will probably notice some changes with the retirement plan at your workplace in  retirement plan sponsors ie employers will have to note all of the fees and expenses linked to the funds in the plan to plan participants so if you have a k or b you may notice some differences in the disclosures on your statements and you will probably notice more information coming your way about fees there is also a push in washington dc to have financial companies provide lifetime income illustrations on retirement plan account statements projections of your expected monthly benefit at retirement age income taxes wealthy americans are set to face greater income tax burdens in  so  may be the last year to take advantage of certain factors for example the top tax bracket in  is slated to be at  instead of the current  this year capital gains and dividends will be taxed at  or less for everyone  for those in the  and  tax brackets in  the qualified capital gains tax rate is scheduled to rise to  and qualified dividends will be taxed as ordinary income so taking a little more income in  could be smartin  the wealthiest americans are supposed to be hit with new medicare taxes a new  levy on unearned income such as capital gains income from real estate dividends and interest and a new  tax or earned income so next year the truly wealthy could effectively face in the neighborhood of  federal taxes additionally the irs is planning to limit itemized deductions for upperincome taxpayers in  a phaseout will also apply for the personal exemption deductionestate  gift taxes at the end of  some very nice estate tax breaks could sunset barring action by congress  could see a  leap in the federal estate tax rate from  to  the individual estate tax exclusion currently  million is scheduled to be reduced to  millionas we have unified gift and estate tax rates those numbers and percentages also apply to gift taxes that is from  to  top federal gift tax rate is set to go from  to  and the lifetime gift tax exemption amount is scheduled to fall  per individual to  million the annual gift tax exemption is  per recipient in  there is an exemption limit for qualifying educational and medical payments if you want to gift relatives or friends you may want to avoid procrastinating for another very good reason when you make such a gift early in a year the recipient will gain both the principal and any appreciation tied to the gifted asset in that yearspeaking of gifts we said goodbye to charitable ira gifts in  the ira charitable rollover a boon to nonprofits and a handy tax deduction option for taxpayers older than age ½ was not extended into  not even temporarily as a sweetener to the payroll tax extension bill there is hope it will be back two bills have been introduced in congress with that goal one sponsored by sen olympia snowe rme and sen charles schumer dny and another by rep wally herger rca and rep earl blumenauer dor the proposed legislation would let ira owners start making charitable ira gifts at age ½ and remove the  limit on the rollovers the limits on the generationskipping transfer tax could change too assuming the bushera tax cuts do sunset the gstt rate would jump from  this year to  in  with the gstt exemption falling from  per person this year to roughly  million per person next yearso given all these changes it would be wise to plan early in  as you strive to start the year off on the right foot

how ltc insurance can help protect your assets create a pool of healthcare dollars that will grow in any markethow will you pay for long term care the sad fact is that most people don’t know the answer to that question but a solution is availableas baby boomers leave their careers behind long term care insurance will become very important in their financial strategies the reasons to get an ltc policy after age  are very compelling your premium payments buy you access to a large pool of money which can be used to pay for long term care costs by paying for ltc out of that pool of money you can preserve your retirement savings and income the cost of assisted living or nursing home care alone could motivate you to pay the premiums genworth financial conducts a respected annual cost of care survey to gauge the price of long term care in the us the  report found that• in  the median annual cost of a private room in a nursing home is  or  per day –  more than it was in  • a private onebedroom unit in an assisted living facility has a median cost of  a month – which is  higher than it was in • the median payment to a nonmedicare certified statelicensed home health aide in  is  per hour up  from the most recent  estimate of ltc costs from the us department of health and human services was even higher than the genworth survey   per day for a private room in a nursing home or  per year can you imagine spending an extra k out of your retirement savings in a year what if you had to do it for more than one year let’s take that  figure from the government and factor in inflation at  inflation that private room will cost you  per year by  and  annually by  aarp notes that approximately  of people over age  will require some kind of long term care during their lifetimeswhy procrastinate the earlier you opt for ltc coverage the cheaper the premiums this is why many people purchase it before they retire those in poor health or over the age of  are frequently ineligible for coveragewhat it pays for some people think ltc coverage just pays for nursing home care that’s inaccurate it can pay for a wide variety of nursing social and rehabilitative services at home and away from home for people with a chronic illness or disability or people who just need assistance bathing eating or dressingchoosing a dba that stands for daily benefit amount  the maximum amount that your ltc plan will pay per day for care in a nursing home facility you can choose a daily benefit amount when you pay for your ltc coverage and you can also choose the length of time that you may receive the full dba on a daily basis the dba typically ranges from a few dozen dollars to hundreds of dollars some of these plans offer you “inflation protection” at enrollment meaning that every few years you will have the chance to buy additional coverage and get compounding  so your pool of money can grow the medicare misconception too many people think medicare will pick up the cost of long term care medicare is not long term care insurance medicare will only pay for the first  days of nursing home care and only if  you are getting skilled care and  you go into the nursing home right after a hospital stay of at least  days medicare also covers limited home visits for skilled care and some hospice services for the terminally ill that’s allnow medicaid can actually pay for long term care – if you are destitute but are you willing to wait until you are broke for a way to fund long term carewhy not look into this you may have heard that ltc insurance is expensive compared with some other forms of policies but the annual premiums about as much as you’d spend on a used car from the late s are nothing compared to realworld ltc costs ask your financial or insurance professional about some of the ltc choices you can explore – while many americans have life health and disability insurance that’s not the same thing as long term care coveragehave any questions feel

accountare you going to purchase stocks in  if your answer to that question is “yes’ there’s an important irs rule change you should know about if you buy a stock in  your broker must report the gain or loss when you sell it in fact this will be true for the following investment classes as of the following datesindividual stocks you buy after january  mutual fund shares you buy after january  bonds options  other securities you buy after january    prior to  reporting the gain or loss triggered by the sale of an investment was your responsibility – but the irs wasn’t satisfied with thatit’s all about the cost basis to properly tax your investment when it is sold the irs has to know what you initially paid for it in financial jargon this acquisition price is known as the cost basisit isn’t always easy to figure the cost basis – factors like splits mergers reinvestment of dividends and inherited or gifted investments can make things hazy the irs simply doesn’t want to rely on your math anymore – federal government studies estimate that the agency loses up to  billion in tax revenue each year because of cost basis errors your broker will send form b to the irs each sale of a stock bought in  will generate a b you will get a copy the irs will get a copy on that b form the gain or loss will be characterized as longterm or shorttermthe key here is to make sure your broker uses the accounting method you prefer as they report gains or losses most brokerages report individual securities using the fifo method as that is the irs default method fifo is an acronym for “first in first out” – that is the shares bought first are the shares sold first with the fifo method you end up selling your cheapest shares first in a down market that’s okay – but in a rising market many investors favor the specific id method in which they identify specific shares they want to sell using this method enables you to sell your highestcost shares first which can be taxwise more details worth noting according to the wall street journal the new reporting rules will also apply to reits foreign stocks and foreign etfs classified as stock in  in  the reporting rules will apply to most etfs and drips in addition to mutual funds in  the reporting requirements may also apply to derivatives and partnerships remember this does not apply to shares  investments bought before  you will still have to personally track the cost basis of these investments and report the realized gains and losses to the irs by the way these new irs reporting rules do not apply to taxsheltered

medical carecharitable ira donations are again permitted this isn’t an estate tax law per se but it factors into estate planning and it is certainly worth noting charitable ira rollovers are back in  we don’t know yet if they will be around in  there may be less financial incentive for families to make these rollovers given the much higher gift and estate tax exclusion this year but others will act on their altruismthe charitable ira rollover allows an ira owner age ½ or older to gift up to a total of  in ira assets to one or more qualified charities or nonprofit organizations a move that can count toward his or her annual rmd it has to be a direct transfer – the gift must pass directly from an ira sponsor to the charity the ira accountholder doesn’t get a tax deduction but he or she can potentially bypass the income tax on the distributioncharitable ira gifts made in january  can count for  the new law says that if you make a charitable ira transfer in january  you can elect to

however the irs has six years to challenge your return if it seems you under reported your gross income by  or more for most investments and banking statements the yearend statement is the most important if you have any investment liquidations that generated capital gains or losses you will want to keep the statements related to those transactions investment purchase information should be kept at least until the cost basis and purchase date is reflected on your account statements those figures will be used in future gainloss calculationsreal estate documents including closing statements mortgage information and expenses incurred to improve the property should be kept as long as you own the property once the property is sold keep documents showing the deed recording and the mortgage payoff receiptif you make any contributions receive distributions or rollover any iras or other qualified plans you’ll need to document those transactions the irs wants to make sure they receive any taxes due and will penalize violations if you anticipate needing to apply for medicaid you’ll want to keep fairly complete financial history documentation medicaid has a fiveyear lookback period in many states so to qualify for aid you have to prove that you didn’t transfer any assets except those specifically allowedas a reminder it’s a good idea to shred any documents you’re disposing that have personal information on them social security numbers active account numbers etc and while you’re sorting through all your files who knows – you may uncover some new projects that need attending to like updating your powers of attorney or completing a household inventory for your insurancehave any questions feel free to give us a call at  or send us an email at infohochmanandbakercom posted by hochman cole investment advisors inc at  pm no comments friday october   ira consolidation are you missing out on a chance to make your life simpler are you one of the many americans who has several retirement accounts were some of these rolled over from previous employers and held in a variety of places have you had years where you almost forgot about one or two of these accountsconsider consolidating your current ira accounts into a single account with your financial adviser you’ll find that eliminating multiple accounts may reduce fees charged by institutions for holding these iras makes monitoring performance easier and allows your financial adviser to take a more comprehensive approach to managing your portfolio in addition a consolidated account will make matters much clearer when you begin to take your required minimum distributionsremember to also speak with your financial adviser about any k plans you may still have with former employers these can be rolled into your ira which may provide many more options for investing as a selfdirected ira you will have access to a multitude of investment choices whereas most company plans offer less than twenty these additional options allow you to choose how you invest your money based on your individual preferences ie risk level expense costs exposure to specific industries time frames etc while company k plans have strong selling points such as company matching provisions when you are no longer working for that company they vanish the benefits of iras are numerous and are especially favorable to the alternative of keeping a plan with a former employer not only can a selfdirected ira be more easily coordinated with your other financial holdings but your beneficiaries have more flexibility with an ira beneficiaries of iras usually have the option to stretch receipt of distributions over their lifetimes and consequently the corresponding taxes but most company plans do not allow this option when stretch iras are not allowed a beneficiary will be required to take a lump sum distribution and pay income tax on the entire amount in that tax year this can be a tremendous burden and reduces the net inheritance considerably also if you are currently contributing to a k plan another option for you to consider is taking an inservice distribution although limited by the provisions of the plan these inservice distributions allow you to roll money from your company’s plan into your selfdirected ira which will provide you with more investment options for that qualified money it’s common for individuals to have too heavy a weighting of their employer’s stock in the k plan while company loyalty is admirable it is often wise to roll a portion of that holding out of the plan into an ira and reallocate to reduce risk it’s worth your time to think about consolidating your iras talk to your financial adviser and make sure you’ve considered your alternativesthis

tuesday march    college savings plans have you heard about the study conducted by the department agriculture expenditures on children by families they have been tracking the cost of raising a child since  and report that a twoparent middleincome family can expect to spend  they estimate from  to  per year for  years to raise a child born in  this figure is not adjusted for inflation nor does it include any college costs with the costs for raising a child so high a lot of people wonder how they can possibly afford to save money for their child’s education even if you can’t save a lot of money your children or grandchildren can still benefit greatly from a college savings plan one of the more popular ways to save for college is a  college savings plan these savings plans are managed by investment firms or state government agencies and provide a tax advantaged way to save for higher education a  savings plan is flexible—you can open a  plan for anyone a child a grandchild a friend and there are no income limits you can contribute up to   for married couples a year without gift tax consequences plans are administered by individual states but investors may choose any plan regardless of where they live also you can pay for educational expenses at any eligible institution not just schools in the state of the plan the tax advantages are the major draw for  plans the main tax advantages are that the principal grows taxdeferred and the distributions for qualified educational expenses are exempt from tax qualified educational expenses include tuition fees book supplies and equipment required for study at any accredited college university or vocational school the money can be used for room and board as long as the beneficiary is at least a halftime student if a distribution from a  plan is not used for a qualified education expenses then it is subject to income tax and possibly a  early distribution penalty though contributions are not deductible for federal income tax purposes many states provide state income tax deductions to find out more about saving for college check out this website that has tools for calculating college costs and more information

gross income limit for conversions to roth iras is eliminated also married taxpayers filing separate returns can now convert amounts into a roth ira for conversions in  any amounts required to be included in income are included in income in equal amounts in  and  you can elect to include the entire amount in income in benefits of conversionthe main difference between traditional ira and roth iras is the way in which the contributions and distributions are taxed contributions to traditional iras are tax deductible however you must pay taxes on the distributions contributions to roth iras are made on an aftertax basis and consequently you do not have to pay taxes on that money again distributions are tax free after age  ½ as long as you have had the roth ira for five years this is an attractive option for young investors as they will mostly likely be in a higher tax bracket in retirement than they are now however roth iras are not just for the young older investors can benefit from conversion to a roth especially if they do not have an immediate need for their ira assets if you name your spouse as the beneficiary of your roth ira your spouse can treat hisher inherited ira as their own and heshe will not be required to take withdrawals this provides an opportunity for further compounding for the rest of your spouse’s life then your spouse’s beneficiary a child or grandchild for example and heshe can then take withdrawals according to their life expectancy all the while the assets continue to compound tax freenote if you made aftertax contributions to your traditional ira then that portion of the total contributions can be distributed taxfree in the case of a conversion the tax on the ira assets would be solely on the portion of the beforetax contributionsconversion drawbacksa conversion from a traditional to a roth ira is a taxable event you can pay taxes on the conversion amount out of the ira or with outside funds however if you are under  ½ paying the tax from the ira would result in a  penalty the good news as mentioned above is that you can divide the taxes between your  and  tax returns consult your financial advisorbefore you arrange for any rollover or conversion it is a good idea to consult a financial advisor each person’s financial circumstances are different and any tax consequences should be fully understood
