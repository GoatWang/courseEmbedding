star in april  njmc purchased the eastern star project from premium exploration inc the property consists of  patented mining claims covering  acres near elk city idaho the elk city mining district is an historic gold mining region dating back to the s that once supported more than  mines including the eastern star along with placer dredging operations modern exploration in the district by companies including cypressamax kinross gold and bema gold has focused on nearsurface bulk tonnage potential while the many smallerscale highgrade gold occurrences have largely been ignored at the eastern star highgrade samples were previously collected by premium from three separate locations representing nearly onehalf mile of mineralized trend of  premium grab samples nine returned gold values greater than  ounces per ton opt recent rock chip sampling by njmc confirmed the widespread presence of highgrade gold within mineralized quartz vein material of  samples collected by njmc  returned gold values exceeding  opt with five of those exceeding  opt the samples were collected over a broad area representing multiple vein zones individual samples from five of the zones assayed greater than  opt gold two samples from a previously unprospected area returned gold values of  opt and  opt a sample from another previously unprospected area returned  opt gold njmc has followedup with additional rock chip sampling and  feet of surface trenching to help trace structures and map vein locations as there is little exposed outcrop on the property the eastern star lies within trucking distance to the new jersey mill in kellogg fitting the company’s nearterm objective of evaluating highgrade systems for production potential as well as its longerterm vision of possibly building a new mill capable of servicing an emerging mining district as local operations are developed new jersey mines new jersey minesiron ore is abundant in northern new jersey and iron interests have been active since the areas earliest history the elizabeth mine one of a number of iron ore operations that comprised the mount hope mine owned by the mount hope mining company in  years of sporadic operation since  the mount hope mine produced about  million tons of iron ore and from its forge and furnace cast iron products such as revolutionary war cannonballs much of the ore came from the elizabeth mine which ran  feet deep the  iron ore veins of the mount hope mine outcropped jutted out from the ground aiming in a northeast direction they dove deep into the earth mining started in open pits on the surface then went underground with the ore vein one of the submines went down  feet the new leonard mine put into operation during world war iias far back as the early s the name andover was used by the penns owners of a large tract here granted to them by the proprietors to refer to the whole general area over the years various sites have borne the andover name including local iron mines forges furnaces factories and settlements with a connection with these early iron interests old andover was the prerevolutionary war site later known as waterloo village about  miles south of our presentday town of andover around  the loyalist iron company of allen  turner erected at old andover an iron furnace forge and refinery andover received its name from the birthplace of mr turner which was andover county hampshire england the company mined its iron ore along a ridge a couple of miles north of where the town of andover now lies there they also built a furnace gristmill blacksmithshop barn dwellings and a mansion for the superintendent of the iron works the pig iron produced there was then sent to the old andover forge and refinery at waterloo to be made into bars that were then transported on mules to the delaware river for shipment or use elsewhere the earliest nonaboriginal inhabitants of the present township of andover were the ironworkers and miners brought here by allen  turner probably a combination of slaves and indentured immigrants the sussex mine railroad chartered on march   was the predecessor of the sussex railroad that was to be used for the sole purpose of hauling iron ore from the andover mine the narrow gauge railway was drawn by mules from the andover mine down to the morris canal at waterloo village and was then taken on to the thomas iron furnaces in allentown pennsylvania the act by the new jersey legislature that incorporated the railroad also allowed for the provision of extending the rail into newton the county seatthe andover mine should not be confused with the andover tunnel which is a major part of the mines at hibernia in morris county the workings share the name because both were owned by the andover iron company of phillipsburg new jersey having been worked since before the revolutionary war the andover mine is probably the original in this group during the civil war andovers high quality iron was made into steel for military firearmsthe iron industry drastically changed the landscape throughout northwest new jersey most people assume that the land was cleared by farmers but it was iron companies that did much of the original clearing for wood to be converted into charcoal fuel for blast furnaces for the fuel demands of an active furnace as much as an acre of wood a day was cut and used for charcoal production farmers later took advantage and established fields in which to grow their crops on the precleared landtthe beach glen mine dates back to at least  as this was the year a charcoal forge was built in the vicinity however it was not until  that mining here was documented at this time minor surface mining took place and it was likely abandoned shortly after this date the mine was worked on and off from  on when two openings were made  feet apart in  at a depth of  feet a rich magnetite vein was discovered  feet wide yielding  to to  percent iron up to this point only lean ore had been found  tons of ore were removed but the plummeting price of ore closed the mine again in  the mine reopened in  working sporatically until the basis of new jersey zincs business was a zincironmanganese ore body formed by geological processes that took place over one billion years ago in the northwestern corner of the state the area is unique containing over  minerals of which  are found nowhere else in the world moreover the ore body became commercially viable through an accident of nature erosion exposed the deposits in the precambrian period which were then covered by paleozoic sediment and later eroded by glacial activity the result was that deposits were readily visible to european settlers by  not long after the establishment of the nieuw amsterdam settlement the natural outcrops had been discovered and were being explored the franklin mine passed through a number of owners including king charles ii of england and william penn and a group of investors in  the earl of stirling made failed attempts to extract zinc from the ore body although he did produce iron which would become a mainstay of the local economy late into the s a number of parties worked the franklinsterling deposits from  to  but no one was able to successfully separate the zinc in  the sussex zinc  copper mining  manufacturing company was formed four years later it developed the first commercially viable way to smelt the ore to produce zinc oxide also in that year sussex zinc changed its name to the new jersey zinc company it began selling zinc oxide to the paint industry as a nontoxic substitute for lead leading to the rise of readymixed paints zinc oxide also became an important compound in the rubber industry not only serving as a reinforcing agent but as a way to cut the curing time of rubber with the birth of the automobile and the need for tires and the increased need for other rubber goods zinc oxide would take on an even greater significance starting in  zinc oxide would also play an important role in the cosmetics industry new jersey zinc also attempted to recover metallic zinc from the franklinsterling deposits but it wasnt until  that the company was able to produce commercial slab zinc some ten years earlier because of these efforts the company had been able to create a second product spiegeleisen german for mirror iron an ironmanganese alloy used in the manufacture of manganese steel the company was not alone however in working the franklinsterling outcrop and conflicting deeds of ownership caused considerable legal wrangling from  to  the new jersey zinc company fought a legal battle with moses taylors franklin iron company a dispute that was finally resolved in  by merging the two companies into the new jersey zinc and iron companyfinally in  new jersey zinc was able to consolidate the areas mining and smelting operations and begin to build a worldclass businessin  the remaining franklin district companies were consolidated under the umbrella of the new jersey zinc company led by stephen s palmer the palmer family controlled the company for  years until the death of stephens son edgar in  when the estate of edgar palmer was forced to sell its controlling interest in order to pay inheritance taxesthe new jersey zinc company was the largest employer in sussex county and paid one third of property taxes in sussex county providing steady employment for many peopleat its peak the company owned and operated smelters and mines across the us and canadasterling hill is one of the oldest mines in the united states and was first worked sometime before  more than  years ago from  to  two surface pits at sterling hill were worked for hemimorphite a valuable zinc ore mineral these pits called the noble mine and the passaic mine remain visible today the hemimorphite formed during prolonged weathering of the primary zinc ores and formed thick coatings on rock surfaces wherever sufficient open space existed for its formation during the early s the south end of the sterling hill deposit was worked for iron ore the ore there is dominantly franklinite a zinciron oxide of variable composition toward the south end of sterling hill the franklinite ran unusually high in iron and correspondingly low in zinc and thus made a good iron ore the presence of some manganese in the ore was beneficial because it made the iron recovered by smelting much tougher and less brittleby far the dominant ore minerals at sterling hill are franklinite a zinciron oxide willemite a zinc silicate and zincite zinc oxide most of the underground mining of these ores postdates the great consolidation of  when disparate mining interests at sterling hill and franklin were united under the new jersey zinc company prior to that time most mining of these ores was restricted to small open pits and shallow underground workings but after consolidation the orebody was mined in earnest ultimately to a depth of more than half a mile below the surface sterling hill production redoubled after closure of the franklin mine in  and continued almost unabated until the mine closed in  most of the  million tons of zinc ore recovered from sterling hill postdates the  consolidation of mining interestsfranklin furnace is a famous mineral location for rare zinc iron manganese minerals in old mines in franklin new jersey usa this locale produced more species of minerals over  and more different fluorescent minerals than any other location the famous mineral association assemblage from franklin includes willemite zincite and frankliniteduring the mid to late s the furnace was the center of a large iron making operation the furnace mine which was adjacent to the actual furnace was a  foot vertical shaft just under franklin fallssterling mine  sterling hill borough of ogdensburg sussex county njelizabeth adit of mount hope mine  njmount hope mine  njbeach glen mine  rockaway township njan early iron mine the peters was most likely opened in  by the ogden family and operated from  until the end of the revolutionary war during this time the mine was worked through shafts and an adit the mine was reopened in  and again in  when  tons of ore had already been produced most if it during colonial times the mine closed again sometime before  in  an opening was made called the new peter mine which was being worked together with a pit which in  was described as being  feet long by  feet wide both openings worked shoots of ore that joined slightly below the surface in  a new shoot had been discovered but

further down by  by  the mine had reached a total depth of  feet and contained  levels working multiple shoots of rich magnetite ore containing as much as  iron however small amounts of hematite were
