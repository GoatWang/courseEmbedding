vice president and chief financial officer and meredith kopit levien executive vice president and chief revenue officer before we begin i would like to remind you that management will make forwardlooking statements during the course of this call and our actual results could differ materially some of the risks and uncertainties that could impact our business are included in our  k in addition our presentation will include nongaap financial measures and we have provided reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures in our earnings press release which is available on our website at investorsnytcocom with that i will turn the call over to mark thompson mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director thanks andrea and good morning everyone in fact i want to preface my remarks with a development that took place after the second quarter closed a few days ago our digitalonly subscriber count passed through the  million mark its a very encouraging milestone for digital pay model which only launched in  and which continues to grow strongly its also a first in world journalism we believe that no other news organization has achieved digital subscriber numbers like ours or comparable digital subscription revenue a great credit to the sheer quality of the work of our newsroom and editorial department and to the brilliant consumer marketing product and technology teams who have made it possible this digitalonly subscriber number is of course in addition to our  million print and digital subscribers this news is evidence of the progress we are making on the digital side of our business that progress was clear in the second quarter of  to which i will now turn we posted doubledigit yearoveryear growth in both digital advertising and digital subscription revenue in q this is the fourth consecutive quarter of doubledigit growth in digital advertising revenue the print advertising headwinds that began in late  also continued into q though we saw some reduction in those headwinds in july nonetheless ongoing and effective expense management contributed to a  increase in the companys adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share of  compared with  in the prior year so lets now take a closer look at our q results beginning with digital subscriptions in q we added  net paid subscribers which is a better result for the second quarter than we saw in either of the past two years that means that we ended q with  paid digitalonly subscribers a  yearoveryear increase and thats why we were able to exceed a  million subs early in the current quarter the growth in q is particularly pleasing since it includes the impact of our decision to convert nyt now into a free product although we were successful in migrating many now subscribers to core subscriptions some understandably elected to continue to use now for free had it not been for this onetime effect the number of net new subscribers would have been higher still the digital consumer growth in the second quarter was driven by growing strength in international subscriptions as well as improved retention international subs now represent  of our digital total a percentage which we expect will continue to grow very nicely in the coming quarters as i mentioned last quarter the results of the program we put in place in the second half of  to develop our audience so far have been very encouraging and are contributing to the continued growth in digital subscriptions us digital traffic for instance in the form of unduplicated unique users across all devices was up  yearoveryear in the second quarter which was even better than the solid  increase we saw in q to an average of  million monthly users we aim to continue on this trajectory and we expect these results to help both digital advertising and consumer revenue over time let me focus now on digital advertising where we also saw continued momentum in the quarter with yearonyear growth of more than  mobile paid posts video and programmatic all contributed to that growth i also want to provide an update on the ad viewability issue that we introduced to you last quarter this is the new industrywide effort to ensure that advertisers only pay for impressions that have actually been viewed by users given the quality and engagement of the timess audience we expect this new standard to benefit our digital advertising proposition in the long run and we are currently optimizing our digital properties to meet it but as i suggested last quarter we may see a moderate revenue impact in the second half of  as we transition to the new standard digital advertising revenue will also face challenging yearoveryear comparisons in the second half of the year q  for example was up  while q  was up  for these two reasons we expect growth in digital advertising to be somewhat lower in the second half of the year than the first in q we estimate you will see it will grow in the mid singledigit percentage range jim will put this piece of guidance in context in a few minutes time we remain very bullish on our ability to continue to innovate and grow our digital advertising business on a sustained basis earlier this week for instance we announced the launch of a major new mobile ad product mobile moments is an advertising solution based on the insight that our readers appetite for different kinds of content and the attendant advertising opportunity changes radically across the course of the day from the early morning need to get caught up on the news through the working day to the evening when entertainment lifestyle and longer features may all come to the fore mobile moments enables marketers to target the right readers with the right messages at the right time and while we wont launch it until next month its already selling strongly but now lets look more closely at the print side of our business as i said at the start the print advertising headwinds that began in late  continued into the second quarter print ended down  yearoveryear which includes steeper falls in advertising for our international newspaper as well as some foreign currency effects when combined with the gains in digital advertising the overall advertising decline was  as i mentioned at the start we do expect print advertising headwinds to ease a bit in the third quarter while growth in digital subscriptions enabled overall circulation revenue to grow in the quarter by just under  there was a decline in print circulation revenue of  as lower volume more than offset the positive effects of our january price increase nonetheless similar to the digital consumer side we are putting more emphasis on print circulation retention including increased focus on our delivery service experience better use of customer analytics and improved customer service and hope to report progress on this front soon since our last earnings call we have entered into three important relationships all of which we believe will help us to reach large new audiences with our unparalleled journalism facebooks instant articles is already under way and for the initial test audience has resulted in significantly reduced article load times and thus improved reader experience apple news will launch later this year and will also allow us also to distribute our content to millions of potential new readers and we also announced a deal with starbucks last month that will make our top news and a selection of other articles available for free via the starbucks mobile app for all  million starbucks loyalty members beginning in the first half of next year we expect all of these platforms to contribute to our digital audience and revenue growth story we also made some additional leadership announcements in the second quarter building on the executive appointments i announced earlier this year we have created a new role called senior vice president of consumer marketing who will supervise an already strong marketing team and will aim to accelerate subscription growth across our expansive product portfolio and we have also brought in an svp for our events business nyt live who will assume responsibility for the commercial aspects of all times conferences timestalks and other live events both of these positions will report to meredith but now to give you more detail on the financial picture let me hand you over to jim follo james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you mark and good morning everyone as mark highlighted we maintained our digital momentum in q as we again saw strong performance on both the digital advertising and digital subscription sides of the business there is still much to do to accomplish though as even this solid digital progress did not offset the overall print declines which resulted in total revenues finishing down for the quarter operating expenses decreased again in the second quarter by nearly  million overall due to print distribution efficiencies and declines in a broad set of other expense categories furthermore cost comparisons benefited as marketing spend that occurred in the second quarter of  around the launch of some new digital products did not repeat our focus on reducing legacy costs remains a top priority but as i have said previously we do not expect to see the same level of cost reductions in the second half of the year as we achieved in the first half adjusted operating profit rose  in the quarter to  million we reported gaap operating profit of approximately  million compared to  million in the same period of  circulation revenues increased approximately  with our digital subscription revenue stream more than offsetting print declines we benefited from januarys homedelivery price increases although higher revenue associated with the new rates was outweighed by overall print volume declines in the second quarter digitalonly subscription revenues were approximately  million an increase of  of the same quarter in  advertising continued its strong digital run in the quarter finishing up  and partially offsetting the print advertising decline of  digital advertising continued to benefit from revenue growth in mobile paid posts including related production video and programmatic but the print losses still led to an overall advertising decline of  the monthtomonth volatility in advertising has not abated as illustrated by the fact that overall advertising was down  in april  in may and  in june print advertising revenue declined across the board while digital was consistently strong particularly in april and finally on the revenue side other revenues grew  in the quarter driven by higher revenues from our crossword product where we recently increased prices as well as increased rental income associated with the lease of an additional floor of our headquarters building that began in q expense management remained front and center in q as we continued to target cost reductions while maintaining investment in our digital future costs were down  on a gaap basis and we reported diluted earnings per share of  expenses declined mainly due to production distribution efficiencies as well as decreases in depreciation and amortization raw materials costs and outside printing expenses adjusted diluted earnings per share was  in the quarter compared to  in the prior year our nonoperating retirement costs were up in the quarter at  million although retirement costs are generally flattening out in  we expect nonoperating retirement costs in the third quarter to again be approximately  million vs  million in q of  the joint venture line had a loss of approximately  in the second quarter  due to losses at the paper mills compared to a small income in last years second quarter in q  we also made a  million investment in women in the world led by tina brown whose annual summit brings together female leaders from around the world as for the balance sheet our liquidity position remained solid in the second quarter our cash and marketable security balance was  million and our total cash position exceeded total debt and capital lease obligations by approximately  million late in the first quarter we repaid the remaining  million principal amount of our  senior notes and we began to recognize the full benefit of that repayment in q as interest expense declined by more than  million we expect similar expense savings related to the repayment for the remainder of  earlier this year as part of a warrant exercise we announced the intention to make share repurchases of approximately  million equal to the proceeds received from the warrant transaction as weve said we believe a repurchase program is the best use of cash in this instance as it will largely neutralize the transactions impact on our diluted share count to that end the company has repurchased approximately  million class a shares for approximately  million todate as of august  moving to our outlook thirdquarter circulation revenues are expected to increase at a rate similar to the second quarter trend driven by the benefit from our digital subscription revenue growth despite continued challenges on the print side we expect the total number of net digital subscriber additions to be in the high s third quarter advertising are difficult to forecast because as typical at this time of year we have limited visibility into september which contributes a disproportionate share of the quarterly revenue that said we currently expect overall advertising revenue to again be down in the midsingle digits though with some sequential improvement from q we are seeing some moderation in the headwinds weve been experiencing on the print side but as mark has already said the impact of viewability and tough yearoveryear comparisons means that we expect digital advertising will grow in the mid single digits and other revenues are expected to increase in the lowdouble digits third quarter operating costs are expected to decline in the low single digits as we will be cycling  million in severance expense in last years third quarter and adjusted operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down in the quarter and with that wed be happy to open it up for questions questionandanswer session operator your first question is from doug arthur with huber research your line is open douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc yeah thanks jim when you say sequential improvement in the third quarter youre talking about sort of nuances on mid single digit decline versus q is that fair james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president well i would suggest i think that q advertising number is down negative  so we are suggesting it will be below that number but it still puts it in the mid single digit down range douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc okay and then just a followup mark can you or meredith talk about just sort of your initial experience with making new york times now free how that sort of affected – what kind of traction its getting and obviously its not having much of an impact i mean bad impact in terms of digital sub growth paid growth so how is that playing out versus your expectation mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director just on the last point on the digital subscription story i think that we had a oneoff effect obviously at flipping it from subscription to free but actually we were pretty happy with the conversion rate of now subscribers and the intention of doing it was to promote now as a free experience of times journalism and to encourage as many people to use it were pretty happy with the now story it had a slight impact on our q overall subscriber ads but to be honest even with that impact weve gotten a high number of net digital subscribers this year than we had a year ago at the point where now was launching as a subscription product so i feel very good that the core subscription and our superior marketing tactics and in particular the growing success were having internationally means that the digital subscription story is very strong at the moment and weve now freed now to find its audience meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director do you want to talk about any initial thoughts about how now is doing meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah sure i mean i will just say that we did a bit better that we expected on converting i think slightly more than half of the now subscribers to bundle a so thats good and we see now as part of a broader effort to grow audience with some limited amount of free content that brings new audiences to the times and were excited about it and i think the fact that we were able to put up a brisk second quarter in digital subs while this is going on is a very promising sign douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc great thank you operator the next question is from bill bird with fbr your line is open bill g bird  fbr capital markets  co good morning i was wondering if youd talk a little more about how the facebook instant articles program is going could it enable another spurt in digital sub growth because of sampling and then separately with cash continuing to build what are your thoughts on how you might deploy cash thank you meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer im happy to take facebook jim can take cash in general ill say this is very much an experiment we think its a deliberate and important experiment for us and that the basic idea is threefold one to keep growing the times we know we have to keep growing the audience for the times and we see facebook as a good way to do that its bringing new audiences to us if we look at who uses us on facebook it tends to be folks who are not already subscribers to the times so were excited about that and two i would say we are playing a long game here and trying to make sure we understand and have access to some of the best information at the frontier of consumer media experience and how people engage with content on social platforms is a very important part of that mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director and its worth saying that i mean were really focused on every bit of the funnel from the top to the bottom meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director all the way through from the first touch point we have with a user through to someone becoming a full longterm subscriber i mean i think if you ask me i think we think that the – i mean a lot of our fundamental audience developments is quite high up the funnel meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yes mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director i think were going to learn over time how we can use our platform partnerships like facebook instant articles and where in the funnel that helps us but as you probably saw already we think weve got quite a few significant growth drivers already at work in our digital subscription business and which is why were pretty bullish about progress on that front meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer and were making a deliberate choice to sort of do more work at the top of the funnel and we would say what were doing with facebook and apple and starbucks and nyt now are all a part of that mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director correct thats right cash james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president on the cash side is were executing on our  million share repurchase so were about  million into that well continue and we expect to execute on that fully look were mindful of that issue its top of mind i dont feel like we have anything more to report what i will say is were not putting cash towards our pension obligations were still pretty confident that those things will take care of themselves we hope through interest rate rises and well have to continue to evaluate use of cash our debt position continues to come down we do have a maturity towards the end of next year about  million which well evaluate as we get a little bit closer to that point but we continue to evaluate use of cash and were very careful with the way we deploy it but right now we like where were positioned bill g bird  fbr capital markets  co and just an addon on the digital subscribers is the slight uptick in digital subscriber additions in q do you attribute that more to seasonality or is there some other thing going on meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer i would say its three things – four things actually one better international growth and thats from rolling out more incurrency billing and also marketing more effectively to international customers we also saw brisk business in groups of corporate and education subscriptions we are seeing better retention and i would say broadly were executing better and we think all of those things will continue mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director yeah i just want to say – ive mentioned weve just been joined by clay fisher as the new head of direct marketing and he came from directv we think theres plenty of opportunity to continue to improve the way we market our digital subscriptions and the whole complete customer lifetime value piece from the moment they become a customer and retention and so forth so plenty more work to do but whats encouraging i think were now seeing what we started something like  months ago in areas like retention in international is really paying off so were very encouraged by that meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah and i would say theres still good distance to be travelled in all of those areas mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director yeah bill g bird  fbr capital markets  co great thank you operator your next question is from john janedis with jefferies your line is open john janedis  jefferies llc thank you meredith this maybe is for you you talked about plans – i think it was in the press to introduce a video version of mobile ads can you talk more about that opportunity and what it could mean longer term for modernization to mobile meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer sure we are hugely focused on mobile right now and mark just talked about the mobile moments product that we launched this week that is a product that is enabled for basically any format a marketer wants to use including video and i expect well have a meaningful amount of video in that weve also done some work on our tech stack to make – frankly selling mobile video advertising an easier thing here so im optimistic about that and then i would say in branded content video has been one of the areas where weve been most successful so video in two ways either developing short films with informed marketers or developing major multimedia storytelling instances that include video as a major part of them and so its a huge area of focus for us john janedis  jefferies llc got it and mark meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer and if you look at our most recent paid posts most of them have video in them and most of them are optimized theyre all actually optimized for a mobile experience john janedis  jefferies llc all right thanks meredith mark you talked about your digital and print subscriber count i think youre now at a point where your reach is probably something in the range of a top  cable network and yeah i know theres no perfect overlap in advertisers but is there any kind of opportunity to compete for wallet with cable networks given the ratings issues theyre having more as your reach is more stable mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director i think thats really interesting and i mean in a sense i think part of this is a question about the counterparty the advertising industry and to what extent the advertising industry is prepared to be more – and indeed ultimate for customers marketers – are prepared to be openminded but as platforms come together i think this kind of opportunity absolutely looms large for us so yes definitely i think but meredith do you want to add to that meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah i would agree with that i would say the number of entities and the nature of entities that were competing with is far more broad than its ever been and to the question i was just asked video is becoming a much more meaningful part of our solution set for advertisers and it will continue to get bigger and that will put us in direct competition with those coming from the television space mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director and whats interesting about this to me is i think the traditional or kind of recent kind of fixed narrative about newspapers is that they are the victims of new entrants competing with them i think your suggestion is a really good example there as where we can ourselves be disruptors and can get in and get dollars out of advertising markets which were historically closed to us meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer thats right john janedis  jefferies llc thank you operator your next question is from craig huber with huber research your line is open craig a huber  huber research partners llc yes good morning i missed a little bit about what you said about the slower growth for digital ad revenue in at least the third quarter if not the back half of the year you really talked about a new standard i was wondering if you could just go over that a little bit further please meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer sure ill take that and jim you can fill in anything i miss so were coming off a full year of double digit digital advertising increases and in the third quarter of last year we grew  so were comping against very strong period of growth in q in addition to that james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president and it is  in q meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer  right so a full half year of strong growth in addition to that we have been working to make viewability a meaningful part of our ongoing operation so essentially optimizing our site for the viewability standard that the ad market is seeking and as we cycle through that we expect viewability to have some impact in the near term on revenue less so over time as it just becomes standard operating procedure but those two things and also frankly a whole lot of uncertainty about september and its always this way about september because september is such a big month lead us to give the guidance weve given james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director its worth saying then i tried to say this in my remarks that we also feel that weve got real growth drivers in place in digital advertising meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer absolutely mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director lots of innovation our branded content business is going great guns really striking growth there i mentioned mobile moments thats part of a broader story of innovation in mobile advertising were very encouraged by the track of mobile advertising and the way the percentage of digital advertising coming to mobile is growing very rapidly so weve got one or two specific issues which are to do with comps and viewability the bigger story we think about digital advertising remains an extremely encouraging one meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah and ill just add to that on mobile specifically we in the second quarter we actually went from about  of our digital advertising business coming from mobile to a full  and we think that number should only go up as we launch this new suite of premium mobile products so were very encouraged by what were seeing there and theres a lot of demand in the market craig a huber  huber research partners llc along those same lines please could you also just talk about potentially how much of a problem it might be coming here with more and more people using these advertising blockers on mobile devices and then also on desktop and i understand that apple with iphone is likely going to allow that to be downloaded here soon how much of a problem is that for your business but also for the whole ecosystem as well that are advertisingfocused meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah i think its a real issue for the ecosystem and i we like everybody else are trying to understand what impact it will have on our supply it has not had a material impact on supply so far certainly becomes a bigger issue with what youve just described but i think we feel pretty good about the fact that a lot of the new products were putting out in the market are more native to the experience to the journalistic experience and that may allow us to get around some of the pressure that ad blockers would otherwise provide craig a huber  huber research partners llc and then also a nitpick question can you just talk a little further about how digital and print ad revenue did in the month of july yearoveryear can you quantify it for us if you would meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer sure sure we saw – we had a betterthanexpected july in print actually yearoveryear as a month better performance than we had seen in some time so optimistic about that and we grew in digital in july as well so i think in general july will be a good month james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah and look the comps on digital really i mean were up  meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer  yeah james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah  in july so its not a clean indicative month meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president but as weve said the month of september makes our quarter its  percentage of total revenues its not quite  but its in the s of the total revenue so you really got to be mindful of that we dont have a ton of visibility there but were up to a decent start meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer pretty good start james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president but thats somewhat embedded in our guidance that we gave this morning meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah craig a huber  huber research partners llc good my last little question please daily and sunday print circulation volume what was that percent changes yearoveryear please meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer daily is down  sunday is down  and i think thats consistent with the prior quarter craig a huber  huber research partners llc great thank you operator your next question is from kannan venkateshwar with barclays your line is open kannan venkateshwar  barclays capital inc thank you just one question from my side jim on the margin side of it now digital is i think close to  million for you guys in the quarter and obviously events is growing at a faster clip than the rest of the business so when you think about the contribution margin from the newer revenue sources versus the legacy revenue sources how should we think about the impact of that on margins especially as you go more to mobile and video and so on and so forth james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president id say its a pretty complicated story and it depends – look i think broadly speaking obviously digital as a business doesnt come with the big kind of legacy cost that digital does but theres dynamics around digital and in certain cases that come with cost that maybe print doesnt for example margin or certain aspects of digital advertising could be slightly lower to print when we lose print advertising we regularly say it comes out at  paid posts for example is production cost behind that but its still very highmargin business but  margin is  margin on print so look i think – you know look we continue – as the digital business grows rapidly we continue to invest quite a bit behind that so the payback on that investment comes a year or two years later so you dont fully feel the margin expansion early on in a growing business like you might otherwise but look were going to have to continue to be pretty aggressive in taking cost out on the print side were very focused on margin and protecting margin in the business and well have to – well continue to be aggressive particularly on the print side in taking cost out meredith kopit levien  executive vice president  chief revenue officer yeah mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director yeah if i can just a second im just saying i mean you can see from the q results that we are focusing very hard on the cost side while investing enough to build digital business we absolutely believe that the digital transition that were going through in this company requires us to have a strategic view about our cost base and about longrange future margin and thats a large focus of management attention as well as the business of growing digital revenue and i have seen nothing yet that suggests to me that it will not be possible for us to effectively defend margin as we make through some transition and by the way to do that whilst still maintaining the quality of the journalism that the times produces kannan venkateshwar  barclays capital inc yeah i mean just to followup on that i mean if i look at the margin expansion that you saw this quarter or the – just in general the job that you guys have been doing with cost cuts thats obviously helped a lot on the margin side of it but the operating leverage that you would expect from the digital side initially is obviously capped by all the investments you guys have made but as we go forward and as you lap those investments just wondering from a timing perspective when we start seeing that operating leverage now that costs to a certain extent are optimized and you continue that process and then you have these new revenue lines which keep adding on the margin side of it so when we go into  and so on should we expect the profile of the business from a margin perspective to be different compared to what it is today james m follo  chief financial officer  executive vice president a lot of that tends to be driven by our view of advertising and as i said because its such a volatile ad market that the margin discussion tends to be around what our view of the mix of our business is between consumer and print and then even within advertising digital and print and as i said earlier when you lose a dollar or you gain a dollar of revenue its coming in at  so it has a big impact on the margin story so if we can grow advertising youll see margin expansion when theres pressure on advertising it puts a lot pressure as it costs out mark j t thompson  president chief executive officer  director without getting too philosophical about it i think another way to look at this is the question as to what extent you can grow your engaged audience a significant number of the costs your – for example your journalism costs in a highquality digital journalism business are relatively fixed costs there are critical strategic questions about how much you can grow not just your headline audience but your engaged audience and your paying audience and thats what a significant part of our focus on what i described earlier as the funnel is around issue of how you grow and how you accelerate growth in your audience because in the end if you can get a strongly grown audience and maintaining engagement measured by time spent and are effectively marketing and managing the funnel with that audience you have a chance of growing your audience sufficiently to get a great margin story kannan venkateshwar
