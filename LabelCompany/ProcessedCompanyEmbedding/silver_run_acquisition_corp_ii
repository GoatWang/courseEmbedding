energy natural resourcessummarysilver run acquisition corp a special purpose acquisition corp spac completed its ipo raising  million in the processsrun priced  million units and  million warrants at share and closed at  in its first day of trading on march srun backed by riverstone partners features management including james hackett former ceo of anadarko petroleum and other ep cos spanning a year careersimilar to centennial resource development a  ipo units offer investors a nearly free look at the initial transaction to be proposed by the companyparticularly in a lower for longer environment the units are a good speculation on managements ability to perform and a worthy competitor in the ep industry to followas yogi berra once said its like déjà vu all over again readers may recognize something familiar about the name silver run acquisition corp from an ipo last year and my article summarizing its terms and business prospects the original silver run after a business combination morphed the company into what is now known as centennial resource development nasdaqcdev this company silver run acquisition corp ii srun is an entirely different company as observant readers slightly facetiously will notice by the ii designation like cdev srun is a spac or special purpose acquisition company sponsored by riverstone partners an ep asset manager with over  billion invested riverstone was founded in  by david lueschen and pierre lapeyre both former goldman sachs nysegs investment bankers most of their funds are private equity investments on behalf of institutional clients and srun is no exception riverstones contribution discussed below will be made on behalf of their fund vi besides the scope and experience of riverstone the srun offering relies on an experienced ep executive james hackett mr hacketts bio is set forth below james t hackett will serve as our chief executive officer and a director upon completion of this offering mr hackett is a partner at riverstone prior to joining riverstone in  mr hackett served as the chairman of the board from  to  and the chief executive officer from  to  of anadarko petroleum corporation before joining anadarko mr hackett served as president and chief operating officer of devon energy corporation following its merger with ocean energy where he had served as chairman president and chief executive officer mr hackett has held senior positions at seagull duke energy and pan energy he also held positions in engineering finance and marketing in the midstream oil field services and power sectors of the energy industry mr hackett serves on the board of directors of enterprise products holdings llc fluor corporation nyse flr national oilwell varco inc nyse nov sierra oil and gas and talen energy corporation mr hackett is a former chairman of the board of the federal reserve bank of dallas mr hackett received a bachelor of science degree from the university of illinois in  and an mba from harvard business school in  mr hackett was selected to serve on the board of directors due to his significant leadership experience and his extensive experience in the energy industry while other officers and directors are specified in the prospectus those individuals all also served in similar capacities in the initial silver run company until the combination that created cdev sruns business strategy objective is very flexible and broad but i would expect any transactions to be primarily for the purpose of securing ep assets while cdevs ceo mark papa had broad experience in onshore oil and gas it should be noted that mr hacketts expertise also included companies with significant offshore assets including anadarko devon ocean and seagull that is not to say that the offshore arena would be an area of focus but it is one possibility also although it is possible that srun could acquire assets or companies from other riverstone funds that is not the expectation i would note in that regard that one of riverstones other portfolio companies fieldwood energy is the largest operator of shallow gulf of mexico properties acquiring assets from apache corp nyseapa and sandridge nysesd for over  billion fieldwood debt has recently been restructured by riverstone again i do not expect that the specific strategy of srun is to acquire fieldwood even if it were riverstone would have to obtain a fairness opinion to proceed such a transaction would also give rise to an investor put as described below which would allow investors to require srun to buy back their shares the offering itself was for  mm srun units at  per share comprised of one share and a warrant to purchase  share at  per share the warrants can be exercised beginning at the earlier of the date of the initial business combination or  months from the date of the offering and the units can be redeemed by srun at such time as the share price exceeds  per share for  days this redemption is occurring now with respect to cdev the units traded under the symbol srunu will become separately tradeable  days after the offering under the symbols srun and srunw respectively the net proceeds from the offering will be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of shareholders other than  million attributable to equity that is not returnable to investors in the event that no acceptable business combination is completed within  months until an initial business combination is proposed those funds will be considered as part of redeemable securities that investors may choose to require srun to repurchase at the time the initial transaction is proposed so in effect investors will get a nearly free look at the proposed combination transaction the only deduction being the common equity component above riverstone will own  of sruns shares giving them an incentive to make sure the transaction it proposes passes muster with investors it will acquire those shares for only nominal consideration in essence similar to a private equity hedge fund deal where a percentage goes to the sponsor for its efforts in addition in a significant additional consideration riverstones fund vi has issued a forward commitment to purchase  million in common shares and warrants  million shares plus  million warrants at  per share at the time of the initial transaction in effect giving them a benefit if the share price rises and delaying their actual outlay of cash with the  million raised in the ipo and a  million additional commitment however srun will have substantial equity capital and no debt an enviable negotiating position going forward in summary sruns offering allows investors to potentially profit from advantageous business transactions in the future while not exposing much of their initial investment as risk capital until a potential transaction is identified and a combination proposed at which time investors have the option to either leave their shares untouched or tender them back to srun in this market where a lower for longer mantra seems to be gaining credence as far as oil and gas pricing goes such an approach might be very attractive for investors to consider although this is a short article the investment characteristics are fairly straightforward and comparable to the cdev transactions which has performed very well and which i have previously owned as such srun seems to me to be a worthwhile speculation and a company i would expect to follow closely in the future in addition to stocks mentioned in the article readers might consider the following

including franchise taxes    total      includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business combination  a portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan from our sponsor of  as described in this prospectus this amount will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions and amounts not to be held in the trust account in the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table any such amounts will be used for postclosing working capital expenses in the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account  the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to  of the gross proceeds of this offering upon completion of our initial business combination  which constitutes the underwriters deferred commissions or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining funds less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital the underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify a business combination target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a no shop provision and commitment fees for financing the rules of nasdaq provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants  or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full including  or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full of deferred underwriting commissions will be placed in a usbased trust account at jp morgan chase bank na with continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately  per year assuming an interest rate of  per year however we can provide no assurance regarding this amount except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of a the completion of our initial business combination b the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and c the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law based on current interest rates we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account net of income taxes will be sufficient to pay delaware franchise taxes the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us commencing on the date of this prospectus we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of  per month for office space utilities and secretarial and administrative support upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation we will cease paying these monthly fees our sponsor has loaned us  to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering this loan is noninterest bearing unsecured and is due at the earlier of march   or the closing of this offering the loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds not held in the trust account in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants including as to exercise price exercisability and exercise period the terms of such loans by our officers and directors if any have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans prior to the completion of our initial business combination we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account we have entered into a forward purchase agreement with fund vi holdings pursuant to which it has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our class a common stock plus an aggregate of up to  warrants for a purchase price of  per forward purchase unit or an aggregate purchase price of up to  in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination fund vi holdings will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will result in gross proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business combination and pay related fees and expenses after first applying amounts available to us from the trust account after paying the deferred underwriting discount and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares and any other financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to the consummation of our initial business combination plus any additional amounts mutually agreed by us and fund vi holdings to be retained by the postbusiness combination company for working capital or other purposes these purchases will be required to be made regardless of whether any shares of class a common stock are redeemed by our public stockholders in connection with our initial business combination and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earliest to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination ii the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and iii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our sponsor officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our sponsor or any of our officers directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than we do our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we are an acquisition vehicle of fund vi an energyfocused private investment fund managed by riverstone we have not identified any potential business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any potential business combination target although we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business or industry we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team and the broader riverstone platform to identify acquire and operate a business in the energy industry that may provide opportunities for attractive riskadjusted returns we intend to identify and acquire a business that could benefit from a handson owner with extensive operational experience in the energy sector and that presents potential for an attractive riskadjusted return profile under our stewardship even fundamentally sound companies can often underperform their potential due to a temporary period of dislocation in the markets in which they operate inefficient capital allocation overlevered capital structures excessive cost structures incomplete management teams andor inappropriate business strategies our management team has extensive experience in identifying and executing such fullpotential acquisitions across the upstream midstream refining power services and renewable energy sectors in addition our team has significant handson experience working with private companies in preparing for and executing an initial public offering and serving as active owners and directors by working closely with these companies to continue their transformations and help create value in the public markets we believe that our management team is well positioned to identify attractive riskadjusted returns in the marketplace and that their contacts and transaction sources ranging from industry executives private owners private equity funds and investment bankers in addition to the extensive global industry and geographical reach of the riverstone platform will enable us to pursue a broad range of opportunities our management believes that its ability to identify and implement value creation initiatives will remain central to its differentiated acquisition strategy our management teams objective is to generate attractive returns and create value for our shareholders by applying a disciplined strategy of underwriting intrinsic worth and affecting changes after making an acquisition to unlock value we favor opportunities with certain elements of downside protection for example opportunities where we can hedge proven reserves to reduce commodity risk while improving the riskreward return by driving change and often accelerating the targets growth initiatives our management team has successfully applied this approach at riverstone in both north america and europe and has deployed capital successfully in all market cycles we do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination in november  riverstone formed silver run acquisition corporation silver run i a blank check company formed for substantially the same purposes as our company silver run i aimed to capitalize on the  years of experience in the oil and gas industry of its chief executive officer mark papa prior to silver run i and his time with riverstone mr papa was chairman and chief executive officer of eog resources an exploration and production company through its initial public offering in february  silver run i raised  million from the sale of  million units to public investors with each unit consisting of one share of class a common stock and onethird of one warrant on july   an affiliate of riverstone entered into a definitive agreement to purchase an approximate  interest in centennial resource production llc centennial an independent oil and natural gas company with assets located in the core of the southern delaware basin from funds controlled by and affiliates of ngp energy capital management llc in accordance with the definitive agreement the riverstone affiliate agreed to assign and silver run i agreed to assume its right to purchase the interest in centennial on october   silver run i consummated the acquisition of approximately  of the outstanding membership interests in centennial in connection with the acquisition silver run i raised an additional approximately  billion through a private placement of shares of its class a common stock at  per share upon the closing of the transaction silver run i was renamed centennial resource development inc our sponsor is an investment vehicle of fund vi which is managed by riverstone riverstone has considerable experience investing in the energy industry since the firms founding in  by david leuschen and pierre lapeyre riverstone has committed over  billion to more than  transactions and has raised approximately  billion since its inception across nine private funds and two listed vehicles riverstone has experience investing across a variety of commodity price cycles and a track record of identifying highquality assets businesses and management teams with significant resources capital and optimization potential with respect to the foregoing examples past performance of riverstone including by our management team is not a guarantee either i of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or ii that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination you should not rely on the historical record of riverstones or our managements performance as indicative of our future performance in addition we believe our ability to complete an initial business combination will be enhanced by our having entered into the forward purchase agreement pursuant to which fund vi holdings has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our class a common stock plus an aggregate of up to  warrants for an aggregate purchase price of up to  in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination fund vi holdings will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will

consummation of our initial business combination plus any additional amounts mutually agreed by us and fund vi holdings to be retained by the postbusiness combination company for working capital or
