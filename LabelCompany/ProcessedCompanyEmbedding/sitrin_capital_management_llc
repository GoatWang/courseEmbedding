basis according to the client’s investment objectives financial goals risk tolerance etc we do not manage wrap fee accounts in a different fashion than nonwrap fee accounts as further described in our wrap fee program brochure we receive a portion of the wrap fee for our services   regulatory assets under management   we manage  on a discretionary basis and  on a nondiscretionary basis as of december         item   fees and compensation   how we are compensated for our advisory services   scm’s annual fee is prorated and charged quarterly in advance based upon the market value of the assets being managed by scm on the last day of the previous quarter the maximum annual fee charged by the firm shall not exceed  of the client’s total assets under value but will vary depending on the

management fee based upon certain criteria ie anticipated future earning capacity anticipated future additional assets dollar amount of assets to be managed related accounts account composition preexisting client account retention pro bono activities etc   our firm’s fees are billed on a prorata annualized basis quarterly in advance based upon the market value of the assets being managed by

securities for a commission we would need to have our associated persons registered with a brokerdealer we have chosen not to do so     item   performancebased fees and sidebyside management   scm does not provide any services for performancebased fees performancebased fees are those based on a share of capital gains on or capital appreciation of the assets of a client     item   types of clients and account requirements   we may service the following types of clients individuals high net worth individuals trusts estates or charitable organizations pension and profit sharing plans corporations limited liability companies andor other business types   scm does not have requirements for opening and maintaining accounts     item   methods of analysis investment strategies and risk of loss methods of analysis   scm employs an investment process focused on topdown analysis closely tracking the sp  index the firm first identifies analyzes the current market environment from there scm seeks to identify leading sectors and industries and then seeks out what it believes are the best companies within those industries scm predominantly invests in individual equities and fixed income but may also incorporate etfs for small accounts to provide diversification as part of its evaluation scm’s evaluations of securities may contain aspects of fundamental technical and cyclical analysis   fundamental analysis involves the fundamental financial condition and competitive position of a company scm will analyze the financial condition capabilities of management earnings new products and services as well as the company’s markets and position amongst its competitors in order to determine the recommendations made to clients the primary risk in using fundamental analysis is that while the overall health and position of a company may be good market conditions may negatively impact the security   technical analysis involves the analysis of past market data rather than specific company data in determining the recommendations made to clients technical analysis may involve the use of charts to identify market patterns and trends which may be based on investor sentiment rather than the fundamentals of the company the primary risk in using technical analysis is that spotting historical trends may not help to predict such trends in the future even if the trend will eventually reoccur there is no guarantee that scm will be able to accurately predict such a reoccurrence   cyclical analysis is similar to technical analysis in that it involves the analysis of market conditions at a macro entire marketeconomy or micro company specific level rather than the overall fundamental analysis of the health of the particular company that scm is recommending the risks with cyclical analysis are similar to those of technical analysis   risk of loss   investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear while the stock market may increase and your accounts could enjoy a gain it is also possible that the stock market may decrease and your accounts could suffer a loss  it is important that you understand the risks associated with investing in the stock market are appropriately diversified in your investments and ask us any questions you may have   description of material significant or unusual risks   we generally invest client’s cash balances in money market funds fdic insured certificates of deposit highgrade commercial paper andor government backed debt instruments   ultimately we try to achieve the highest return on our client’s cash balances through relatively lowrisk conservative investments  in most cases at least a partial cash balance will be maintained in a money market account so that our firm may debit advisory fees for our services related to asset management as applicable     item   disciplinary information our firm and management persons have not been involved in any legal or disciplinary events that would be material to the evaluation of the firm or the integrity of its management     item   other financial industry activities and affiliations we have no other financial industry activities and affiliations to disclose     item   code of ethics participation or interest in client transactions and personal trading an investment adviser is considered a fiduciary and our firm has a fiduciary duty to all of our clients as a fiduciary it is an investment adviser’s responsibility to provide fair and full disclosure of all material facts and to act solely in the best interest of each of our clients at all times our fiduciary duty is considered the core underlying principle for our code of ethics which also includes policies and procedures to avoid insider trading as well as personal securities transactions policies and procedures upon employment or affiliation and at least annually thereafter all supervised persons will sign an acknowledgement that they have read understand and agree to comply with our code of ethics   our firm and supervised persons must conduct business in an honest ethical and fair manner and avoid all circumstances that might negatively affect or appear to affect our duty of complete loyalty to all clients  this disclosure is provided to give all clients a summary of our code of ethics  if a client or a potential client wishes to review our code of ethics in its entirety a copy will be provided upon request neither our firm nor a related person recommends to clients or buys or sells for client accounts securities in which our firm or a related person has a material financial interest related persons of our firm may buy or sell securities and other investments that are also owned by our clients in order to minimize this potential conflict of interest our related persons will place client interests ahead of their own interests and adhere to our firm’s code of ethics further our related persons will refrain from buying or selling the same securities prior to buying or selling for our clients in the same day if related persons’ accounts are included in a block trade our related persons’ accounts will be traded in the same manner every time   item   brokerage practices selection of brokerdealers   our firm generally recommends that clients establish brokerage accounts with schwab to maintain custody of their assets and to effect trades for their accounts  schwab may provide us with access to their institutional custody and trading services which are typically not available to schwab retail investors  schwab’s services may also include research and access to mutual funds and other investments that are otherwise generally available only to institutional investors or would require a significantly higher minimum initial investment please note however that our firm is independently owned and operated and not affiliated with schwab and we may recommend that clients establish accounts with firms other than schwab   for client accounts maintained in their custody schwab does not charge separately for trading but is compensated by our firm out of the advisory fees that we charge our firm places trades for clients’ accounts subject to its duty to seek best execution and its other fiduciary duties  while our firm may use brokerdealers other than schwab to execute trades for client accounts maintained at schwab this practice may result in additional costs to clients so that we are more likely to place trades through schwab rather than other brokerdealers  schwab’s execution quality may be different than other brokerdealers neither our firm nor any of its principals andor employees receives any portion of the brokerage commissions andor transaction fees directly charged by a brokerdealer to our firm or charged to client by a brokerdealer which are then absorbed by our firm and credited back to client   research and other benefits our firm may have arrangements with schwab which provide us with their “platform” services schwab’s services include among others brokerage custodial administrative support record keeping and related services that are intended to support our firm in conducting business and in serving the best interests of our clients schwab also makes certain research and brokerage services available at no additional cost to our firm these nonsoftdollar services include certain research and brokerage services including research services obtained by schwab directly from independent research companies as selected by our firm within specific parameters research products and services provided by schwab to our firm may include research reports on recommendations or other information about particular companies or industries economic surveys data and analyses financial publications portfolio evaluation services financial database software and services computerized news and pricing services quotation equipment for use in running software used in investment decisionmaking and other products or services that provide lawful and appropriate assistance by schwab to our firm in the performance of our investment decisionmaking responsibilities the aforementioned research and brokerage services are used by our firm to manage accounts for which we have investment discretion without this arrangement our firm might be compelled to purchase the same or similar services at our own expense   we may also gain access to nonsoftdollar products and services that will help us in managing and administering client accounts  these include software and other technology that provide access to client account data ie trade confirmations and account statements facilitate trade executions provide research pricing information and other market data facilitate in the payment of our firm’s fees from its clients’ accounts and assist with backoffice functions recordkeeping and client reporting many of these services may be used to service all or a substantial number of our accounts as a result of receiving the services for no additional cost we may have an incentive to continue to use or expand the use of schwab’s services our firm examined this potential conflict of interest when we chose to enter into the relationship with schwab and we have determined that the relationship is in the best interest of our firm’s clients and satisfies our client obligations including our duty to seek best execution schwab charges brokerage commissions and transaction fees for effecting certain securities transactions ie transaction fees are charged for certain noload mutual funds commissions are charged for individual equity and debt securities transactions in some instances schwab does charge transaction fees to clients in which case our firm will reimburse the client those fees schwab enables us to obtain many noload mutual funds without transaction charges and other noload funds at nominal transaction charges schwab’s commission rates are generally discounted from customary retail commission rates however the commission and transaction fees charged by schwab may be higher or lower than those charged by other custodians and brokerdealers the investment research products and services that may be obtained by our firm will generally be used to service all of our clients brokerage for client referrals our firm does not receive brokerage for client referrals directed brokerage our firm generally does not permit clients to direct that we execute transactions through a specified brokerdealer we may recommend clients execute through schwab but we do not have discretion over the direction of brokerage special considerations for erisa clients a retirement or erisa plan client may direct all or part of portfolio transactions for its account through a specific broker or dealer in order to obtain goods or services on behalf of the plan  such direction is permitted provided that the goods and services provided are reasonable expenses of the plan incurred in the ordinary course of its business for which it otherwise would be obligated and empowered to pay erisa prohibits directed brokerage arrangements when the goods or services purchased are not for the exclusive benefit of the plan consequently we will request that plan sponsors who direct plan brokerage provide us with a letter documenting that this arrangement will be for the exclusive benefit of the plan aggregation of purchasessales   our firm does not aggregate the purchase or sale of securities for various client accounts in quantities sufficient to obtain reduced transaction costs schwab charges the same transaction fees for the purchase and sale of widely traded securities in block and nonblock procedures long term client accounts are traded differently for a variety of reasons including tax circumstances and investment objectives   item   review of accounts or financial plans   for those clients to whom scm provides investment management services scm monitors those portfolios as part of an ongoing process while regular account reviews are conducted on at least a quarterly basis for those clients to whom scm provides financial planning andor consulting services reviews are conducted on an “as needed” basis such reviews are conducted by one of scm’s investment adviser representatives all investment advisory clients are encouraged to discuss their needs goals and objectives with scm and to keep scm informed of any changes thereto scm contacts ongoing investment advisory clients at least annually to review its previous services andor recommendations and to discuss the impact resulting from any changes in the client’s financial situation andor investment objectives   unless otherwise agreed upon clients are provided with transaction confirmation notices and regular summary account statements directly from the brokerdealer or custodian for the client accounts those clients to whom scm provides investment advisory services will also receive a report from scm that may include such relevant account andor marketrelated information such as an inventory of account holdings and account performance as clients may periodically request clients should compare the account statements they receive from their custodian with those they receive from scm   item   client referrals and other compensation economic benefits from others schwab has provided a loan to our firm the “advisor” to assist our business operations and the loan is guaranteed by marcus j sitrin principal of the advisor the terms of the loan require that management fees to the advisor be paid to an account at schwab for deduction of interest and principal payments on the loan before we may access such management fees   the loan agreement contains various representations and covenants by the advisor including among others that the advisor will maintain at least  million in end client net assets held at schwab “assets under management at schwab” and that the advisor will comply with all applicable laws regulations and agreements and obtain all necessary licenses consents and permits upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the loan agreement schwab may terminate andor accelerate the loan which may have a material adverse effect on the advisor’s ability to perform services for you   some of the products services and other benefits provided by schwab including the loan noted above benefit the advisor and may not benefit the advisor’s client accounts the advisor’s recommendation or requirement that a client place assets in schwab’s custody may be based in part on benefits schwab provides to the advisor or the advisor’s agreement to maintain certain assets under management at schwab and not solely on the nature cost or quality of custody and execution services provided by schwab   advisor places trades for its clients’ accounts subject to its duty to seek best execution and its other fiduciary duties advisor may use brokerdealers other than schwab to execute trades for client accounts maintained at schwab but this practice may result in additional costs to clients so that the advisor is more likely to place trades through schwab rather than other brokerdealers schwab’s execution quality may be different than other brokerdealers   compensation to others we may pay referral fees noncommission based to independent solicitors nonregistered representatives for the referral of their clients to our firm in accordance with rule   of the investment advisers act of  such referral fee represents a share of our investment advisory fee charged to our clients  this arrangement will not result in higher costs to you in this regard we maintain solicitors agreements in compliance with rule   of the investment advisers act of  and applicable state and federal laws all clients referred by solicitors to our firm will be given full written disclosure describing the terms and fee arrangements between our firm and solicitors in cases where state law requires licensure of solicitors we ensure that no solicitation fees are paid unless the solicitor is registered as an investment adviser representative of our firm if we are paying solicitation fees to another registered investment adviser the licensure of individuals is the other firm’s responsibility     item   custody all of our clients receive at least quarterly account statements directly from their custodians  upon opening an account with a qualified custodian on a client’s behalf we promptly notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian’s contact information if we decide to also send account statements to clients such notice and account statements include a legend that recommends that the client compare the account statements received from the qualified custodian with those received from our firm we encourage our clients to raise any questions with us about the custody safety or security of their assets the custodians we do business with will send you independent account statements listing your account balances transaction history and any fee debits or other fees taken out of your account   item   investment discretion scm is given the authority to exercise discretion on behalf of clients scm is considered to exercise investment discretion over a client’s account if it can effect transactions for the client without first having to seek the client’s consent scm is given this authority through a powerofattorney included in the agreement between scm and the client clients may request a limitation on this authority such as certain securities not to be bought or sold scm takes discretion over the following

it is designed to assist clients in meeting their financial goals through the use of financial investments  we conduct at least one but sometimes more than one meeting in person if possible otherwise

the proposed investment plan we work with the client to establish or transfer investment accounts so that we can manage the client’s portfolio once the relevant accounts are under our management we review such accounts on a regular basis and at least quarterly we may periodically rebalance or adjust client accounts under our management if the client experiences any significant changes to hisher financial or personal circumstances the client must notify us so that we can consider such information in managing the client’s investments fee schedule investment management services are offered through the program on a fee basis meaning that clients pay a single annualized fee based upon assets under management scm provides investment management services for an annual fee based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets in the program the annual fee is prorated and charged quarterly in advance based upon the market value of the assets being managed by scm on the last day of the previous quarter  the annual fee varies depending on the market value of the assets in the program and the type of investment management services to be rendered but generally range up to  if assets are deposited into or withdrawn from an account after the inception of a billing period the fee payable with respect to such assets is not adjusted or prorated to account for the change in portfolio value  for the initial term of the program the fee is calculated on a pro rata basis  in the event the agreement is terminated the fee for the final quarter is prorated through the effective date of the termination and the remaining balance is refunded to the client as appropriate relative cost of the program a wrap fee program allows our clients to pay a specified fee for investment advisory services and the execution of transactions the advisory services may include portfolio management andor advice concerning selection of other advisers and the fee is not based directly upon transactions in your account your fee is bundled with our costs for executing transactions in your accounts this results in a higher advisory fee to you we do not charge our clients higher advisory fees based on their trading activity but you should be aware that we may have an incentive to limit our trading activities in your accounts because we are charged for executed trades by participating in a wrap fee program you may end up paying more or less than you would through a nonwrap fee program where a lower advisory fee is charged but trade execution costs are passed directly through to you by the executing broker other types of fees  expenses you may pay custodial fees charges imposed directly by a mutual fund index fund or exchange traded fund which shall be disclosed in the fund’s prospectus ie fund management fees and other fund expenses markups and markdowns spreads paid to market makers wire transfer fees and other fees and taxes on brokerage accounts and securities transactions these fees are not included within the wrapfee you are charged by our firm our investment advisory representatives receive a portion of the advisory fee that you pay us either directly as a percentage of your overall fee or as their salary from our firm in cases where our investment advisory representatives are paid a percentage of your overall advisory fee this may create an incentive to recommend that you participate in a wrap fee program rather than a nonwrap fee program where you would pay for trade execution costs or brokerage account where commissions are charged this is because in some cases we may stand to earn more compensation from advisory fees paid to us through a wrap fee program arrangement if your account is not actively traded item  fees and compensation scm does not impose a stated minimum fee or minimum portfolio value for participation in our wrap fee program   types of clients we typically manage wrap fee accounts on behalf of include individuals and high networth individuals trusts estates or charitable organizations pension and profit sharing plans corporations limited liability companies andor other business types   item  portfolio manager selection and evaluation portfolio management   our firm does not utilize outside portfolio managers  all accounts are managed by our inhouse professionals this may create a conflict of interest in that other investment advisory firms may charge the same or lower fees than our firm for similar services   our related person portfolio managers are not subject to the same selection and review as outside portfolio managers that participate in the wrap fee program  this is because we have chosen not to utilize outside portfolio managers         advisory business   for accounts managed through the program scm primarily allocates assets among individual debt and equity securities but may also incorporate exchangetraded funds etfs for certain accounts scm also provides advice about any type of investment held in clients’ portfolios  the firm also provides advice about any type of legacy position or investment otherwise held in its clients’ portfolios   scm tailors its advisory services to accommodate the needs of its individual clients and continuously seeks to  ensure  that  its  clients’  portfolios  are   managed  in  a  manner  consistent  with  their  specific investment profiles  clients are advised to promptly notify scm if there are changes in their financial situation or if they wish to place any limitations on the management of their portfolios   clients may impose reasonable restrictions or mandates on the management of their accounts if scm determines in its sole discretion the conditions will not materially impact the performance of a portfolio strategy or prove overly burdensome to the firm’s management efforts   our wrap fee and nonwrap fee accounts are managed on an individualized basis according to the client’s investment objectives financial goals and risk tolerance we do not manage wrap fee accounts in a different fashion than nonwrap fee accounts   performancebased fees and sidebyside management   we do not charge performance fees to our clients   methods of analysis investment strategies and risk of loss   scm employs an investment process focused on topdown analysis closely tracking the sp  index the firm first identifies analyzes the current market environment from there scm seeks to identify leading sectors and industries and then seeks out what it believes are the best companies within those industries scm predominantly invests in individual equities and fixed income but may also incorporate etfs for small accounts to provide diversification   as part of its evaluation scm’s evaluations of securities may contain aspects of fundamental technical and cyclical analysis   fundamental analysis involves the fundamental financial condition and competitive position of a company scm will analyze the financial condition capabilities of management earnings new products and services as well as the company’s markets and position amongst its competitors in order to determine the recommendations made to clients the primary risk in using fundamental analysis is that while the overall health and position of a company may be good market conditions may negatively impact the security   technical analysis involves the analysis of past market data rather than specific company data in determining the recommendations made to clients technical analysis may involve the use of charts to identify market patterns and trends which may be based on investor sentiment rather than the fundamentals of the company the primary risk in using technical analysis is that spotting historical trends may not help to predict such trends in the future even if the trend will eventually reoccur there is no guarantee that scm will be able to accurately predict such a reoccurrence   cyclical analysis is similar to technical analysis in that it involves the analysis of market conditions at a macro entire marketeconomy or micro company specific level rather than the overall fundamental analysis of the health of the particular company that scm is recommending the risks with cyclical analysis are similar to those of technical analysis   investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear while the stock market may increase and your accounts could enjoy a gain it is also possible that the stock market may decrease and your accounts could suffer a loss  it is important that you understand the risks associated with investing in the stock market are appropriately diversified in your investments and ask us any questions you may have   voting client securities   our
