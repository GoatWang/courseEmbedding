commercial card liability structure and billing arrangements commercial card accounts provide two primary liability options though a particular company may use both liability options to meet various needs under the combined liability program the individual cardmember and the company are both responsible for business charges with the company either obligated to reimburse the cardmember for business charges  or responsible for directly paying them to trs cardmembers who i incur personal charges ii never file for reimbursement or iii do not repay reimbursed business charges are generally solely liable for payment in contrast under the central bill liability program the company is solely responsible for charges trs offers various billing programs for the commercial cards under the individual billing program each cardmember receives a monthly billing statement detailing his or her charges during the previous period the company can choose from  billing cycles to coordinate billing dates with its payroll periods or reimbursement schedules payment options within the individual billing program include i individual payment whereby each cardmember receives reimbursement from his or her employer for all legitimate business charges and that cardmember then remits payments for all charges directly to trs and ii company payment whereby each cardmember submits an expense report to his or her employer and the company issues a single check to trs for all legitimate business charges while the cardmember directly pays trs for all business charges not reimbursed by his or her employer and for all personal charges under the central billing program monthly billing statements are sent to a central address at the company and the company is solely responsible for all charges underwriting and authorization procedures commercial charge accounts are underwritten at both the company and the individual cardmember level at the company level trs evaluates the company using proprietary scoring models audited financial statements and other public information third party checks bank references verification of application information and commercial credit bureau information to determine which commercial cards will be made available to the company and the appropriate liability structure once a company has been approved for a commercial card relationship individual employees are required to submit applications for commercial cards and undergo a risk assessment based on their application information and personal credit history in some cases an individual employee may not be approved for a commercial card on the basis of his or her personal credit history in other cases an individual employee may be approved for a commercial card only if his or her employer guarantees the payment of charges incurred on that account or if a spending limit is applied to that account in addition to the credit review performed in connection with origination of accounts utilization of the accounts is subject to authorization at the time of such utilization based upon the accountholders past spending and payment activity and credit history certain utilizations such as purchases indicating outofpattern spending initial utilizations on new accounts charges to delinquent accounts and accounts that trs determines to have a higher credit risk are

any terms or conditions of the account including increasing or decreasing fees the ability of trs to make such changes is subject to the requirements of applicable laws and to  certain limitations in the securitization agreements and the receivables purchase agreements pursuant to account agreements accountholders are charged an annual membership fee of    per commercial card depending on the

case chargeoffs may be made earlier in some circumstances the credit evaluation servicing charge off and collection practices of trs may change over time in accordance with its business judgment and applicable law  distinctions between charge accounts and revolving credit plan products there are important distinctions between charge accounts and revolving credit plan products charge accounts generally have no preset spending limit and are designed for use as a convenient method of payment for the purchase of merchandise and services accounts generally cannot be used as a means of financing such purchases accordingly the full balance of a months purchases is billed to accountholders and generally is due upon receipt of the billing statement by contrast revolving credit plans allow customers to make a minimum monthly payment and to borrow the remaining outstanding balance from the credit issuer up to a predetermined limit as a result of these payment requirement differences the accounts have a high monthly payment rate and balances which turn over rapidly relative to their charge volume when compared to revolving credit plan products another distinction between charge accounts and revolving credit plan products is that account balances generally are not subject to monthly finance charges as described above the full account balance is billed monthly and is due upon receipt of the billing statement accountholders do not have the option of using their accounts to extend payment and to pay a finance charge on the remaining outstanding balance revolving credit plan products by contrast do allow customers to pay a specified minimum portion of an outstanding amount and to finance the balance at a finance charge rate determined by the credit issuer because account balances generally are not subject to monthly finance charge assessments in order to provide yield to the issuance trust with respect to the receivables pursuant to the transfer and servicing agreement a portion of the receivables in the accounts included in the issuing entitys portfolio are treated as finance charge receivables and collections received with respect to such receivables are treated as finance charge collections the remainder of such receivables are treated as principal receivables and collections received with respect to such receivables are treated as principal collections see sources of funds to pay the notesdiscount option in this prospectus the notes the following discussion and the discussions under sources of funds to pay the notes and the

noteholders each with respect to principal for that series class or tranche for a series class or tranche of discount notes the outstanding dollar principal amount is an amount stated in or determined by a formula described in the related prospectus supplement the outstanding dollar principal amount of a series class or tranche of discount notes will increase over time as principal accretes on that series class or tranche of notes the outstanding dollar principal amount of any series class or tranche of notes will decrease as a result of each payment of principal of that series class or tranche of notes and will increase as a result of any issuance of additional notes of that series class or tranche adjusted outstanding dollar principal amount the adjusted outstanding dollar principal amount of a series class or tranche of notes is the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series class or tranche less any funds on deposit in the principal funding account for that series class or

series of notes is equal to the sum of the nominal liquidation amounts of all classes or tranches of notes of that series within a series subordinated notes bear the risk before senior notes of a reduction in the nominal liquidation amount of that series due to chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series or due to reallocated principal collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes may be reduced as follows o if finance charge collections allocable to a series of notes are insufficient to fund the default amount allocable to that series the uncovered default amount will result in a reduction in the nominal liquidation amount of that series for a multiple tranche series while these reductions will be allocated initially pro rata to each tranche of notes based on its nominal liquidation amount regardless of class they will then be reallocated to the subordinated notes of that series in succession based  on class designation however these reallocations will be made from tranches of senior notes to tranches of subordinated notes only to the extent that such tranches of senior notes have not used all of their required subordinated amount for any tranche the required subordinated amount will be specified in the related prospectus supplement reductions that cannot be reallocated to a tranche of more subordinate notes will reduce the nominal liquidation amount of the tranche to which the reductions were initially allocated o if principal collections allocable to subordinated notes of a series of notes are reallocated to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement the nominal liquidation amount of that series will be reduced by the amount of the reallocations the amount of principal collections which may be reallocated may be limited for a given series class or tranche of notes such limitations will be specified in the related prospectus supplement in addition for a multiple tranche series principal collections allocable to subordinated notes will be reallocated only to the extent that senior notes have not used all of their required subordinated amount for a multiple tranche series these reductions will be allocated to each tranche of a class pro rata based on its nominal liquidation amount o the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes will be reduced by the

maturity date of a series class or tranche of notes the nominal liquidation amount of such series class or tranche of notes will be reduced to zero see sources of funds to pay the notessale of assets in this prospectus the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes can be increased as follows o for a series class or tranche of discount notes the nominal liquidation amount of that series class or tranche will increase over time as principal accretes to the extent that finance charge collections allocated to the related series of notes are allocated for that purpose o for all series of notes the nominal liquidation amount of that series will increase if finance charge collections allocable to that series are available to reimburse earlier reductions in the nominal liquidation amount of that series due to chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series or due to reallocated principal collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement within each series of notes the increases will be allocated first to the seniormost notes with a deficiency in  their nominal liquidation amounts and then in succession to the subordinated notes with a deficiency in their nominal liquidation amounts o for all series classes or tranches of notes the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes will increase by an amount equal to the principal amount of any additional notes of that series class or tranche issued after the initial issuance of that series class or tranche of notes or if amounts on deposit in the principal funding account for that series class or tranche are deposited into the principal funding account for another series class or tranche of notes or paid to the issuing entity for a multiple tranche series any increase in the nominal liquidation amount will be allocated to each tranche of a class pro rata based on the deficiency in the nominal liquidation amount of that tranche finance charge collections allocated to a series of notes for each monthly period will be applied as described in the related prospectus supplement to cover the default amount allocated to that series if finance charge collections allocated to that series are sufficient to cover the default amount allocated to that series the nominal liquidation amount of that series of notes will not be reduced finance charge collections allocated to a series of notes also will be applied as described in the related prospectus supplement to reimburse earlier reductions in the nominal liquidation amount of that series of notes due to chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series of notes or due to reallocated principal collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement in most circumstances the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes together with any accumulated principal collections held in the related principal funding account will be equal to the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series class or tranche of notes however if there are reductions in the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche due to chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series class or tranche or due to reallocated principal collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement there will be a deficit in the nominal liquidation amount of that series class or tranche unless that deficit is reimbursed through the application of finance charge collections allocated to the applicable series the stated principal amount of that series class or tranche of notes will not be paid in full this will occur either because the amount of dollars allocated to pay them is less than the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series class or tranche or because the amount of dollars allocated to pay the counterparty to a derivative agreement is less than the amount necessary to obtain enough of the applicable foreign currency for payment of the notes in full the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes may not be reduced below zero and may not be increased above the adjusted outstanding dollar principal amount of that series class or tranche the cumulative amount of reductions in the nominal liquidation amount of any series class or tranche of notes due to chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series class or tranche of notes or due to reallocated principal collections  used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement will be limited as described in the related prospectus supplement allocations of chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to a series class or tranche or due to reallocated principal collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement will reduce the nominal liquidation amount of outstanding series classes and tranches of notes only and will not affect series classes or tranches of notes that are issued after that time upon a sale of assets in the issuance trust following i an event of default and acceleration of a series class or tranche of notes or ii the legal maturity date of a series class or tranche of notes as described in the related prospectus supplement and in sources of funds to pay the notessale of assets in this prospectus the nominal liquidation amount of that series class or tranche of notes will be reduced to zero even if the proceeds of that sale amounts on deposit in the issuing entity accounts for that series class or tranche and any other amounts available to such noteholders are not enough to pay all remaining amounts due on those notes after such sale principal collections and finance charge collections will no longer be allocated to that series class or tranche of notes interest interest will accrue on a series class or tranche of notes except on a series class or tranche of discount notes from the relevant issuance date at the applicable interest rate for that series class or tranche which may be a fixed floating or other type of rate as specified in the related prospectus supplement interest on a series class or tranche of notes will be due and payable on the dates specified in the related prospectus supplement each referred to in this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement as an interest payment date or a payment date if the interest payment dates for any notes occur less frequently than monthly interest will be deposited in an interest funding account pending distribution each interest funding account will be established under the indenture supplement for the related series for series with one or more classes andor tranches of notes each class or tranche may have a separate interest funding account interest deposits or payments will be funded from finance charge collections allocated to that series class or tranche of notes during the preceding monthly period or monthly periods from any applicable credit enhancement if necessary and from certain other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement for each issuance of a series class or tranche of fixed rate notes the fixed rate of interest at which interest will accrue for that series class or tranche will be specified in the related prospectus supplement for each issuance of a series class or tranche of floating rate notes the interest rate index or other formula on which the interest payment is based will be specified in the related prospectus supplement in addition the related prospectus supplement will specify if any series class or tranche of notes receives any additional interest and how it is to be calculated a series class or tranche of discount notes will be issued at a price lower than the stated principal amount payable on the expected final payment date of that series class or tranche of notes until the expected final payment date for a series class or tranche of discount notes accreted principal will be capitalized as part of the principal of that series class or tranche of notes and reinvested in the assets of the issuance trust so long as an early amortization event  with respect to that series class or tranche has not occurred if applicable the related prospectus supplement will specify the interest rate to be borne by a series class or tranche of discount notes following an early amortization event or event of default or after its expected final payment date each payment of interest on a series class or tranche of notes will include all interest accrued from the preceding interest payment dateor for the first interest period from the issuance datethrough the day preceding the current interest payment date or any other period as may be specified in the related prospectus supplement if interest on a series class or tranche of notes is not paid within  days after such interest is due and payable an event of default will occur with respect to that series class or tranche of notes see the indentureevents of default in this prospectus principal the timing of payment of principal of a series class or tranche of notes will be specified in the related prospectus supplement each date on which payment of principal is made is referred to in this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement as a payment date certain series classes and tranches of notes are anticipated to have principal paid on one date referred to as the expected final payment date principal of a series class or tranche of notes may be paid later than its expected final payment date if sufficient funds are not allocated and available additionally in the case of a tranche of subordinated notes of a multiple tranche series principal of that tranche will be paid on its expected final payment date only to the extent that payment is permitted by the subordination provisions of the senior notes of that series it is not an event of default if the stated principal amount of a series class or tranche of notes is not paid on its expected final payment date however if the stated principal amount of a series class or tranche of notes is not paid in full on its expected final payment date an early amortization event with respect to that series class or tranche will occur see the indentureearly amortization events in this prospectus if the stated principal amount of a series class or tranche of notes is not paid in full by its legal maturity date an event of default will occur with respect to that series class or tranche of notes see the indentureevents of default in this

class or tranche of notes subordination of interest and principal interest and principal payments on subordinated notes of a series will be subordinated as described in the related prospectus supplement  finance charge collections allocated to a series of notes will be used to pay interest due on senior notes of that series before being available to pay interest due on subordinated notes of that series within a series subordinated notes bear the risk before senior notes of a reduction in the nominal liquidation amount of that series due to chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series or due to reallocated principal collections used to pay shortfalls in interest on senior notes and any other amounts specified in the related prospectus supplement for a multiple tranche series chargeoffs resulting from any uncovered default amount allocated to that series will initially be allocated to each tranche of that series pro rata based on the nominal liquidation amount of that tranche and then reallocated from the tranches of senior notes of that series to the tranches of subordinated notes of that series reducing the nominal liquidation amount of such tranches of subordinated notes to the extent credit enhancement in the form of subordination is still available to the tranches of senior notes see the notesstated principal amount outstanding dollar principal amount adjusted outstanding dollar principal amount and nominal liquidation amountnominal liquidation amount in this prospectus in addition principal collections allocated to a series of notes after giving effect to any reallocations will first be used to fund targeted deposits into the principal funding accounts of senior notes of that series before being applied to the principal funding accounts of subordinated notes of that series required subordinated amount the required subordinated amount for a class or tranche of senior notes is the amount of subordinated notes that is required to be outstanding and available to provide subordination for that class or tranche of senior notes on the date when that class or tranche of senior notes is issued this amount or a calculation that determines this amount will be specified in the related prospectus supplement no class or tranche of notes of a series may be issued unless the required subordinated amount for that class or tranche of notes is available at the time of its issuance as described in the related prospectus supplement for multiple tranche series the required subordinated amount also is used in conjunction with the consumption of enhancement called usage to determine the remaining available subordinated amount for a tranche of senior notes and whether a tranche of subordinated notes of a multiple tranche series may be repaid before its legal maturity date while senior notes of that series are outstanding groups a series of notes may be included in one or more groups of

reallocation group if a series of notes is identified in the related prospectus supplement as included in a reallocation group finance charge collections which would otherwise be allocated to each series based on the floating allocation percentage of that series will instead be combined and will be available for specified required payments for all series in the same reallocation group any issuance of a new series in a reallocation group may reduce or increase the amount of  finance charge collections allocated to any other series of notes in that group see risk factorsissuance of additional notes or master trust investor certificates may affect your voting rights and the timing and amount of payments to you in this prospectus the related prospectus supplement will specify whether your series will be included in a reallocation group and whether any previously issued series have been included in that group while any series of notes may be included in a reallocation group there can be no assurance that any other series will be included in the same group shared excess available finance charge collections group if a series of notes is identified in the related prospectus supplement as included in a shared excess available finance charge collections group finance charge collections for any monthly period allocated to that series in excess of the amount needed to make all required deposits and payments for that series will be applied to cover shortfalls in amounts payable from finance charge collections allocated to other series of notes in that shared excess available finance charge collections group if these shortfalls exceed the total amount of excess finance charge collections available from all series in the same shared excess available finance charge collections group referred to as shared excess available finance charge collections for any monthly period shared excess available finance charge collections will be allocated pro rata among the applicable series of notes in that shared excess available finance charge collections group based on the relative amounts of those shortfalls to the extent shared excess available finance charge collections exceed shortfalls the balance will be paid to the holder of the transferor interest the sharing of shared excess available finance charge collections will be discontinued if the issuing entity delivers to the indenture trustee a certificate to the effect that the continued sharing of shared excess available finance charge collections would have adverse regulatory implications for any account owner or the transferor following the delivery by the issuing entity of any such certificate to the indenture trustee there will be no further sharing of shared excess available finance charge collections while any series of notes may be included in a shared excess available finance charge collections group there can be no assurance that any other series will be included in such group there will be any shared excess available finance charge collections for such group for any monthly period or the issuing entity will not at any time deliver the certificate discontinuing sharing described above while the issuing entity does not believe that based on the applicable rules and regulations as currently in effect the sharing of shared excess available finance charge collections will have an adverse regulatory implication for any account owner or the transferor there can be no assurance that this will continue to be true in the future  shared excess available principal collections group if a series of notes is identified in the related prospectus supplement as being in a shared excess available principal collections group principal collections for any monthly period allocated to that series in excess of the amount needed to make all required deposits and payments for that series will be applied to cover shortfalls in principal deposits or payments payable from principal collections allocated to other series of notes in that shared excess available principal collections group if these shortfalls exceed the total amount of excess principal collections available from all series in the same shared excess available principal collections group referred to as shared excess available principal collections for any monthly period shared excess available principal collections will be allocated pro rata among the applicable series of notes in that shared excess available principal collections group based on the relative amounts of those shortfalls to the extent that shared excess available principal collections exceed principal shortfalls the balance will be paid to the holder of the transferor interest provided that o such shared excess available principal collections will be distributed to the holder of the transferor interest only to the extent that the available overconcentration account amount is equal to or greater than the required overconcentration account amount the transferor amount is equal to or greater than the required transferor amount and the pool balance is equal to or greater than the required pool balance and o in certain circumstances described under sources of funds to pay the notesallocations of amounts to the overconcentration account and allocations of amounts on deposit in the overconcentration account and allocations of amounts to the excess funding account and allocations of amounts on deposit in the excess funding account such shared excess available principal collections will be deposited into the overconcentration account or the excess funding account while any series of notes may be included in the same shared excess available principal collections group there can be no assurance that any other series will be included in such group or that there will be any shared excess available principal collections for such group for any monthly period if principal collections allocated to a series are shared with another series the nominal liquidation amount for the series from which principal collections were shared will not be reduced redemption and early amortization of notes optional redemption the issuing entity or the transferor if the transferor is an affiliate of the servicer may at its option redeem any series class or tranche of notes before its expected final payment date in whole but not in part at any time when the outstanding dollar principal amount of that series class or tranche is less than   or any other percentage that is specified by the transferor  of the highest outstanding dollar principal amount at any time of that series class or tranche this redemption option is referred to as a cleanup call the issuing entity will not redeem subordinated notes if those notes are required to provide credit enhancement for classes of senior notes  if the issuing entity redeems notes it will notify the registered holders of those notes at least  days prior to the redemption date the redemption price of a note will equal  of the outstanding dollar principal amount plus accrued past due and additional interest on those notes to but excluding the date of redemption if the issuing entity is unable to pay the redemption price in full on the redemption date monthly payments on those notes will thereafter be made until the earlier to occur until either the principal of and accrued interest on those notes are paid in full or the legal maturity date occurs whichever is earlier any funds in the collection account allocable to those notes the related principal funding account and if applicable any related class c reserve account will be applied to make the principal and interest payments on those notes on the redemption date mandatory redemption each series class or tranche of notes will be subject to mandatory redemption on its expected final payment date which generally will be  months before its legal maturity date but which may be a different date specified in the related prospectus supplement in addition if an early amortization event occurs with respect to any series class or tranche of notes the issuing entity will be required to repay each series class or tranche of the affected notes before the expected final payment date of that series class or tranche however if so indicated in the related prospectus supplement for certain such affected series class or tranche of notes with the benefit of a derivative agreement or other type of arrangement subject to certain exceptions such repayment will not occur earlier than the expected final payment date of such series class or tranche of notes following an early amortization event repayment of principal prior to the expected final payment date will be made only to the extent funds are available for repayment after giving effect to all allocations and reallocations and in the case of subordinated notes of a multiple tranche series only to the extent that payment is permitted by the subordination provisions of the senior notes of that series the issuing entity will give notice to holders of the affected series class or tranche of notes of the occurrence of an early amortization event see the indentureearly amortization events in this prospectus for a description of the early amortization events and their consequences to noteholders whenever the issuing entity redeems or repays a series class or tranche of notes it will do so only to the extent that finance charge collections and principal collections  including any amounts received under any derivative agreement any amounts received under any supplemental credit enhancement agreement any amounts received under any supplemental liquidity agreement and any amounts in the issuing entity accounts not included in finance charge collections and principal collections  allocated to that series class or tranche of notes are sufficient to redeem or repay that series class or tranche of notes in full in addition the redemption and repayment will occur only to the extent that the notes to be redeemed or repaid are not required to provide required subordination for senior notes a noteholder will have no claim against the issuing entity if the issuing entity fails to make a required redemption or repayment of a series class or tranche of notes before the legal maturity date because no funds are available for that purpose or because the notes that would otherwise be redeemed or repaid are required to provide subordination for senior notes the failure to  redeem or repay before the legal maturity date under these circumstances will not be an event of default final payment of the notes noteholders of a series class or tranche generally will not receive payment of principal in excess of the stated principal amount of that series class or tranche or in the case of a series class or tranche of foreign currency notes any amount received by the issuing entity under a derivative agreement with respect to principal of that series class or tranche following i an event of default and acceleration or ii the legal maturity date of a series class or tranche of notes assets in the issuance trust will be sold generally in an aggregate amount not to exceed i the nominal liquidation amount of that affected series class or tranche plus ii the product of the nominal liquidation amount of that affected series class or tranche and the discount option percentage subject to any further limitations specified in the related prospectus supplement and for a multiple tranche series only to the extent that payment is permitted by the subordination provisions of the senior notes of the same series the proceeds of that sale and any other amounts available to such noteholders will be applied first to pay the outstanding dollar principal amount of that affected series class or tranche and second to pay any accrued past due and additional interest if any on that affected series class or tranche of notes upon the sale following an event of default and acceleration with respect to any tranche of notes of a multiple tranche series which occurs prior to the legal maturity date of such tranche any sale of assets in the issuance trust with respect to such tranche may be delayed until i the senior notes of the same series are prefunded sufficiently ii enough senior notes are repaid or iii new subordinated notes have been issued in each case to the extent that the tranche of subordinated notes is no longer needed to provide the required subordination for the senior notes of that series in a multiple tranche series if a tranche of notes directs a sale of assets in the issuance trust then after the sale that tranche will no longer be entitled to subordination from subordinated notes of the same series a series class or tranche of notes will be considered to be paid in full the holders of that series class or tranche of notes will have no further right or claim and the issuing entity will have no further obligation or liability for principal or interest on those notes on the earliest to occur of o the date of the payment in full of the

exchange and registration and transfer of notes the notes offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement will be issued in registered form the notes will be represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of the depository trust company as depository or its nominee we refer to each beneficial interest in a global note as a bookentry note for a description of the special provisions that apply to bookentry notes see bookentry notes in this prospectus a holder of notes may exchange those notes for other notes of the same class or tranche of any authorized denominations and of the same aggregate stated principal amount expected final payment date and legal maturity date and of like terms any holder of a note may present that note for registration of transfer with the form of transfer properly executed at the office of the note registrar or at the office of any transfer agent that the issuing entity designates unless otherwise provided in the note to be transferred or exchanged holders of notes will not be charged any service charge for the exchange or transfer of their notes holders of notes that are to be transferred or exchanged will be liable for the payment of any taxes or other governmental charges described in the indenture and any supplement thereto before the transfer or exchange will be completed the note registrar or transfer

may at any time rescind the designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the location through which any transfer agent acts however the issuing entity will be required to maintain a transfer agent in each place of payment for a series class or tranche of notes the related prospectus supplement may state that application will be made to list the related series class or tranche of notes on the luxembourg stock exchange or another exchange bookentry notes the notes offered by this prospectus and the related prospectus supplement will be delivered in bookentry form this means that except under the limited circumstances  described below under definitive notes purchasers of notes will not be entitled to have the notes registered in their names and will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive paper form instead upon issuance all of the notes of a class will be represented by one or more fully registered permanent global notes without interest coupons each global note will be held by a securities depository named the depository trust company and will be registered in the name of its nominee cede  co no global note representing bookentry notes may be transferred except as a whole by dtc to a nominee of dtc or by a nominee of dtc to another nominee of dtc thus dtc or its nominee will be the only registered holder of the notes and will be considered the sole representative of the beneficial owners of notes for purposes of the indenture the registration of the global notes in the name of cede  co will not affect beneficial ownership and is performed merely to facilitate subsequent transfers the bookentry system which is also the system through which most publicly traded common stock is held is used because it eliminates the need for physical movement of securities the laws of some jurisdictions however may require some purchasers to take physical delivery of their notes in definitive form these laws may impair the ability to own or transfer book entry notes purchasers of notes in the united states may hold interests in the global notes through dtc either directly if they are participants in that systemsuch as a bank brokerage house or other institution that maintains securities accounts for customers with dtc or its nomineeor otherwise indirectly through a participant in dtc purchasers of notes in europe may hold interests in the global notes through clearstream luxembourg or through euroclear bank sanv as operator of the euroclear system because dtc will be the only registered owner of the global notes clearstream luxembourg and euroclear will hold positions through their respective us depositories which in turn will hold positions on the books of dtc as long as the notes are in bookentry form they will be evidenced solely by entries on the books of dtc its participants and any indirect participants dtc will maintain records showing o the ownership interests of its participants including the us depositories and o all transfers of ownership interests between its participants the participants and indirect participants in turn will maintain records showing o the ownership interests of their customers including indirect participants that hold the notes through those participants and o all transfers between these persons thus each beneficial owner of a bookentry note will hold its note indirectly through a hierarchy of intermediaries with dtc at the top and the beneficial owners own securities intermediary at the bottom the issuing entity the indenture trustee and their agents will not be liable for the accuracy of and are not responsible for maintaining supervising or reviewing dtcs records or any participants records relating to bookentry notes the issuing entity the indenture trustee and  their agents also will not be responsible or liable for payments made on account of the bookentry notes until definitive notes are issued to the beneficial owners as described below under definitive notes all references to holders of notes means dtc the issuing entity the indenture trustee and any paying agent transfer agent or securities registrar may treat dtc as the absolute owner of the notes for all purposes beneficial owners of bookentry notes should realize that the issuing entity will make all distributions of principal of and interest on their notes to dtc and will send all required reports and notices solely to dtc as long as dtc is the registered holder of the notes dtc and the participants are generally required to receive and transmit all distributions notices and directions from the indenture trustee to the beneficial owners through the chain of intermediaries similarly the indenture trustee will accept notices and directions solely from dtc therefore in order to exercise any rights of a holder of notes under the indenture and any supplement thereto each person owning a beneficial interest in the notes must rely on the procedures of dtc and in some cases clearstream luxembourg or euroclear if the beneficial owner is not a participant in that system then it must rely on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest dtc has advised the issuer that it will take actions under the indenture only at the direction of its participants which in turn will act only at the direction of the beneficial owners some of these actions however may conflict with actions it takes at the direction of other participants and beneficial owners notices and other communications by dtc to participants by participants to indirect participants and by participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them beneficial owners of bookentry notes should also realize that bookentry notes may be more difficult to pledge because of the lack of a physical note a beneficial owner may also experience delays in receiving distributions on his or her notes since distributions will initially be made to dtc and must be transferred through the chain of intermediaries to the beneficial owners account the depository trust company dtc is a limitedpurpose trust company organized under the new york banking law and is a banking institution within the meaning of the new york banking law dtc is also a member of the federal reserve system a clearing corporation within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and a clearing agency registered under section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended dtc was created to hold securities deposited by its participants and to

trust not securing any series class or tranche of notes for any monthly period the transferor amount equals the pool balance as of the close of business on the last day of such monthly period minus the aggregate nominal liquidation amount of all notes as of the close of business on such day the transferor amount fluctuates due to changes in the amount of principal receivables included in the issuance trust the aggregate invested amount of the collateral certificates included in the issuance trust the amount on deposit in the excess funding account and the aggregate nominal liquidation amount of all notes as a result the transferor amount generally increases if there are reductions in the nominal liquidation amount of a series class or tranche of notes due to payments of principal of that series class or tranche of notes or a deposit into the principal funding account with respect to that series class or tranche  or an increase in the pool balance without a corresponding increase in the nominal liquidation amount of any series classes or tranches of notes the transferor amount generally decreases as a result of the issuance of a new series class or tranche of notes

request that trs designate accounts which qualify as eligible accounts to the transferor in turn under each of the centurion receivables purchase agreement and the fsb receivables purchase agreement trs may request that centurion or fsb as applicable designate accounts which qualify as eligible accounts to trs the transferor will designate those accounts to be included in the issuing entitys

be of the same credit quality as the receivables arising in the accounts already included in the issuing entitys portfolio or any existing collateral certificate included in the issuance trust this is because the receivables arising in the accounts included in the portfolio of the master trust or securitization special purpose entity which has issued such additional collateral certificate may not be of the same credit quality as the receivables in any of the accounts included in the issuing entitys portfolio or included in the portfolio of a master trust or other securitization special purpose

receivables are treated as finance charge collections the remainder of such receivables are treated as principal receivables and collections received with respect to those receivables are treated as principal collections the existence of discount option receivables results in an increase in the amount of finance charge receivables and finance charge collections a reduction in the amount of

originator or other transaction parties if applicable in accordance with item  of regulation ab federal income tax consequences general the following summary describes the material united states federal income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of an interest in the notes additional federal income tax considerations relevant to a particular tranche may be set forth in the related prospectus supplement the following summary has been prepared and reviewed by orrick herrington  sutcliffe llp as special tax counsel to the issuing entity special tax counsel the summary is based on the internal revenue code of  as amended as of the date hereof and existing final temporary and proposed treasury regulations revenue  rulings and judicial decisions all of which are subject to prospective and retroactive changes the summary is addressed only to original purchasers of an interest in the notes deals only with interests in notes held as capital assets within the meaning of section  of the internal revenue code and except as specifically set forth below does not address tax consequences of holding interests in notes that may be relevant to investors in light of their own investment circumstances or their special tax situations such as certain financial institutions taxexempt organizations life insurance companies dealers in securities nonus persons or investors holding interests in the notes as part of a conversion transaction as part of a hedge or hedging transaction or as a position in a straddle for tax purposes further this discussion does not address alternative minimum tax consequences or any tax consequences to holders of equity interests in a holder of an interest in a note special tax counsel is of the opinion that the following summary of federal income tax consequences is correct in all material respects an opinion of special tax counsel however is not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and no ruling on any of the issues discussed below will be sought from the internal revenue service moreover there are no authorities on similar transactions involving interests issued by an entity with terms similar to those of the notes described in this prospectus further note owners should be aware that this summary and the opinions contained herein may not be able to be relied upon to avoid any income tax penalties that may be imposed with respect to the notes accordingly it is suggested that persons considering the purchase of an interest in notes should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the united states federal income tax consequences of an investment in an interest in the notes and the application of united states federal income tax laws as well as the laws of any state local or foreign taxing jurisdictions to their particular situations description of opinions as more fully described in this federal income tax consequences section special tax counsel is of the opinion generally to the effect that the issuing entity will not be subject to federal income tax and further that the notes will be characterized as debt for united states federal income tax purposes additionally special tax counsel is of the opinion generally to the effect that the statements set forth in this section to the extent that they constitute matters of law or legal conclusions are correct in all material respects special tax counsel has not been asked to opine on any other federal income tax matter and the balance of this discussion does not purport to set forth any opinion of special tax counsel concerning any other particular federal income tax matter for example the discussion of original issue discount below is a general discussion of federal income tax consequences relating to an investment in notes that are treated as having original issue discount which discussion special tax counsel opines is correct in all material respects as described above however that discussion does not set forth any opinion as to whether any particular tranche or series of notes will be treated as having original issue discount additionally those matters as to which special tax counsel renders opinions should be understood to be subject to the additional considerations in the discussions relating to those opinions set forth below special tax counsel has not been asked to and does not render any opinion regarding the state or local income tax consequences of the purchase ownership and disposition of a beneficial interest in the notes see state and local tax consequences below  this description of the substance of the opinions rendered by special tax counsel is not intended as a substitute for an investors review of the remainder of this discussion of income tax consequences or for consultation with its own advisors or tax return preparer tax characterization of the issuing entity and the notes treatment of the issuing entity as an entity not subject to tax special tax counsel is of the opinion that although no transaction closely comparable to that contemplated herein has been the subject of any treasury regulation revenue ruling or judicial decision each of the issuing entity and to the extent a collateral certificate is included in the issuing entitys assets the related master trust or other securitization special purpose entity will not be classified as an association or as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a result special tax counsel is of the opinion that the issuing entity will not be subject to federal income tax however as discussed above this opinion is not binding on the internal revenue service and no assurance can be given that this characterization will prevail the precise tax characterization of the issuing entity for federal income tax purposes is not certain it might be viewed as merely holding assets on behalf of the transferor as collateral for notes issued by the transferor on the other hand it could be viewed as one or more separate entities for tax purposes issuing the notes this distinction however should not have a significant tax effect on holders of interests in notes except as stated below under possible alternative characterizations treatment of the notes as debt special tax counsel is of the opinion that although no transaction closely comparable to that contemplated herein has been the subject of any treasury regulation revenue ruling or judicial decision the notes will be characterized as debt for united states federal income tax purposes additionally the issuing entity will agree by entering into the indenture and the holders of interests in notes will agree by their purchase and holding of an interest in notes to treat the notes as debt secured by the receivables and other assets of the issuing entity for united states federal income tax purposes possible alternative characterizations if contrary to the opinion of special tax counsel the internal revenue service successfully asserted that a series or class of notes did not represent debt for united states federal income tax purposes those notes might be treated as equity interests in the issuing entity or some other entity for such purposes if so treated investors could be treated either as partners in a partnership or alternatively as shareholders in a taxable corporation for such purposes if an investor were treated as a partner in a partnership it would be taxed individually on its respective share of the partnerships income gain loss deductions and credits attributable to the partnerships ownership of the receivables and other assets and liabilities of the partnership without regard to whether there were actual distributions of that income as a result the amount timing character and source of items of income and deduction of an investor could differ if its interest in notes were held to constitute a partnership interest rather than debt treatment of a holder of an interest in notes as a partner could have adverse tax consequences to certain holders for example absent an applicable exemption income to foreign persons would be subject to united states tax and united states tax return  filing and withholding requirements and individual holders might be subject to certain limitations on their ability to deduct their share of partnership expenses alternatively the internal revenue service could contend that some or all of the notes or separately some of the other securities that the issuing entity is permitted to issue and which are permitted to constitute debt or equity for federal income tax purposes constitute equity in a partnership that should be classified as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes any such partnership would be classified as a publicly traded partnership and could be taxable as a corporation if its equity interests were traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or its substantial equivalent the transferor intends to take measures designed to reduce the risk that the issuing entity could be classified as a publicly traded partnership although the transferor expects that such measures will ultimately be successful certain of the actions that may be necessary for avoiding the treatment of such other securities as readily tradable on a secondary market or its substantial equivalent are not fully within the control of the transferor as a result there can be no assurance that the measures the transferor intends to take will in all circumstances be sufficient to prevent the issuing entity from being classified as a publicly traded partnership if the issuing entity or any relevant master trust were treated in whole or in part as one or more publicly traded partnerships taxable as a corporation corporate tax imposed with respect to such corporation could materially reduce cash available to make payments on the notes and foreign investors could be subject to withholding taxes additionally no distributions from the corporation would be deductible in computing the taxable income of the corporation except to the extent that any notes or other securities were treated as debt of the corporation and distributions to the related holder of an interest in notes or other security holders were treated as payments of interest thereon further distributions to a holder of an interest in notes not treated as holding debt would be dividend income to the extent of the current and accumulated earnings and profits of the corporation possibly without the benefit of any dividends received deduction prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the consequences of possible alternative characterizations to them in their particular circumstances the following discussion assumes that the characterization of the notes as debt and the issuing entity and any relevant master trust as entities not subject to federal income tax is correct consequences to holders of an interest in the offered notes interest and original issue discount stated interest on a note will be includible in gross income as it accrues or is received in accordance with the usual method of tax accounting of a holder of an interest in notes if a class of notes is issued with original issue discount the provisions of sections  through  and  of the internal revenue code will apply to those notes under those provisions a holder of an interest in such a note including a cash basis holder would be required to include the original issue discount on an interest in a note in income for federal income tax purposes on a constant yield basis resulting in the inclusion of original issue discount in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income subject to the discussion below an interest in a note will be treated as having original issue discount to the extent that its stated redemption price exceeds its issue price if such excess equals or exceeds  percent multiplied by the weighted average life of the note determined by taking into account the number of complete years following issuance until payment is made for each partial  principal payment under section a of the internal revenue code special provisions apply to debt instruments on which payments may be accelerated due to prepayments of other obligations securing those debt instruments however no regulations have been issued interpreting those provisions and the manner in which those provisions would apply to the notes is unclear but the application of section a could affect the rate of accrual of original issue discount and could have other consequences to holders of interests in the notes additionally the internal revenue service could take the position based on treasury regulations that none of the interest payable on an interest in a note is unconditionally payable and hence that all of such interest should be included in its stated redemption price at maturity if sustained such treatment should not significantly affect tax liabilities for most holders of the notes but prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the impact to them in their particular circumstances the issuing entity intends to take the position that interest on the notes constitutes qualified stated interest and that the above consequences do not apply market discount a holder of an interest in a note who purchases its interest at a discount that exceeds any original issue discount not previously includible in income may be subject to the market discount rules of sections  through  of the internal revenue code these rules provide in part that gain on the sale or other disposition of a note and partial principal payments on a note are treated as ordinary income to the extent of accrued market discount the market discount rules also provide for deferral of interest deductions with respect to debt incurred to purchase or carry a note that has market discount market premium a holder of an interest in a note who purchases its interest at a premium may elect to amortize the premium against interest income over the remaining term of the note in accordance with the provisions of section  of the internal revenue code disposition of an interest in the notes subject to exceptions such as in the case of wash sales upon the sale exchange or retirement of an interest in a note the holder of such interest will recognize taxable gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the disposition other than amounts attributable to accrued interest and the holders adjusted tax basis in its interest in the note the holders adjusted tax basis in its interest in the note generally will equal the cost of the interest in the note to such holder increased by any market or original issue discount previously included in income by such holder with respect to the note and decreased by the amount of any bond premium previously amortized and any payments of principal or original issue discount previously received by such holder with respect to such note except to the extent of any accrued market discount not previously included in income any such gain treated as capital gain will be longterm capital gain if the interest in the note has been held for more than one year and any such loss will be a capital loss subject to limitations on deductibility  foreign holders under united states federal income tax law now in effect subject to exceptions applicable to certain types of interest payments of interest by the issuer to a holder of an interest in a note who as to the united

a substitute form signed under penalties of perjury certifying that the beneficial owner of the note is a foreign person and providing the foreign persons name address and certain additional information if a note is held through a securities clearing organization or certain other financial institutions the organization or institution may provide the relevant signed statement to the withholding agent in that case however the signed statement must be accompanied by an irs form wben or substitute form provided by the foreign person that owns the interest in the note special rules apply to partnerships estates and trusts and in certain circumstances certifications as to foreign status and other matters may be required to be provided by partners and beneficiaries thereof if such interest is not portfolio interest then it will be subject to united states federal income and withholding tax at a rate of  unless reduced or eliminated pursuant to an applicable tax treaty or such interest is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the united states and in either case the appropriate statement has been provided any capital gain realized on the sale

not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the united states by the foreign person and ii in the case of an individual foreign person such individual is not present in the united states for  days or more in the taxable year the us treasury department has issued final treasury regulations which revise various procedural matters relating to withholding taxes holders of interests in notes should consult their tax advisors regarding the procedures whereby they may establish an exemption from withholding backup withholding and information reporting payments of principal and interest as well as payments of proceeds from the sale retirement or disposition of an interest in a note may be subject to backup withholding tax under section  of the internal revenue code if a recipient of such payments fails to furnish to the payor certain identifying information any amounts deducted and withheld would be allowed as a credit against such recipients united states federal income tax provided appropriate proof is provided under rules established by the internal revenue  service furthermore certain penalties may be imposed by the internal revenue service on a recipient of payments that is required to supply information but that does not do so in the proper manner backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients such as corporations and financial institutions information may also be required to be provided to the internal revenue service concerning payments unless an exemption applies holders of interests in the notes should consult their tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and information reporting and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption the united states federal income tax discussion set forth above may not be applicable depending upon the particular tax situation of a holder of an interest in the notes and does not purport to address the issues described with the degree of specificity that would be provided by a taxpayers own tax advisor accordingly it is suggested that prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences to them of the purchase ownership and disposition of an interest in the notes and the possible effects of changes in federal tax laws state and local tax consequences the discussion above does not address the taxation of the issuing entity or the tax consequences of the purchase ownership or disposition of an interest in the notes under any state or local tax law it is suggested that each investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding state and local tax consequences benefit plan investors benefit plans are required to comply with restrictions under the employee retirement income security act of  known as erisa andor section  of the internal revenue code if they are subject to either or both sets of restrictions the erisa restrictions include rules concerning prudence and diversification of the investment of assets of a benefit planreferred to as plan assets a benefit plan fiduciary should consider whether an investment by the benefit plan in notes complies with these requirements in general a benefit plan for these purposes includes o a plan or arrangement which provides deferred compensation or certain health or other welfare benefits to employees o an employee benefit plan that is taxqualified under the internal revenue code and provides deferred compensation to employeessuch as a pension profitsharing section k or keogh plan and o a collective investment fund or other entity if i the fund or entity has one or more benefit plan investors and ii certain lookthrough rules apply and treat the assets of the fund or entity as constituting plan assets of the benefit plan investor however a plan maintained by a governmental employer is not a benefit plan for these purposes most plans maintained by religious organizations and plans maintained by foreign employers for the benefit of employees employed outside the united states are also not benefit plans for these purposes a fund or other entityincluding an insurance company general  accountconsidering an investment in notes should consult its tax advisors concerning whether its assets might be considered plan assets of benefit plan investors under these rules prohibited transactions erisa and section  of the internal revenue code also prohibit transactions of a specified type between a benefit plan and a party in interest who is related in a specified manner to the benefit plan individual retirement accounts and taxqualified plans that provide deferred compensation to employees are also subject to these prohibited transaction rules unless they are maintained by a governmental employer or in most cases a religious organization violation of these prohibited transaction rules may result in significant penalties there are statutory exemptions from the prohibited transaction rules and the us department of labor has granted administrative exemptions for specified transactions potential prohibited transactions from investment in notes there are two categories of prohibited transactions that might arise from a benefit plans investment in notes fiduciaries of benefit plans contemplating an investment in notes should carefully consider whether the investment would violate these rules prohibited transactions between the benefit plan and a party in interest the first category of prohibited transaction could arise on the grounds that the benefit plan by purchasing notes was engaged in a prohibited transaction with a party in interest a prohibited transaction could arise for example if the notes were viewed as debt of the transferor and the transferor is a party in interest as to the benefit plan a prohibited transaction could also arise if trs the transferor the indenture trustee the servicer or another party with an economic relationship to the issuing entity either o is involved in the investment decision for the benefit plan to purchase notes or o is otherwise a party in interest as to the benefit plan if a prohibited transaction might result from the benefit plans purchase of notes an administrative exemption from the prohibited transaction rules might be available to permit an investment in notes the exemptions that are potentially available include the following prohibited transaction class exemptions o  available to inhouse asset managers o  available to insurance company general accounts o  available to bank collective investment funds o  available to insurance company pooled separate accounts and o  available to qualified professional asset managers however even if the benefit plan is eligible for one of these exemptions the exemption may not cover every aspect of the investment by the benefit plan that might be a prohibited transaction prohibited transactions between the issuing entity and a party in interest the second category of prohibited transactions could arise if  o a benefit plan acquires notes and o under the lookthrough rules of the us department of labor plan asset regulation assets of the issuer are treated as if they were plan assets of the benefit plan in this case every transaction by the issuing entity would be treated as a transaction by the benefit plan using its plan assets if assets of the issuing entity are treated as plan assets of a benefit plan investor a prohibited transaction could result if the issuing entity itself engages in a transaction with a party in interest as to the benefit plan for example if the issuing entitys assets are treated as assets of the benefit plan and the issuing entity holds a credit or charge receivable that is an obligation of a participant in that same benefit plan then there would be a prohibited extension of credit between the benefit plan and a party in interest the plan participant as a result if assets of the issuing entity are treated as plan assets there would be a significant risk of a prohibited transaction moreover the prohibited transaction class exemptions referred to above could not be relied on to exempt all the transactions of the issuing entity from the prohibited transaction rules in addition because all the assets of the issuing entity would be treated as plan assets managers of those assets might be required to comply with the fiduciary responsibility rules of erisa under an exemption in the plan asset regulation assets of the issuing entity would not be considered plan assets and so this risk of prohibited transactions should not arise if a benefit plan purchases a note that o is treated as indebtedness under local law and o has no substantial equity features the issuing entity expects that all notes offered by this prospectus will be indebtedness under local law likewise although there is no authority directly on point the issuing entity believes that the notes should not be considered to have substantial equity features as a result the plan asset regulation should not apply to cause assets of the issuing entity to be treated as plan assets investment by benefit plan investors for the reasons described in the preceding sections and subject to the limitations referred to therein benefit plans can purchase notes however the benefit plan fiduciary must ultimately determine whether the requirements of the plan asset regulation are satisfied more generally the fiduciary must determine whether the benefit plans investment in notes will result in one or more nonexempt prohibited transactions or otherwise violate the provisions of erisa or the internal revenue code tax consequences to benefit plans in general assuming the notes are debt for federal income tax purposes interest income on notes would not be taxable to benefit plans that are tax exempt under the internal revenue code unless the notes were debtfinanced property because of borrowings by the benefit plan itself however if contrary to the opinion of special tax counsel for federal income tax purposes the notes are equity interests in a partnership and the partnership is viewed as having other outstanding debt then all or part of the interest income on the notes would be taxable to  the benefit plan as debtfinanced income benefit plans should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of purchasing notes brokerage partners   edgar online inc all rights reserved  nasdaq edgr  solutions for corporations  terms of use  privacy statement   dorsey v american express
