operating officer thanks mark good morning and thanks for joining us little earlier today than normal i get to our second quarter results in a few minutes but first i want touch on our other news from yesterday as you know last night we announced the nationwide mutual insurance company and nationwide financial services have entered into a definitive arrangement approved by both companys boards of directors the nationwide financial management team and i support this transition the strategic rationale is compelling the terms of the transactions for the public shares are fair and the simplified governance and operating structure will better enable nf to be successful over the longer term under the terms of the agreement nationwide mutual will acquire all of the outstanding publicly held class a shares of common stock of nfs for  per share this represents a  premium over our unaffected share price on march th the last trading day prior to disclosure of the original proposal for nationwide mutual the transaction which is subject to customary closing conditions as well as shareholder and regulatory approvals is expected to close late in the fourth quarter or early  before i go any further i want to acknowledge the hard work of the special committee of the nationwide financial board of directors the special committee undertook a deliberate and rigorous process to evaluate the proposed merger as a result of that rigor despite a very turbulent equity market the special committee negotiated significant premiums to the original proposed price of  it should be noted that nf management appropriately so was not actively involved in the special committees deliberations or negotiations accordingly i am not privy to watch that place and i am not in a position to answer questions today regarding the factors that the committee relied upon in their deliberation regarding value however what i can say is that they have the utmost confidence in special committee members and i believe the process was fair and independent i believe that the special committee in consultation with their independent financial and legal advisors came to a reasonable conclusion that would be fully supported by the fairness opinion beyond that there is not much more that i can add on valuation the specific details about the process and the fairness opinion provided by lazard will be made available in the proxy statement when it is filed looking forward i believe that simplifying our ownership structures is good for our customers business partners and associates while our current structure has served us well over the past decade our ability to grow and meet the needs of our customers over the next decade and beyond will benefit from the simpler and more customer centric business model as you are aware we are on a highly competitive industry and winning over the longer term require successful differentiation in the marketplace as well as scale as we view landscape there are many factors that are changing how financial services products are distributed in particular client firms are becoming more selective in seeking manufacturing partners that can help them achieve broader firm objectives rather than more product centric goals as ive stated on our previous calls it is important that we take a more unified approach to how we think about and manage our mix to better position nf to accelerate topline growth and realize cross business synergies as we began  ive told you that one of my primary areas of focus was better alignment of our business model and organization to more effectively identify and serve customer needs and to that end we have been working diligently to shift away from a siloed product centric organization to one that truly understands consumers client firms and investment professionals while nationwide financial did not solicit the proposal from nationwide mutual combining our two organizations is entirely consistent with and complementary to our existing strategy simplifying our structural health nf better leverage our ability to bring a combination of investment protection and retirement plan solutions and services to our clients through a more unified approach one nationwide one strategy and a more effective organization will allow us be more closely focused on our combined customer needs and deliver even more compelling financial solutions following the closing of this transaction i believe that nationwide will be a stronger company better able to develop and deliver even more compelling solutions for our customers all supported by common executional goals priorities and performance metrics across the entire enterprise at the end of the day this combination will allow us to more effectively function as the strategic partner with client firms by providing what they really need an easier way to meet the complete needs of the end customer on a more personal note my management team and i will continue to lead our financial services businesses i believe that we have one of the strongest management teams in the industry to their leadership and the hard work of nf associates significant progress has been made over the last several years to improve nf performance and outlook and aspect recognized by the mutual in his decision to pursue  ownership of nfs for all the reasons that i have outlined this morning this transaction represents a unique and compelling opportunity and im excited to be part of it let me turn to our second quarter financial results despite a difficult operating environment our core business performance remained fundamentally sound through the first half of the year while market turbulence and the weak economy are pressuring sales and revenue growth in some of our businesses we have generally maintained operating margins and delivered reasonably solid core operating earnings through our focus on quality execution and discipline expense management additionally and very importantly our balance sheet remains strong as our risk management capabilities are proving effective and our diversified investment portfolio is performing as expected given the market environment so turning to the numbers the second quarter net operating earnings were  per diluted share compared to  per diluted share of the second quarter of last year as both periods contained significant unusual items comparisons are some what difficult excluding the significant items from both periods net operating earnings for the quarter were  per diluted share compared to  per diluted share in the prior year our reported return on equity for the quarter was  after adjusting for an unusual items we consider  to be the more normalized return equity for the quarter im very pleased with the dramatic improvement we are seeing in our life business validating the actions we have taken to strengthen this business and enhanced its competitive position second quarter sales are traditional and fixed life products increased  over last year due to the introduction of innovative product solutions extended distribution reach improved sales processes and enhancements of a nationwide financial network that all have been initiated over the last twelve months notably recent market data indicates the nationwide financials overall life insurance market share ratings improved significantly over the last twelve months nf jumped ten spots in the overall life insurance market share rankings and universal life share rankings in our variable annuity business second quarter of va sales were down  sequentially and  versus last year there is little question that market volatility and the softening economy continue to way on both investment professionals and consumers resulting in an increased sense of financial insecurity and indecision with respect to managing financial matters many are sitting on the sidelines as a consequence demand for equitybased products such as variable annuities appears to be weakening across the industry in retirement plans public sector sales were up  versus the prior year quarter driven primarily by increased contributions from several large plants private sector sales were down slightly over the second quarter of last year the weakness in private sector sales is primarily caused by the continued volatility in the capital markets and a weakening economy which has reduced the number of small plan k plan in transition as plans sponsors have been reluctant to make changes in this environment we also saw lower contributions in fewer deferral increases by participants in light of slowing economy despite a tough sales environment we are avoiding the temptation to take actions that might appear to drive an improvement in shortterm results at the expense of longer term objectives we are not interested in what we view as overly aggressive or irrational tactics designed to achieve shortterm sales objectives while i would not go so far as to say that we are currently seeing irrational competitive behavior we are seeing increasing evidence of pricing pressure and aggressive feature wars in some product categories while aggressive competition is healthy we believe it is important that we maintain an appropriate balance between the underlying value of what our products provides to the customer and adequate returns for nf thats said we are not sitting on the sidelines either we are actively looking at ways and enhance our existing product portfolio in the coming months well be launching an array of new or enhanced products designed to bring additional value to consumers while further strengthening our competitive position in conclusion despite a very challenging environment our core business performance remained fundamentally sound to the first half of the year as we move forward i believe its signifying our owning structure by combing with nationwide mutual is a great opportunity that will benefit our customer our business partners and our associates and is being done on terms that are fair to our public shareholders with that ill turn the call over to tim timothy g frommeyer  senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark and good morning ill begin my discussion with the few comments on the components of net income before getting into some detail on the quarters operating performance during the quarter we had  million of net realized losses impairments were  million a level similar to the first quarter half of which were related to securities backed by subprime or alta collateral and another  driven by other structured investments looking at the asset classes that has driven the maturity of our impairments we have invested primarily in assets with high credit quality and good subordination we remain comfortable with this exposure which only represents  of our total general account portfolio the other significant impact to net income was driven by the accounting for living benefit liabilities and associated hedges this quarter there was a  million net gain driven primarily by a reduction in the liabilities versus last quarter as mark noted operating expenses were negatively impacted by several significant unusual items in total the unusual item negatively impacted results by about  per share and were driven by dac unlocking tax trueups and other items within the corporate and other segment dac unlocking this quarter negatively impacted consolidated results by  by segment there was a  negative impact in individual investments a one set negative impact in retirement plans partially offset by a  favorable impact in individual protection tax related items also negatively impacted earnings by another  primarily related to a trueup of estimated deductions to actual as we finalized our  return finally in our corporate segment earnings were negatively impacted by  including a  negative impact as an operating gain on structured products was more than offset by operating loss on our trading portfolio in true sense the above normal expenses related to the writedown of our corporate facility thats in the process of being sold excluding these items to more normalized net operating earnings for the quarter were around  per share now turning to the core drivers beginning with revenues equity markets began and ended the quarter below the first quarters daily average but the second quarters daily average was modestly ahead of the first benefiting the quarter on a sequential basis on the yearoveryear comparison the daily market average was down roughly  resulting in a corresponding decline in asset fees volatility of returns on alternative investments reported in the corporate and other segment impacted both prior year and sequential comparisons for net interest spreads additionally at the consolidated level prepayment premiums were  million below prior year and  million below last quarter excluding these volatile items overall net spread margins have remained stable with core spread income flat versus last quarter and down versus prior year driven by the decline in fixed annuity account values finally continued strong sales of fixed life insurance product contributed to the revenue growth in individual protection this quarter with respect to expenses we are continuing to exercise discipline which tops just to maintain our operating margin despite pressure on equity markets and spread related revenues net of unusual items discussed in the current and prior periods operating expenses were lower compared to both comparison periods finally our guidance has been updated to reflect the challenging operating environment the changes are primarily related to lower sales expectations in those businesses most impacted by the current economic environment our core segment operating margin guidance is unchanged the details are provided on our press release that completes my prepared remarks operator please open the call for qa question and answer operator operator instructions the first question comes from collin devine of citigroup please go ahead sir colin devine  citigroup good morning mark mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer good morning colin colin devine  citigroup a couple of questions as weve got first can you confirm there wasnt outside actual appraisal done on in that fashion what that might have revealed as a potential evaluation figure second i was curious as there were any outside offers for the company mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer there was an actual real appraisal done and what i have been told those sets that was not part of negotiations that to the extend if that was used by lazard and the special community in their deliberations that information will be disclosed in the proxy the as far as outside any party solicitations for us the answer is no nationwide mutual made it pretty clear that they were interested in their first offer and weve been told that they were not contracted by anybody during the period colin devine  citigroup okay and then my followup unless ive mistaken the ceo of nationwide mutual is also the ceo jerry jurgenson i wonder if jerry is available this morning to talk about that since i presume given the deal happy ways that he would be aware of what the actual appraisal reveled mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer actually i mean jerry sat on the other side of the transactions in a similar position that i did collin he actually did not have direct involvement in the negotiations im not sure so i would dont believe he is aware of the details of that either because he really wasnt involved in negotiations on either side colin devine  citigroup now that its done im curious why he is not is he available this morning and if not where is he mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer i am not sure colin devine  citigroup so the bottom line is he is not available for his own conference call mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer well collin in these conference call as you know historically i handle the calls since he was not involved specifically in the negotiations the conclusion was he wouldnt add to the discussion colin devine  citigroup okay and then maybe the finally piece in terms of what managements getting comped out of this that would cover yourself and jerry and such how is this going to be handled there was a little problem for me to try to understand it from the annual proxy statement mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer colin i missed that how we are going to get paid is that the question colin devine  citigroup yes in terms of what vest and all that mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer i mean obviously any stock we you would understand from the proxy we are going to get paid the same  where everybody else is okay and as far as options jerry and i will be treated the same way as all other option holders which all options will vest at the closing and any options that have a strike price lower than  we will get paid the difference and any options that at a strike price higher than that will just be cancelled colin devine  citigroup okay and i assume this is probably our last conference call mark so on personal note its been quite a time but thanks very much mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer wellthank you colin operator the next question comes from darin arita of deutsche bank please go ahead darin arita  deutsche bank hi good morning mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer good morning darin arita  deutsche bank congratulations on getting the deal done and also getting a higher price there the question on in terms of your nationwide financial post this deal how does this change and what are your doing strategically will you be able to do certain things you couldnt before can you talk a little bit about that mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer yes obviously a lot of work to go here but i mean we have been working in the past year on really a strategy around consumers back to channels back to products and thinking more much more outside in the rest of the enterprises is doing the same things so we have been targeting common consumer so i think we will be able to reach different consumers more effectively with all of our products this way thats one of the primary things that we expect to be able to do the core businesses of nationwide financials are annuity business are life insurance are retirement plans business the bank mutual funds are all very important to the future strategies of nationwide its really if we can believe we can bring them more effectively to common consumers with a more simplified ownership structure darin arita  deutsche bank do you think your ability to do larger ma deals has increased mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer not necessarily because i mean in this situation i mean now we would do all ma deals i guess with cash so that doesnt really change that darin arita  deutsche bank okay i was just thinking you would be a part of a larger capitalized company so  mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer but we now have the combined capital obviously the entire enterprise both our access capital as well as their capital position well have to evaluate that post the transaction timothy g frommeyer  senior vice president and chief financial officer and dan this is tim i would just add that we will get some benefits from the persecution of risk at the top of the house which we dont get right now darin arita  deutsche bank okay great thanks very much operator the next question comes from carrie petra ph of sourcemedia please go ahead unidentified analyst hello i am representing retirement income reporter magazine and i have a two quick questions the first is how do you think the remutualization will affect your variable annuity business and your retirement business mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer well again well technically not remutualizing i mean we are just to clarify that i mean we are being acquired by a mutual company and we own  of this today so i think in both of those businesses they will continue to be strong for us i dont think the transaction in any way takes away from our ability to execute if anything it enhances our ability to execute across those businesses so i feel this is a positive as i said a business ability to focus on common consumers common business partners across the enterprise for both of those things unidentified analyst okay and then second part you mentioned earlier that the simplified owner structural allowed you to be more customer centric do you believe that in your experience or generally that a nonpublic company insurance company and financial services company can be more responsible more responsive to its customers than a publicly hold company mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer i wouldnt say that what i really what i meant was since we have customers across the enterprise whether you look at the our auto insurance customers or our homeowners customers our life insurance customers because of the ownership structure we have tended to look at serve build products for those customers in our individual legal entity siloeds and i think that by eliminating those and actually looking at customers on more common way we can bring all of those products together so its not so much public versus private as much as one company versus two separate companies unidentified analyst okay thank you operator the next question comes from jeff schuman of kbw please go ahead jeffrey schuman  kbw hi mark it doesnt sound like there are lot of contingencies can you just us walk through kind what are the basic steps it has to happen to get this closed and when you might anticipate the proxy being filed please mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer yes we will get start working on the proxy and get its filed as soon as possible and well and really the probably the biggest variable that we have is the sec and their review or lack of review of that proxy statement and what comments they may have weve got certain other insurance apartment of regulatory approvals but i think those are not significant they are small so its really the timing question is mainly around the sec review of the proxy jeffrey schuman  kbw okay great thank you operator the next question comes from suneet kamath of sanford bernstein please go ahead suneet kamath  sanford bernstein good morning just two questions first i think we all sort of observed that some of the changes that gaap accounting has really created some volatility in some of the products that life insurance companies are offering as well some of the volatility related to marktomarket and the investment portfolio given that you are probably not going to be confined by the constructs of gaap accounting going forward and reset my assumption maybe just a followup to darins question are there areas that either have invariable annuity business revenue investment portfolio where you think you might be able to be a little bit more aggressive given you are no longer subject to the volatility and gaap and the second question i guess for mark i think in your prepared remarks you talked about some competition in the variable annuity business and perhaps some feature wars and i think you had said that youre not quite seeing a rational pricing but you had some comments around pricing can you just provide a little bit more detail there thanks mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer first to your first question we will still be a sec filing and we do have to follow gaap i mean as a sponsor of the various registry products as well as public debt or our mediumterm note program and so on so we will still have gaap accounting to follow and well be filing with the sec so having said that i think we will continue to take a look at both our investment portfolio and make sure that we continue as we always have is to manage both the investment portfolio as well as our products on an economic basis and not necessarily worry about accounting volatility if we are comfortable with whats going on an economic basis i think it my comments generally whether it was really all products more than lets focus just on vas i mean i think were continuing nsv some price pressures in the following case space but i think there are companies coming kind of in and out of the market and fixed universal life products tend to be a little bit more aggressive i think we see that there are some additional competition now in we are calling portfolio income insurance providing some of the guarantees around managed account and that seems to be pretty competitive to start with so and just a general comment across the board its not one specific product but i think the in many cases people are being a little more competitive in the though market suneet kamath  sanford bernstein okay thanks and best of luck mark r thresher  president and chief operating officer thank you operator there are no other questions at this time i would like to turn the conference over to mr mark barnett for any closing comments mark barnett  vice president of investor relations alright thank you andrew again we would like to thank everyone for taking the time to join us and as always if you have any additional questions feel free to call myself or any one on the investor relations team thank you and have a great day operator
