proporcionen más del mínimo estatutario de  días de aviso para las asambleas anuales de los accionistas la comunicación de la bmv señaló que la recomendación fue hecha después de ser consultada con la comisión nacional bancaria y de valores cnbv y citó la solicitud de cartica para que las emisoras realicen los avisos y que todos los materiales de apoyo estén disponibles electrónicamente por lo menos  días antes de cualquier asamblea de accionistas cartica agradece a la bmv y a la cnbv por su capacidad de respuesta a las preocupaciones de los inversionistas sobre cómo los cortos periodos de aviso practicados por muchas de las más importantes emisoras mexicanas han estado privando los derechos de los accionistas minoritarios esperamos que las emisoras tomen la recomendación de la bmv y que en esta próxima temporada de asambleas un porcentaje alto de emisoras mexicanas proporcione a sus accionistas  días de aviso de sus asambleas generales anuales y al mismo tiempo otorguen todos los materiales de apoyo electrónicamente si esto pasa sólo puede ser positivo para el mercado para los accionistas y en última instancia para las propias compañías dijo mike lubrano director general de gobierno corporativo y sustentabilidad de cartica el  de enero cartica emitió un comunicado haciendo pública su solicitud formal a la cnbv y a la bmv para exigir a todas las emisoras públicas en méxico  extender el periodo para el aviso previo de las asambleas de accionistas hasta por lo menos  días y  rescindir las disposiciones de los estatutos que requieren la aprobación del consejo de administración para que un accionista adquiera un  de las acciones con derecho a voto y ejerza su derecho estatutario de nominar a un director para el consejo otros grandes inversionistas institucionales incluyendo aberdeen asset management franklin templeton investments calpers y calstrs están apoyando activamente los esfuerzos de cartica cartica y estos inversionistas continuarán abogando por las medidas legales y regulatorias para exigir a las compañías listadas que rescindan las disposiciones de los estatutos que requieren la aprobación del consejo o de la mayoría de los accionistas antes de que un accionista minoritario pueda adquirir el  de las acciones con derecho a voto y ejerzer su derecho estatutario a elegir a un director para el consejo los redactores de la ley de mercados de valores de méxico fueron sabios al empoderar a la minoría de los accionistas a elegir a un director para los consejos los cuales están típicamente dominados por los nominados del controlador las disposiciones de los estatutos que intentan quitar este contrapeso a la dominación de los accionistas mayoritarios es ilegal y el regulador y la bolsa deberían unirse a los inversionistas para insistir en que sean retirados dijo el sr lubrano about cartica management llc cartica management llc wwwcarticacom es una firma global de gestión de activos alternos centrada en
