handed me this book a short time back knowing how i admire adam hamiltons sermons and writings he is the senior pastor of the united methodist church of the resurrection in leawood kansas why is a small book only about a third of an inch thick about four inches wide by seven high but its packed with wisdom from cover to cover the book is dedicated to two friends pastor hamilton held in high regard gary and danny patterson the two suffered what he classified as an untimely death and the book is pastor hamiltons attempt to make sense of their senseless deaths he talks about why innocents suffer why prayers seem to go unanswered why gods will seems obscure and why gods love prevails if these questions have plagued you too you might want to pick up a copy was this review helpful helpful
