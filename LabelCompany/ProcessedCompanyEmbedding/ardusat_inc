ardusat brings i built this moments to your classroom ardusat is a learning experience platform combining studentfriendly hardware kits with webbased lesson plans in each experiment students use ardusat to build code and show off what they’re learning this isn’t a runofthemill lecture or a project that takes two months every single experiment can be done in a class period or two giving your students plenty of building experience we’ve designed our experiments around next generation science standards ngss and other educational standards but our handson approach to learning stem does more than meet rigorous standards it inspires students to understand how these subjects work in the real world and when students get excited teachers win what is ardusat our sensor kits and software do more than teach science technology engineering and math they help students learn to think like scientists developing critical thinking problemsolving scientific and digital literacy skills they’ll need throughout their lives ehub our webbased home for our learning experiences teachers can browse through predesigned labs personalize them or publish their own our classroom management features save you time so you can focus on inspiring students to become explorers right in the classroom we’re constantly adding new lessons and experiments aligned with ngss and other educational standards

population — advocateusage there are two courses that could use this product one class is the maker class that would like to do more circuitry work and the kits look like they could fit the bill one class is about coding and we could use it to look closer at coding the circuitry we could use the experiment in our science classes to make more real world connections to the contentstrengths the ability to cross the subjects is a major plus for this project stem schools could use it in mulitple wayssuggestions for improvement its still a little pricey for most schools to use large scale if there was a way to make the kits more affordable would probably make the product more accessibleverdict i think you could use it across different classes from math to science to computer sciencesep   david learning through interest coordinator school type high school project based school  devices byod devices blended learning — advocateusage i would use this in a focused project session where students would work for a focused design challenge over  weeks strengths i love how they are building some structure into utilizing arduinos and also making the design process authentic possibly going to space and as an earth science teacher i also like how the technology is helping to convey complex planetary processes suggestions for improvement not sure yet perhaps finding other organized ways to put these devices to use undersea experiments atmospheric experiments gettting researchers and explorers to put them in remote places like antarctica or mt everestverdict for our new school these tools and resources help us build our practicesep   aimee teacher school type high school low income population college prep school  devices — neutralusage it only has functionality in a physics and computer science integrated coursestrengths it would integrate authentically computer science and physics the data from the probeware is available anywhere there is a computersuggestions for improvement  have a noncoding option im not willing to learn to code to use a probeware that doesnt have the same functionality that other probeware does  expand your functions this appeals only to a very limited market because it doesnt have much applicability outside of a physics andor computer science classroom  have a noncoding option again i dont want to use the limited time i have to teach chemistry to also try to teach my students codingverdict if the course is integrating physics and computer programming this item seems like it would fit well but otherwise it doesnt have a broad enough application to be relevant to other contents it doesnt have probes for other metrics like specific chemical signatures and although it can integrate with other probes that requires writing or finding the code to integrate it which brings me to my next point it requires knowing some coding maybe not a lot but i and most of the teachers even most of the science teachers dont know any and my students by and large dont know any so there would need to be extra time spent teaching myself then them how to code before i could even begin to teach them about sciencesep   rana math and physics

their website suggestions for improvement getting it into the classroom at  is pretty steep the ability to find a cheaper way to fund no low cost modelverdict i think the idea is great and the ability to program a device is critical in this day in age having premade lessons on how to use the ardruino based unit is crucial sep   sharon director of innovation school type elementary school middle

already bought ardunios  grove sensors i love that curriculum is open source suggestions for improvement work w blackly and python develop online course mapping new csta standards to connections with
