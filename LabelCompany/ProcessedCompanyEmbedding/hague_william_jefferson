of the bank of england from then and until the  general election hagues supporters waged an increasingly bitter battle with portillos faction such internecine war significantly contributed to the

hague said we have a government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs there is nothing that the british people can talk about that this labour government doesnt deride talk about europe and they call you extreme talk about tax and they call you greedy talk about crime and they call you reactionary talk about immigration and they call you racist talk about your nation and they call you little englanders this government thinks britain would be all right if we had a different people i think britain would be all right if only we had a different government a conservative government that speaks with the voice of the british people a conservative government never embarrassed or ashamed of the british people a conservative government that trusts the people  this country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice conservative governments always have and always will but its precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside

wednesday in parliament having difficulty to find fault during one particular exchange while responding to the queens speech of  hague attacked the prime ministers record in more than  years in politics he has betrayed every cause he believed in contradicted every statement he has made broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into there is a lifetime of uturns errors and sellouts all those honourable members who sit behind the prime minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer or whether they defend any point of principle know who has led them to that sorry state blair responded by criticising what he saw as hagues bandwagon politics  he started the fuel protest bandwagon then the floods bandwagon on defence it became armourplated then on air traffic control it became airborne yes the right honourable gentleman made a very witty funny speech but it summed up his leadership good jokes lousy judgment i am afraid that in the end if the right honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out and offer a vision for the countrys future not a vision that would take us backwards resignation on the morning of labours second consecutive landslide victory at the  general election hague stated we have not been able to persuade a majority or anything approaching a majority that we are yet the alternative government that they need at the  general election the conservative party gained just one parliamentary seat more than at

foreign secretary and senior member of the shadow cabinet effectively serving as camerons deputy though not formally unlike previous deputy conservative leaders willie whitelaw peter lilley and

foreign policy is domestic policy written large the values we live by at home do not stop at our shores human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy but they are indivisible from it not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human hague further said that there will be no downgrading of human rights under this government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development he continued saying that indeed i intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work it is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience and neither is it in our interests however in march  hague was criticised by cardinal keith obrien for increasing financial aid to pakistan despite persecution of its christian minority to increase aid to the pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an antichristian foreign policy in september  hague told bbc radio s file on  investigation cyber spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the uk to countries with questionable

friendship with yearold christopher myers a history graduate from durham university whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser a spokesperson stated that any suggestion that the foreign secretarys relationship with chris myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded on  september  myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation which prompted hague to issue a public statement wherein he confirmed that he had occasionally shared a hotel room with myers for reasons of frugality by upbringing but refuting the utterly false suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man a spokesperson for prime minister david cameron reported that he gave his full support over the media rumours figures from both within and without the conservative party criticised hague for his personal response to the stories with former conservative leadership candidate john redwood commenting that hague had shown poor judgement and the speakers wife laboursupporting sally bercow speculating that hague had been given duff pr advice whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague the conservative mp alan duncan described the media coverage as contemptible israel–palestinian conflict hague was criticised by israeli leaders after meeting with palestinians who demonstrated against israels barrier in the west bank he expressed solidarity with the idea of nonviolence and listened to the accounts of leftwing and palestinian activists israeli opposition leader tzipi livni condemned the statements and said the security barrier has saved lives and its construction was necessary the barrier has separated israel from palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in israel where citizens were exposed to terror every day  middle east protests hague meeting saudi defence minister salman of saudi arabia in london  april  in february  security forces in the bahrain dispersed thousands of antigovernment protesters at pearl square in the centre of the capital manama hague informed the house of commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters at least three people died in the operation with hundreds more injured we are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred i have this morning spoken to the foreign minister of bahrain and hm ambassador spoke last night to the bahraini minister of the interior in both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression hague told sky news that the use of force by the libyan authorities during the  libyan civil war was dreadful and horrifying and called on the leader to respect peoples human rights a vicious crackdown led by special forces foreign mercenaries and muammar gaddafi loyalists was launched in the countrys second city benghazi which has been the focus of antiregime protests hague stated to dermot murnaghan on sky i think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation the united kingdom condemns what the libyan government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests and we look to other countries to do the same foreign secretary william hague meeting tunisian foreign affairs minister rafik abdessalem  following delays in extracting british citizens from libya a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight british diplomatssas arrested and no aircraft carriers or harriers to enforce a nofly zone he was accused by the labour opposition of losing his mojo in march  in march  hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north africa and the middle east will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region however following the row over whether libyan leader muammar gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces the foreign secretary stated that the libyan people must be free to determine their own future hague said it is not for us to choose the government of libya—that is for the libyan people themselves but they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on saturday when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat hague has warned that autocratic leaders including robert mugabe president of zimbabwe could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north africa said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including libya and egypt will have a greater historic significance than the  attacks on the us or the recent financial crisis he stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators but warned that they will inevitably face judgement for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy repressive african régimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community the foreign secretary said demands for freedom will spread and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed he added governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever they will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease and will find themselves on the wrong side of history hague and david cameron speaking to nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at the london conference on libya  march  hague on his way to qatar summit in april  called for intensified sanctions on the libyan régime and for a clear statement that gaddafi must go we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians we do look to other countries to do the same if necessary over time we would like a continued increase in our natos capability to protect civilians in libya he added whether nato ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground hague said these air strikes are a response to movements of or attacks from régime forces so what happens will be dependent on that he said whether the americans could again be asked to step up their role would also depend on the circumstances he added hague speaking on the protests in syria said political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay it is thought as many as  people have been killed by security forces in the country today  april  making it the worst day for deaths since protests against president bashar alassad began over a month ago reported bbc news syria speaking on the syrian civil war in august  hague said of military intervention its not a remote possibility even if we were in favour of unbacked military action which we are not because theres no call from the arab league for intervention as in the case of libya there is no prospect of a legal morally sanctioned military intervention hague added that it was a frustrating situation and that the levers at the international communitys disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the assad government we want to see stronger international pressure all round of course to be effective that just cant be pressure from western nations that includes from arab nations and it includes from turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade president assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions he said i would also like to see a united nations security council resolution to condemn this violence to call for the release of political prisoners to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to he added on  february  hague recognised the syrian national council as a legitimate representative of the country hague also said bashar alassads government had forfeited the right to lead by miring itself in the blood of innocent people hague said today we must show that we will not abandon the syrian people in their darkest hour he added that those responsible for the murder of entire families the shelling of homes the execution of detainees the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account he said in march  hague ordered the evacuation of all british diplomats from syria and closed the uk embassy in damascus because of mounting security threats hague told parliament we have maintained an embassy in damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground he added we now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk” hague said that his decision “in no way reduces the uks commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the assad régime to end the violence he went on to say that “we will continue to work closely with other nations to coordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the syrian régime” hague meeting ahmad jarba president of the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces on  september  on  april  hague met  other nations at a friends of syria group conference in istanbul turkey hague said the issue could return to the united nations security council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail the government of president assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the unarab league envoy kofi annan but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition hague accused assad of stalling for time and warned that if the issue does return to the security council he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of russia and china who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down there isnt an unlimited period of time for this for the kofi annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the un security council—some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isnt progress made hague told the bbc he added that what is now being put to them is a plan from kofi annan supported by the whole united nations security council and this is an important point its supported by russia and by china as well as by the more obvious countries—the united states the united kingdom france the arab league and so on on  november  hague recognised the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate representative of the syrian people and a credible alternative to the current syrian government on  august  the british parliament refused to ratify the british governments plan to participate in military strikes against the syrian government in the wake of a chemicalweapons attack at ghouta hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over prime minister david camerons decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote after the vote hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the syrian government saying if it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that noone will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate syrias chemical weapons proposal of elected eu presidency hague carl bildt and radosław sikorski meeting vlad filat prime minister of moldova february  in june  hague dismissed tony blairs vision for an electedhead of the european union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further constitutional tinkering hague made clear his view after blair argued that a directlyelected president of europe representing almost m people from  countries would give the eu clear leadership and enormous authority in an interview with the times blair set out the agenda that he thought a directlyelected eu president should pursue although he conceded there was no chance of such a post being created at the present time asked about the former prime ministers call for further european integration and the creation of an electedpresident hague suggested that blair may have been thinking of the role for himself i cant think who he had in mind hague joked further adding on a serious note elected presidents are for countries the eu is not a country and its not going to become a country in my view now or ever in the future it is a group of countries working together taliban talks in june  hague said that britain helped initiate distasteful peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan hague made the comments while on a threeday tour of the country to meet president hamid karzai and visited british troops he told the sun newspaper that britain had led the way in persuading us president barack obamas administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting distasteful things and could anger military veterans and relatives of the  british troops killed in afghanistan however he said he believed that britain as a whole was realistic and practical enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security he told the newspaper an eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security he added but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful in all these types of situations you do have to face up to some distasteful things the previous night us president barack obama told americans that the tide of war is receding as he announced plans to withdraw  us troops from afghanistan by september  comments on the euro in september  hague said that the euro is a burning building with no exits for some of the countries which adopted the currency hague first used the expression when he was conservative leader in —and said in an interview with the spectator he had been proved right it was folly to create this system it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly but its there and we have to deal with it he said i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it he further said adding i might take the analogy too far but the euro wasnt built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it iran in february  hague warned in a bbc interview about irans increasing willingness to contemplate terrorism around the world he cited the  iran assassination plot an attempt to assassinate adel aljubeir the saudi ambassador to the united states as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in new delhi georgia and bangkok he said it showed the danger iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world hague spoke the commons on  february about the nuclear program of iran and said that if the tehran régime managed to construct a viable weapon its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too he accused iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad of pursuing confrontational policies and described the countrys enrichment of uranium in defiance of united nations security council resolutions as a crisis coming steadily down the track our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy it is important to emphasise to iran that all options are on the table hague told mps in march he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged claiming they were not free and fair he said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people hague said it has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair the régime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives the climate of fear created by the régimes crushing of opposition voices since  persists falkland islands  april  marked the th anniversary of the start of the  falklands war on  march before the lord mayor of londons banquet guests namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than  ambassadors including alicia castro argentinian ambassador hague said the uk was keen to deepen its relationship with latin america—and reiterated britains commitment to the falklands he said we are reversing britain’s decline in latin america where we are opening a new embassy in el salvador this determination to deepen our relations with latin america is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of selfdetermination of the people of the falkland islands tensions over the falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary in february hague said deployments of a british warship hms dauntless and the duke of cambridge to the falklands were entirely routine hague said that britain affirmed the falklanders selfdetermination and would seek to prevent argentina from raising the diplomatic temperature over the issue he further said the events are not so much celebrations as commemorations i think argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict since both countries will be doing that i dont think there is anything provocative about that turks and caicos islands hague set out her majestys government plans on  june  for the reintroduction of selfgovernment in the turks and caicos islands where direct rule of the governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration julian assange and right of asylum in august  hague declared that julian assange the wikileaks organisation founder would not be granted political asylum by the united kingdom hague declared the uks willingness to extradite assange to the swedish authorities who had requested his extradition thus swedish prosecutors unwilling to break diplomatic protocol have deferred from interrogating assange at the embassy of ecuador london hague confirmed the british governments position – that it is lawfully obliged to extradite julian assange were disappointed by the statement by ecuadors foreign minister today that ecuador has offered political asylum to julian assange under our laws with mr assange having exhausted all options of appeal the british authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to sweden we must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so hague confirmed following the guardian newspaper outcry over a foreign office note sanctioned by hague sent to the ecuadorian embassy—in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the diplomatic and consular premises act —the foreign secretary reaffirmed the uk remained committed to a diplomatic solution and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the ecuadorian embassy stating there is no threat here to storm an embassy the former ambassador craig murray warned that using the  act to raid the ecuadorian embassy would be in breach of the vienna convention of  russia warned britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles vienna convention on diplomatic relations and in particular the article  spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises which the government of ecuador invoked hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by parliament leader of the house of commons once hague had formally declared his intention not to seek reelection as mp for richmond at the forthcoming  general election he told cameron that he would be standing down as foreign

out to voters in the north of england in the run up to the general election in a surprise motion on his last day in the house of commons hague moved to make the election for speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent john bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a speaker of the house charles walker chairman of the procedure committee and responsible for speaker elections stated that he had written a report about such an idea years ago and despite speaking with hague and michael gove earlier that week neither had told him of any such move a visibly emotional walker conservative mp for broxbourne told the house i have been played for a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool

oxford university conservative association ouca but was convicted of electoral malpractice in the election process oucas official historian david blair notes that hague was actually elected on a

hague following the  general election defeat hague was elected leader of the conservative party in succession to john major defeating more experienced figures such as kenneth clarke and michael howard at the age of  hague was tasked with rebuilding the conservative party fresh from their worst general election result of the th century by attempting to build a more modern image £ was spent on the listening to britain campaign to try to put the conservatives back in touch with the public after losing power he welcomed ideas about compassionate conservatism including from the thengovernor of texas later president george w bush when he visited a theme park with his chief of staff and former local mp sebastian now lord coe hague took a ride on a log flume wearing a baseball cap emblazoned hague cecil parkinson described the exercise as juvenile hague steered the conservatives to a successful result at the european parliamentary elections in june  where the conservatives gained  meps ahead of labours  his opposition to the single european currency the euro was later vindicated by labour prime minister gordon browns adoption and subsequent approval of the policy hagues authority

general election he was elected as mp for kensington and chelsea at a byelection two years later soon after portillos return to parliament conservative policy of two of labours flagship policies was reversed the minimum wage and independence of the bank of england from then and until the  general election hagues supporters waged an increasingly bitter battle with portillos faction such internecine war significantly contributed to the conservatives two subsequent election defeats hague was widely ridiculed for claiming he used to drink  pints of beer a day as a teenager his reputation suffered further damage when a  poll for the daily telegraph found that  of voters considered him to be a bit of a wally and  of voters believed he would say almost anything to win votes foreign land speech at a party conference speech in march  hague said we have a government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs there is nothing that the british people can talk about that this labour government doesnt deride talk about europe and they call you extreme talk about tax and they call you greedy talk about crime and they call you reactionary talk about immigration and they call you racist talk about your nation and they call you little englanders this government thinks britain would be all right if we had a different people i think britain would be all right if only we had a different government a conservative government that speaks with the voice of the british people a conservative government never embarrassed or ashamed of the british people a conservative government that trusts the people  this country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice conservative governments always have and always will but its precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside former conservative deputy prime minister michael heseltine a prominent onenation conservative was critical of hagues eurosceptic view that britain was becoming a foreign land betraying in newspaper interviews that he was uncertain as to whether he could support a hagueled conservative party skill in debate hagues critics assiduously monitored his performance at prime ministers questions each wednesday in parliament having difficulty to find fault during one particular exchange while responding to the queens speech of  hague attacked the prime ministers record in more than  years in politics he has betrayed every cause he believed in contradicted every statement he has made broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into there is a lifetime of uturns errors and sellouts all those honourable members who sit behind the prime minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer or whether they defend any point of principle know who has led them to that sorry state blair responded by criticising what he saw as hagues bandwagon politics  he started the fuel protest bandwagon then the floods bandwagon on defence it became armourplated then on air traffic control it became airborne yes the right honourable gentleman made a very witty funny speech but it summed up his leadership good jokes lousy judgment i am afraid that in the end if the right honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out and offer a vision for the countrys future not a vision that would take us backwards resignation on the morning of labours second consecutive landslide victory at the  general election hague stated we have not been able to persuade a majority or anything approaching a majority that we are yet the alternative government that they need at the  general election the

friends of israel a group which he joined when he was  return to the shadow cabinet after the  general election the conservative party leader michael howard apparently offered hague the post of shadow

of the conservative party hague was offered and accepted the role of shadow foreign secretary and senior member of the shadow cabinet effectively serving as camerons deputy though not formally unlike previous deputy conservative leaders willie whitelaw peter lilley and michael ancram he had been widely tipped to return to the frontbench under either cameron or leadership contest runnerup david davis on  january  by camerons instructions hague travelled to brussels for talks to pull conservative party meps out of the european peoples party–european democrats group epped in the european parliament daily telegraph  january  further on  february  hague deputed during david camerons paternity leave at prime ministers questions pmqs this appearance gave rise to jokes at the expense of

conservatives by hague hague again deputised for cameron for several sessions in  foreign secretary hague met us secretary of state hillary clinton after his appointment as foreign secretary hague met

title of first secretary of state in his first overseas visit as british foreign secretary hague met us secretary of state hillary clinton at washington in august  hague set out a valuesbased foreign policy stating that we cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience foreign policy is domestic policy written large the values we live by at home do not stop at our shores human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy but they are indivisible from it not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human hague further said that there will be no downgrading of human rights under this government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development he continued saying that indeed i intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work it is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience and neither is it in our interests however in march  hague was criticised by cardinal keith obrien for increasing financial aid to pakistan despite persecution of its christian minority to increase aid to the pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an antichristian foreign policy in september  hague told bbc radio s file on  investigation cyber spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the uk to countries with questionable human rights records that the uk had a strong export licence system the programme also obtained confirmation from the uks department for business innovation and skills that cyber surveillance products that break as opposed to create encryption do not require export licences in june  he continued to stand in for david cameron at pmqs when both the prime minister and deputy prime minister nick clegg were out of the country in january  hague visited new zealand in his capacity as secretary of state for commonwealth affairs holding talks with fellow commonwealth government ministers murray mccully and david shearer media reaction to fco appointment in early september  newspapers including the daily telegraph the independent and daily mail released stories about allegations surrounding hagues friendship with yearold christopher myers a history graduate from durham university whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser a spokesperson stated that any suggestion that the foreign secretarys relationship with chris myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded on  september  myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation which prompted hague to issue a public statement wherein he confirmed that he had occasionally shared a hotel room with myers for reasons of frugality by upbringing but refuting the utterly false suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man a spokesperson for prime minister david cameron reported that he gave his full support over the media rumours figures from both within and without the conservative party criticised hague for his personal response to the stories with former conservative leadership candidate john redwood commenting that hague had shown poor judgement and the speakers wife laboursupporting sally bercow speculating that hague had been given duff pr advice whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague the conservative mp alan duncan described the media coverage as contemptible israel–palestinian conflict hague was criticised by israeli leaders after meeting with palestinians who demonstrated against israels barrier in the west bank he expressed solidarity with the idea of nonviolence and listened to the accounts of leftwing and palestinian activists israeli opposition leader tzipi livni condemned the statements and said the security barrier has saved lives and its construction was necessary the barrier has separated israel from palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in israel where citizens were exposed to terror every day  middle east protests hague meeting saudi defence minister salman of saudi arabia in london  april  in february  security forces in the bahrain dispersed thousands of antigovernment protesters at pearl square in the centre of the capital manama hague informed the house of commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters at least three people died in the operation with hundreds more injured we are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred i have this morning spoken to the foreign minister of bahrain and hm ambassador spoke last night to the bahraini minister of the interior in both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression hague told sky news that the use of force by the libyan authorities during the  libyan civil war was dreadful and horrifying and called on the leader to respect peoples human rights a vicious crackdown led by special forces foreign mercenaries and muammar gaddafi loyalists was launched in the countrys second city benghazi which has been the focus of antiregime protests hague stated to dermot murnaghan on sky i think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation the united kingdom condemns what the libyan government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests and we look to other countries to do the same foreign secretary william hague meeting tunisian foreign affairs minister rafik abdessalem  following delays in extracting british citizens from libya a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight british diplomatssas arrested and no aircraft carriers or harriers to enforce a nofly zone he was accused by the labour opposition of losing his mojo in march  in march  hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north africa and the middle east will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region however following the row over whether libyan leader muammar gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces the foreign secretary stated that the libyan people must be free to determine their own future hague said it is not for us to choose the government of libya—that is for the libyan people themselves but they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on saturday when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat hague has warned that autocratic leaders including robert mugabe president of zimbabwe could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north africa said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including libya and egypt will have a greater historic significance than the  attacks on the us or the recent financial crisis he stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators but warned that they will inevitably face judgement for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy repressive african régimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community the foreign secretary said demands for freedom will spread and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed he added governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever they will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease and will find themselves on the wrong side of history hague and david cameron speaking to nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at the london conference on libya  march  hague on his way to qatar summit in april  called for intensified sanctions on the libyan régime and for a clear statement that gaddafi must go we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians we do look to other countries to do the same if necessary over time we would like a continued increase in our natos capability to protect civilians in libya he added whether nato ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground hague said these air strikes are a response to movements of or attacks from régime forces so what happens will be dependent on that he said whether the americans could again be asked to step up their role would also depend on the circumstances he added hague speaking on the protests in syria said political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay it is thought as many as  people have been killed by security forces in the country today  april  making it the worst day for deaths since protests against president bashar alassad began over a month ago reported bbc news syria speaking on the syrian civil war in august  hague said of military intervention its not a remote possibility even if we were in favour of unbacked military action which we are not because theres no call from the arab league for intervention as in the case of libya there is no prospect of a legal morally sanctioned military intervention hague added that it was a frustrating situation and that the levers at the international communitys disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the assad government we want to see stronger international pressure all round of course to be effective that just cant be pressure from western nations that includes from arab nations and it includes from turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade president assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions he said i would also like to see a united nations security council resolution to condemn this violence to call for the release of political prisoners to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to he added on  february  hague recognised the syrian national council as a legitimate representative of the country hague also said bashar alassads government had forfeited the right to lead by miring itself in the blood of innocent people hague said today we must show that we will not abandon the syrian people in their darkest hour he added that those responsible for the murder of entire families the shelling of homes the execution of detainees the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account he said in march  hague ordered the evacuation of all british diplomats from syria and closed the uk embassy in damascus because of mounting security threats hague told parliament we have maintained an embassy in damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground he added we now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk” hague said that his decision “in no way reduces the uks commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the assad régime to end the violence he went on to say that “we will continue to work closely with other nations to coordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the syrian régime” hague meeting ahmad jarba president of the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces on  september  on  april  hague met  other nations at a friends of syria group conference in istanbul turkey hague said the issue could return to the united nations security council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail the government of president assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the unarab league envoy kofi annan but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition hague accused assad of stalling for time and warned that if the issue does return to the security council he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of russia and china who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down there isnt an unlimited period of time for this for the kofi annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the un security council—some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isnt progress made hague told the bbc he added that what is now being put to them is a plan from kofi annan supported by the whole united nations security council and this is an important point its supported by russia and by china as well as by the more obvious countries—the united states the united kingdom france the arab league and so on on  november  hague recognised the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate representative of the syrian people and a credible alternative to the current syrian government on  august  the british parliament refused to ratify the british governments plan to participate in military strikes against the syrian government in the wake of a chemicalweapons attack at ghouta hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over prime minister david camerons decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote after the vote hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the syrian government saying if it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that noone will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate syrias chemical weapons proposal of elected eu presidency hague carl bildt and radosław sikorski meeting vlad filat prime minister of moldova february  in june  hague dismissed tony blairs vision for an electedhead of the european union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further constitutional tinkering hague made clear his view after blair argued that a directlyelected president of europe representing almost m people from  countries would give the eu clear leadership and enormous authority in an interview with the times blair set out the agenda that he thought a directlyelected eu president should pursue although he conceded there was no chance of such a post being created at the present time asked about the former prime ministers call for further european integration and the creation of an electedpresident hague suggested that blair may have been thinking of the role for himself i cant think who he had in mind hague joked further adding on a serious note elected presidents are for countries the eu is not a country and its not going to become a country in my view now or ever in the future it is a group of countries working together taliban talks in june  hague said that britain helped initiate distasteful peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan hague made the comments while on a threeday tour of the country to meet president hamid karzai and visited british troops he told the sun newspaper that britain had led the way in persuading us president barack obamas administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting distasteful things and could anger military veterans and relatives of the  british troops killed in afghanistan however he said he believed that britain as a whole was realistic and practical enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security he told the newspaper an eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security he added but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful in all these types of situations you do have to face up to some distasteful things the previous night us president barack obama told americans that the tide of war is receding as he announced plans to withdraw  us troops from afghanistan by september  comments on the euro in september  hague said that the euro is a burning building with no exits for some of the countries which adopted the currency hague first used the expression when he was conservative leader in —and said in an interview with the spectator he had been proved right it was folly to create this system it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly but its there and we have to deal with it he said i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it he further said adding i might take the analogy too far but the euro wasnt built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it iran in february  hague warned in a bbc interview about irans increasing willingness to contemplate terrorism around the world he cited the  iran assassination plot an attempt to assassinate adel aljubeir the saudi ambassador to the united states as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in new delhi georgia and bangkok he said it showed the danger iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world hague spoke the commons on  february about the nuclear program of iran and said that if the tehran régime managed to construct a viable weapon its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too he accused iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad of pursuing confrontational policies and described the countrys enrichment of uranium in defiance of united nations security council resolutions as a crisis coming steadily down the track our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy it is important to emphasise to iran that all options are on the table hague told mps in march he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged claiming they were not free and fair he said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people hague said it has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair the régime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives the climate of fear created by the régimes crushing of opposition voices since  persists falkland islands  april  marked the th anniversary of the start of the  falklands war on  march before the lord mayor of londons banquet guests namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than  ambassadors including alicia castro argentinian ambassador hague said the uk was keen to deepen its relationship with latin america—and reiterated britains commitment to the falklands he said we are reversing britain’s decline in latin america where we are opening a new embassy in el salvador this determination to deepen our relations with latin america is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of selfdetermination of the people of the falkland islands tensions over the falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary in february hague said deployments of a british warship hms dauntless and the duke of cambridge to the falklands were entirely routine hague said that britain affirmed the falklanders selfdetermination and would seek to prevent argentina from raising the diplomatic temperature over the issue he further said the events are not so much celebrations as commemorations i think argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict since both countries will be doing that i dont think there is anything provocative about that turks and caicos islands hague set out her majestys government plans on  june  for the reintroduction of selfgovernment in the turks and caicos islands where direct rule of the governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration julian assange and right of asylum in august  hague declared that julian assange the wikileaks organisation founder would not be granted political asylum by the united kingdom hague declared the uks willingness to extradite assange to the swedish authorities who had requested his extradition thus swedish prosecutors unwilling to break diplomatic protocol have deferred from interrogating assange at the embassy of ecuador london hague confirmed the british governments position – that it is lawfully obliged to extradite julian assange were disappointed by the statement by ecuadors foreign minister today that ecuador has offered political asylum to julian assange under our laws with mr assange having exhausted all options of appeal the british authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to sweden we must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so hague confirmed following the guardian newspaper outcry over a foreign office note sanctioned by hague sent to the ecuadorian embassy—in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the diplomatic and consular premises act —the foreign secretary reaffirmed the uk remained committed to a diplomatic solution and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the ecuadorian embassy stating there is no threat here to storm an embassy the former ambassador craig murray warned that using the  act to raid the ecuadorian embassy would be in breach of the vienna convention of  russia warned britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles vienna convention on diplomatic relations and in particular the article  spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises which the government of ecuador invoked hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by parliament leader of the house of commons once hague had formally declared his intention not to seek reelection as mp for richmond at the forthcoming  general election he told cameron that he would be standing down as foreign secretary cameron instigated a cabinet reshuffle whereby hague became leader of the house of commons hague retained his membership of the national security council and played a lead role in reaching out to voters in the north of england in the run up to the general election in a surprise motion on his last day in the house of commons hague moved to make the election for speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent john bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a speaker of the house charles walker chairman of the procedure committee and responsible for speaker elections stated that he had written a report about such an idea years ago and despite speaking with hague and michael gove earlier that week neither had told him of any such move a visibly emotional walker conservative mp for broxbourne told the house i have been played for a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me walker received a standing ovation mainly from the labour benches for holding fast to values whilst the government

juvenile hague steered the conservatives to a successful result at the european parliamentary elections in june  where the conservatives gained  meps ahead of labours  his opposition to the single

kensington and chelsea at a byelection two years later soon after portillos return to parliament conservative policy of two of labours flagship policies was reversed the minimum wage and independence of the bank of england from then and until the  general election hagues supporters waged an increasingly bitter battle with portillos faction such internecine war significantly contributed to the conservatives two subsequent election defeats hague was widely ridiculed for claiming he used to drink  pints of beer a day as a teenager his reputation suffered further damage when a  poll for the daily telegraph found that  of voters considered him to be a bit of a wally and  of voters believed he would say almost anything to win votes foreign land speech at a party conference speech in march  hague said we have a government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs there is nothing that the british people can talk about that this labour government doesnt deride talk about europe and they call you extreme talk about tax and they call you greedy talk about crime and they call you reactionary talk about immigration and they call you racist talk about your nation and they call you little englanders this government thinks britain would be all right if we had a different people i think britain would be all right if only we had a different government a conservative government that speaks with the voice of the british people a conservative government never embarrassed or ashamed of the british people a conservative government that trusts the people  this country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice conservative governments always have and always will but its precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside former conservative deputy prime minister michael heseltine a prominent onenation conservative was critical of hagues eurosceptic view that britain was becoming a foreign land betraying in newspaper interviews that he was uncertain as to whether he could support a hagueled conservative party skill in debate hagues critics assiduously monitored his performance at prime ministers questions each wednesday in parliament having difficulty to find fault during one particular exchange while responding to the queens speech of  hague attacked the prime ministers record in more than  years in politics he has betrayed every cause he believed in contradicted every statement he has made broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into there is a lifetime of uturns errors and sellouts all those honourable members who sit behind the prime minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer or whether they defend any point of principle know who has led them to that sorry state blair responded by criticising what he saw as hagues bandwagon politics  he started the fuel protest bandwagon then the floods bandwagon on defence it became armourplated then on air traffic control it became airborne yes the right honourable gentleman made a very witty funny speech but it summed up his leadership good jokes lousy judgment i am afraid that in the end if the right honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out and offer a vision for the countrys future not a vision that would take us backwards resignation on the morning of labours second consecutive landslide victory at the  general election hague stated we have not been able to persuade a majority or anything approaching a majority that we are yet the alternative government that they need at the  general election the conservative party gained just one parliamentary seat more than at

cabinet after the  general election the conservative party leader michael howard apparently offered hague the post of shadow chancellor of the exchequer which he turned down citing that his business

foreign secretary and senior member of the shadow cabinet effectively serving as camerons deputy though not formally unlike previous deputy conservative leaders willie whitelaw peter lilley and

for talks to pull conservative party meps out of the european peoples party–european democrats group epped in the european parliament daily telegraph  january  further on  february  hague deputed

foreign policy is domestic policy written large the values we live by at home do not stop at our shores human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy but they are indivisible from it not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human hague further said that there will be no downgrading of human rights under this government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development he continued saying that indeed i intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work it is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience and neither is it in our interests however in march  hague was criticised by cardinal keith obrien for increasing financial aid to pakistan despite persecution of its christian minority to increase aid to the pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an antichristian foreign policy in september  hague told bbc radio s file on  investigation cyber spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the uk to countries with questionable human rights records that the uk had a strong export licence system the programme also obtained confirmation from the uks department for business innovation and skills that cyber surveillance products

were out of the country in january  hague visited new zealand in his capacity as secretary of state for commonwealth affairs holding talks with fellow commonwealth government ministers murray mccully and david shearer media reaction to fco appointment in early september  newspapers including the daily telegraph the independent and daily mail released stories about allegations surrounding hagues friendship with yearold christopher myers a history graduate from durham university whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser a spokesperson stated that any suggestion that the foreign secretarys relationship with chris myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded on  september  myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation which prompted hague to issue a public statement wherein he confirmed that he had occasionally shared a hotel room with myers for reasons of frugality by upbringing but refuting the utterly false suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man a spokesperson for prime minister david cameron reported that he gave his full support over the media rumours figures from both within and without the conservative party criticised hague for his personal response to the stories with former conservative leadership candidate john redwood commenting that hague had shown poor judgement and the speakers wife laboursupporting sally bercow speculating that hague had been given duff pr advice whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague the conservative mp alan duncan described the media coverage as contemptible israel–palestinian conflict hague was criticised by israeli leaders after meeting with palestinians who demonstrated against israels barrier in the west bank he expressed solidarity with the idea of nonviolence and listened to the accounts of leftwing and palestinian activists israeli opposition leader tzipi livni condemned the statements and said the security barrier has saved lives and its construction was necessary the barrier has separated israel from palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in israel where citizens were exposed to terror every day  middle east protests hague meeting saudi defence minister salman of saudi arabia in london  april  in february  security forces in the bahrain dispersed thousands of antigovernment protesters at pearl square in the centre of the capital manama hague informed the house of commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters at least three people died in the operation with hundreds more injured we are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred i have this morning spoken to the foreign minister of bahrain and hm ambassador spoke last night to the bahraini minister of the interior in both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression hague told sky news that the use of force by the libyan authorities during the  libyan civil war was dreadful and horrifying and called on the leader to respect peoples human rights a vicious crackdown led by special forces foreign mercenaries and muammar gaddafi loyalists was launched in the countrys second city benghazi which has been the focus of antiregime protests hague stated to dermot murnaghan on sky i think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation the united kingdom condemns what the libyan government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests and we look to other countries to do the same foreign secretary william hague meeting tunisian foreign affairs minister rafik abdessalem  following delays in extracting british citizens from libya a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight british diplomatssas arrested and no aircraft carriers or harriers to enforce a nofly zone he was accused by the labour opposition of losing his mojo in march  in march  hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north africa and the middle east will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region however following the row over whether libyan leader muammar gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces the foreign secretary stated that the libyan people must be free to determine their own future hague said it is not for us to choose the government of libya—that is for the libyan people themselves but they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on saturday when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat hague has warned that autocratic leaders including robert mugabe president of zimbabwe could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north africa said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including libya and egypt will have a greater historic significance than the  attacks on the us or the recent financial crisis he stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators but warned that they will inevitably face judgement for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy repressive african régimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community the foreign secretary said demands for freedom will spread and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed he added governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever they will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease and will find themselves on the wrong side of history hague and david cameron speaking to nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at the london conference on libya  march  hague on his way to qatar summit in april  called for intensified sanctions on the libyan régime and for a clear statement that gaddafi must go we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians we do look to other countries to do the same if necessary over time we would like a continued increase in our natos capability to protect civilians in libya he added whether nato ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground hague said these air strikes are a response to movements of or attacks from régime forces so what happens will be dependent on that he said whether the americans could again be asked to step up their role would also depend on the circumstances he added hague speaking on the protests in syria said political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay it is thought as many as  people have been killed by security forces in the country today  april  making it the worst day for deaths since protests against president bashar alassad began over a month ago reported bbc news syria speaking on the syrian civil war in august  hague said of military intervention its not a remote possibility even if we were in favour of unbacked military action which we are not because theres no call from the arab league for intervention as in the case of libya there is no prospect of a legal morally sanctioned military intervention hague added that it was a frustrating situation and that the levers at the international communitys disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the assad government we want to see stronger international pressure all round of course to be effective that just cant be pressure from western nations that includes from arab nations and it includes from turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade president assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions he said i would also like to see a united nations security council resolution to condemn this violence to call for the release of political prisoners to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to he added on  february  hague recognised the syrian national council as a legitimate representative of the country hague also said bashar alassads government had forfeited the right to lead by miring itself in the blood of innocent people hague said today we must show that we will not abandon the syrian people in their darkest hour he added that those responsible for the murder of entire families the shelling of homes the execution of detainees the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account he said in march  hague ordered the evacuation of all british diplomats from syria and closed the uk embassy in damascus because of mounting security threats hague told parliament we have maintained an embassy in damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground he added we now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk” hague said that his decision “in no way reduces the uks commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the assad régime to end the violence he went on to say that “we will continue to work closely with other nations to coordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the syrian régime” hague meeting ahmad jarba president of the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces on  september  on  april  hague met  other nations at a friends of syria group conference in istanbul turkey hague said the issue could return to the united nations security council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail the government of president assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the unarab league envoy kofi annan but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition hague accused assad of stalling for time and warned that if the issue does return to the security council he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of russia and china who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down there isnt an unlimited period of time for this for the kofi annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the un security council—some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isnt progress made hague told the bbc he added that what is now being put to them is a plan from kofi annan supported by the whole united nations security council and this is an important point its supported by russia and by china as well as by the more obvious countries—the united states the united kingdom france the arab league and so on on  november  hague recognised the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate representative of the syrian people and a credible alternative to the current syrian government on  august  the british parliament refused to ratify the british governments plan to participate in military strikes against the syrian government in the wake of a chemicalweapons attack at ghouta hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over prime minister david camerons decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote after the vote hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the syrian government saying if it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that noone will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate syrias chemical weapons proposal of elected eu presidency hague carl bildt and radosław sikorski meeting vlad filat prime minister of moldova february  in june  hague dismissed tony blairs vision for an electedhead of the european union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further constitutional tinkering hague made clear his view after blair argued that a directlyelected president of europe representing almost m people from  countries would give the eu clear leadership and enormous authority in an interview with the times blair set out the agenda that he thought a directlyelected eu president should pursue although he conceded there was no chance of such a post being created at the present time asked about the former prime ministers call for further european integration and the creation of an electedpresident hague suggested that blair may have been thinking of the role for himself i cant think who he had in mind hague joked further adding on a serious note elected presidents are for countries the eu is not a country and its not going to become a country in my view now or ever in the future it is a group of countries working together taliban talks in june  hague said that britain helped initiate distasteful peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan hague made the comments while on a threeday tour of the country to meet president hamid karzai and visited british troops he told the sun newspaper that britain had led the way in persuading us president barack obamas administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting distasteful things and could anger military veterans and relatives of the  british troops killed in afghanistan however he said he believed that britain as a whole was realistic and practical enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security he told the newspaper an eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security he added but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful in all these types of situations you do have to face up to some distasteful things the previous night us president barack obama told americans that the tide of war is receding as he announced plans to withdraw  us troops from afghanistan by september  comments on the euro in september  hague said that the euro is a burning building with no exits for some of the countries which adopted the currency hague first used the expression when he was conservative leader in —and said in an interview with the spectator he had been proved right it was folly to create this system it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly but its there and we have to deal with it he said i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it he further said adding i might take the analogy too far but the euro wasnt built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it iran in february  hague warned in a bbc interview about irans increasing willingness to contemplate terrorism around the world he cited the  iran assassination plot an attempt to assassinate adel aljubeir the saudi ambassador to the united states as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in new delhi georgia and bangkok he said it showed the danger iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world hague spoke the commons on  february about the nuclear program of iran and said that if the tehran régime managed to construct a viable weapon its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too he accused iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad of pursuing confrontational policies and described the countrys enrichment of uranium in defiance of united nations security council resolutions as a crisis coming steadily down the track our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy it is important to emphasise to iran that all options are on the table hague told mps in march he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged claiming they were not free and fair he said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people hague said it has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair the régime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives the climate of fear created by the régimes crushing of opposition voices since  persists falkland islands  april  marked the th anniversary of the start of the  falklands war on  march before the lord mayor of londons banquet guests namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than  ambassadors including alicia castro argentinian ambassador hague said the uk was keen to deepen its relationship with latin america—and reiterated britains commitment to the falklands he said we are reversing britain’s decline in latin america where we are opening a new embassy in el salvador this determination to deepen our relations with latin america is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of selfdetermination of the people of the falkland islands tensions over the falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary in february hague said deployments of a british warship hms dauntless and the duke of cambridge to the falklands were entirely routine hague said that britain affirmed the falklanders selfdetermination and would seek to prevent argentina from raising the diplomatic temperature over the issue he further said the events are not so much celebrations as commemorations i think argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict since both countries will be doing that i dont think there is anything provocative about that turks and caicos islands hague set out her majestys government plans on  june  for the reintroduction of selfgovernment in the turks and caicos islands where direct rule of the governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration julian assange and right of asylum in august  hague declared that julian assange the wikileaks organisation founder would not be granted political asylum by the united kingdom hague declared the uks willingness to extradite assange to the swedish authorities who had requested his extradition thus swedish prosecutors unwilling to break diplomatic protocol have deferred from interrogating assange at the embassy of ecuador london hague confirmed the british governments position – that it is lawfully obliged to extradite julian assange were disappointed by the statement by ecuadors foreign minister today that ecuador has offered political asylum to julian assange under our laws with mr assange having exhausted all options of appeal the british authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to sweden we must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so hague confirmed following the guardian newspaper outcry over a foreign office note sanctioned by hague sent to the ecuadorian embassy—in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the diplomatic and consular premises act —the foreign secretary reaffirmed the uk remained committed to a diplomatic solution and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the ecuadorian embassy stating there is no threat here to storm an embassy the former ambassador craig murray warned that using the  act to raid the ecuadorian embassy would be in breach of the vienna convention of  russia warned britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles vienna convention on diplomatic relations and in particular the article  spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises which the government of ecuador invoked hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by parliament leader of the house of commons once hague had formally declared his intention not to seek reelection as mp for richmond at the forthcoming  general election he told cameron that he would be standing down as foreign secretary cameron instigated a cabinet reshuffle whereby hague became leader of the house of commons hague retained his membership of the national security council and played a lead role in reaching out to voters in the north of england in the run up to the general election in a surprise motion on his last day in the house of commons hague moved to make the election for speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent john bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a speaker of the house charles walker chairman of the procedure committee and responsible for speaker elections stated that he had written a report about such an idea years ago and despite speaking with hague and michael gove earlier that week neither had told him of any such move a visibly emotional walker conservative mp for broxbourne told the house i have been played for a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me walker received a standing ovation mainly from the labour benches for holding fast to values whilst the government lost its parliamentary motion by  to  votes personal life william

reversed the minimum wage and independence of the bank of england from then and until the  general election hagues supporters waged an increasingly bitter battle with portillos faction such

about that this labour government doesnt deride talk about europe and they call you extreme talk about tax and they call you greedy talk about crime and they call you reactionary talk about immigration and they call you racist talk about your nation and they call you little englanders this government thinks britain would be all right if we had a different people i think britain would be all right if only we had a different government a conservative government that speaks with the voice of the british people a conservative government never embarrassed or ashamed of the british people a conservative government that trusts the people  this country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice conservative governments always have and always will but its precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside former conservative deputy prime minister michael heseltine a prominent onenation conservative was critical of hagues eurosceptic view that britain was becoming a foreign land betraying in newspaper interviews that he was uncertain as to whether he could support a hagueled conservative party skill in debate hagues critics assiduously monitored his performance at prime ministers questions each wednesday in parliament having difficulty to find fault during one particular exchange while responding to the queens speech of  hague attacked the prime ministers record in more than  years in politics he has betrayed every cause he believed in contradicted every statement he has made broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into there is a lifetime of uturns errors and sellouts all those honourable members who sit behind the prime minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer or whether they defend any point of principle know who has led them to that sorry state blair responded by criticising what he saw as hagues bandwagon politics  he started the fuel protest bandwagon then the floods bandwagon on defence it became armourplated then on air traffic control it became airborne yes the right honourable gentleman made a very witty funny speech but it summed up his leadership good jokes lousy judgment i am afraid that in the end if the right honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out and offer a vision for the countrys future not a vision that would take us backwards resignation on the morning of labours second consecutive landslide victory at the  general election hague stated we have not been able to persuade a majority or anything approaching a majority that we are yet the alternative government that they need at the  general election the

of the conservative party hague was offered and accepted the role of shadow foreign secretary and senior member of the shadow cabinet effectively serving as camerons deputy though not formally unlike

parliament daily telegraph  january  further on  february  hague deputed during david camerons paternity leave at prime ministers questions pmqs this appearance gave rise to jokes at the expense of

policy stating that we cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience foreign policy is domestic policy written large the values we live by at home do not stop at our shores human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy but they are indivisible from it not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human hague further said that there will be no downgrading of human rights under this government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development he continued saying that indeed i intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work it is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience and neither is it in our interests however in march  hague was criticised by cardinal keith obrien for increasing financial aid to pakistan despite persecution of its christian minority to increase aid to the pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an antichristian foreign policy in september  hague told bbc radio s file on  investigation cyber spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the uk to countries with questionable human rights records that the uk had a strong export licence system the programme also obtained confirmation from the uks

independent and daily mail released stories about allegations surrounding hagues friendship with yearold christopher myers a history graduate from durham university whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser a spokesperson stated that any suggestion that the foreign secretarys relationship with chris myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded on  september  myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation which prompted hague to issue a public statement wherein he confirmed that he had occasionally shared a hotel room with myers for reasons of frugality by upbringing but refuting the utterly false suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man a spokesperson for prime minister david cameron reported that he gave his full support over the media rumours figures from both within and without the conservative party criticised hague for his personal response to the stories with former conservative leadership candidate john redwood commenting that hague had shown poor judgement and the speakers wife laboursupporting sally bercow speculating that hague had been given duff pr advice whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague the conservative mp alan duncan described the media coverage as contemptible israel–palestinian conflict hague was criticised by israeli leaders after meeting with palestinians who demonstrated against israels barrier in the west bank he expressed solidarity with the idea of nonviolence and listened to the accounts of leftwing and palestinian activists israeli opposition leader tzipi livni condemned the statements and said the security barrier has saved lives and its construction was necessary the barrier has separated israel from palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in israel where citizens were exposed to terror every day  middle east protests hague meeting saudi defence minister salman of saudi arabia in london  april  in february  security forces in the bahrain dispersed thousands of antigovernment protesters at pearl square in the centre of the capital manama hague informed the house of commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters at least three people died in the operation with hundreds more injured we are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred i have this morning spoken to the foreign minister of bahrain and hm ambassador spoke last night to the bahraini minister of the interior in both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression hague told sky news that the use of force by the libyan authorities during the  libyan civil war was dreadful and horrifying and called on the leader to respect peoples human rights a vicious crackdown led by special forces foreign mercenaries and muammar gaddafi loyalists was launched in the countrys second city benghazi which has been the focus of antiregime protests hague stated to dermot murnaghan on sky i think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation the united kingdom condemns what the libyan government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests and we look to other countries to do the same foreign secretary william hague meeting tunisian foreign affairs minister rafik abdessalem  following delays in extracting british citizens from libya a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight british diplomatssas arrested and no aircraft carriers or harriers to enforce a nofly zone he was accused by the labour opposition of losing his mojo in march  in march  hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north africa and the middle east will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region however following the row over whether libyan leader muammar gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces the foreign secretary stated that the libyan people must be free to determine their own future hague said it is not for us to choose the government of libya—that is for the libyan people themselves but they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on saturday when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat hague has warned that autocratic leaders including robert mugabe president of zimbabwe could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north africa said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including libya and egypt will have a greater historic significance than the  attacks on the us or the recent financial crisis he stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators but warned that they will inevitably face judgement for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy repressive african régimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community the foreign secretary said demands for freedom will spread and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed he added governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever they will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease and will find themselves on the wrong side of history hague and david cameron speaking to nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at the london conference on libya  march  hague on his way to qatar summit in april  called for intensified sanctions on the libyan régime and for a clear statement that gaddafi must go we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians we do look to other countries to do the same if necessary over time we would like a continued increase in our natos capability to protect civilians in libya he added whether nato ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground hague said these air strikes are a response to movements of or attacks from régime forces so what happens will be dependent on that he said whether the americans could again be asked to step up their role would also depend on the circumstances he added hague speaking on the protests in syria said political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay it is thought as many as  people have been killed by security forces in the country today  april  making it the worst day for deaths since protests against president bashar alassad began over a month ago reported bbc news syria speaking on the syrian civil war in august  hague said of military intervention its not a remote possibility even if we were in favour of unbacked military action which we are not because theres no call from the arab league for intervention as in the case of libya there is no prospect of a legal morally sanctioned military intervention hague added that it was a frustrating situation and that the levers at the international communitys disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the assad government we want to see stronger international pressure all round of course to be effective that just cant be pressure from western nations that includes from arab nations and it includes from turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade president assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions he said i would also like to see a united nations security council resolution to condemn this violence to call for the release of political prisoners to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to he added on  february  hague recognised the syrian national council as a legitimate representative of the country hague also said bashar alassads government had forfeited the right to lead by miring itself in the blood of innocent people hague said today we must show that we will not abandon the syrian people in their darkest hour he added that those responsible for the murder of entire families the shelling of homes the execution of detainees the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account he said in march  hague ordered the evacuation of all british diplomats from syria and closed the uk embassy in damascus because of mounting security threats hague told parliament we have maintained an embassy in damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground he added we now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk” hague said that his decision “in no way reduces the uks commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the assad régime to end the violence he went on to say that “we will continue to work closely with other nations to coordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the syrian régime” hague meeting ahmad jarba president of the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces on  september  on  april  hague met  other nations at a friends of syria group conference in istanbul turkey hague said the issue could return to the united nations security council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail the government of president assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the unarab league envoy kofi annan but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition hague accused assad of stalling for time and warned that if the issue does return to the security council he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of russia and china who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down there isnt an unlimited period of time for this for the kofi annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the un security council—some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isnt progress made hague told the bbc he added that what is now being put to them is a plan from kofi annan supported by the whole united nations security council and this is an important point its supported by russia and by china as well as by the more obvious countries—the united states the united kingdom france the arab league and so on on  november  hague recognised the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate representative of the syrian people and a credible alternative to the current syrian government on  august  the british parliament refused to ratify the british governments plan to participate in military strikes against the syrian government in the wake of a chemicalweapons attack at ghouta hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over prime minister david camerons decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote after the vote hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the syrian government saying if it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that noone will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate syrias chemical weapons proposal of elected eu presidency hague carl bildt and radosław sikorski meeting vlad filat prime minister of moldova february  in june  hague dismissed tony blairs vision for an electedhead of the european union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further constitutional tinkering hague made clear his view after blair argued that a directlyelected president of europe representing almost m people from  countries would give the eu clear leadership and enormous authority in an interview with the times blair set out the agenda that he thought a directlyelected eu president should pursue although he conceded there was no chance of such a post being created at the present time asked about the former prime ministers call for further european integration and the creation of an electedpresident hague suggested that blair may have been thinking of the role for himself i cant think who he had in mind hague joked further adding on a serious note elected presidents are for countries the eu is not a country and its not going to become a country in my view now or ever in the future it is a group of countries working together taliban talks in june  hague said that britain helped initiate distasteful peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan hague made the comments while on a threeday tour of the country to meet president hamid karzai and visited british troops he told the sun newspaper that britain had led the way in persuading us president barack obamas administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting distasteful things and could anger military veterans and relatives of the  british troops killed in afghanistan however he said he believed that britain as a whole was realistic and practical enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security he told the newspaper an eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security he added but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful in all these types of situations you do have to face up to some distasteful things the previous night us president barack obama told americans that the tide of war is receding as he announced plans to withdraw  us troops from afghanistan by september  comments on the euro in september  hague said that the euro is a burning building with no exits for some of the countries which adopted the currency hague first used the expression when he was conservative leader in —and said in an interview with the spectator he had been proved right it was folly to create this system it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly but its there and we have to deal with it he said i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it he further said adding i might take the analogy too far but the euro wasnt built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it iran in february  hague warned in a bbc interview about irans increasing willingness to contemplate terrorism around the world he cited the  iran assassination plot an attempt to assassinate adel aljubeir the saudi ambassador to the united states as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in new delhi georgia and bangkok he said it showed the danger iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world hague spoke the commons on  february about the nuclear program of iran and said that if the tehran régime managed to construct a viable weapon its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too he accused iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad of pursuing confrontational policies and described the countrys enrichment of uranium in defiance of united nations security council resolutions as a crisis coming steadily down the track our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy it is important to emphasise to iran that all options are on the table hague told mps in march he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged claiming they were not free and fair he said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people hague said it has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair the régime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives the climate of fear created by the régimes crushing of opposition voices since  persists falkland islands  april  marked the th anniversary of the start of the  falklands war on  march before the lord mayor of londons banquet guests namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than  ambassadors including alicia castro argentinian ambassador hague said the uk was keen to deepen its relationship with latin america—and reiterated britains commitment to the falklands he said we are reversing britain’s decline in latin america where we are opening a new embassy in el salvador this determination to deepen our relations with latin america is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of selfdetermination of the people of the falkland islands tensions over the falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary in february hague said deployments of a british warship hms dauntless and the duke of cambridge to the falklands were entirely routine hague said that britain affirmed the falklanders selfdetermination and would seek to prevent argentina from raising the diplomatic temperature over the issue he further said the events are not so much celebrations as commemorations i think argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict since both countries will be doing that i dont think there is anything provocative about that turks and caicos islands hague set out her majestys government plans on  june  for the reintroduction of selfgovernment in the turks and caicos islands where direct rule of the governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration julian assange and right of asylum in august  hague declared that julian assange the wikileaks organisation founder would not be granted political asylum by the united kingdom hague declared the uks willingness to extradite assange to the swedish authorities who had requested his extradition thus swedish prosecutors unwilling to break diplomatic protocol have deferred from interrogating assange at the embassy of ecuador london hague confirmed the british governments position – that it is lawfully obliged to extradite julian assange were disappointed by the statement by ecuadors foreign minister today that ecuador has offered political asylum to julian assange under our laws with mr assange having exhausted all options of appeal the british authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to sweden we must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so hague confirmed following the guardian newspaper outcry over a foreign office note sanctioned by hague sent to the ecuadorian embassy—in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the diplomatic and consular premises act —the foreign secretary reaffirmed the uk remained committed to a diplomatic solution and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the ecuadorian embassy stating there is no threat here to storm an embassy the former ambassador craig murray warned that using the  act to raid the ecuadorian embassy would be in breach of the vienna convention of  russia warned britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles vienna convention on diplomatic relations and in particular the article  spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises which the government of ecuador invoked hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by parliament leader of the house of commons once hague had formally declared his intention not to seek reelection as mp for richmond at the forthcoming

membership of the national security council and played a lead role in reaching out to voters in the north of england in the run up to the general election in a surprise motion on his last day in the house of commons hague moved to make the election for speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent john bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a speaker of the house charles walker chairman of the procedure committee and responsible for speaker elections stated that he had written a report about such an idea years ago and despite speaking with hague and michael gove earlier that week neither had told him of any such move a visibly emotional walker conservative mp for broxbourne told the house i have been played for a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me walker received a standing ovation mainly from the labour benches for holding fast to values whilst the government

wednesday in parliament having difficulty to find fault during one particular exchange while responding to the queens speech of  hague attacked the prime ministers record in more than  years in politics he has betrayed every cause he believed in contradicted every statement he has made broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into there is a lifetime of uturns errors and sellouts all those honourable members who sit behind the prime minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer or whether they defend any point of principle know who has led them to that sorry state blair responded by criticising what he saw as hagues bandwagon politics  he started the fuel protest bandwagon then the floods bandwagon on defence it became armourplated then on air traffic control it became airborne yes the right honourable gentleman made a very witty funny speech but it summed up his leadership good jokes lousy judgment i am afraid that in the end if the right honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out and offer a vision for the countrys future not a vision that would take us backwards resignation on the morning of labours second consecutive landslide victory at the  general election hague stated we have not been able to persuade a majority or anything approaching a majority that we are yet the alternative government that they need at the  general election the conservative party gained just one parliamentary seat more than at the  general election following this defeat hague resigned as party leader backbenches on the backbenches he occasionally spoke in the house of commons on issues of the day between  and  he was the chairman of the international democrat union hagues profile and personal popularity rose thereafter among both conservative party members and the wider public following his spell as party leader he

he dropped several commitments and in effect took a salary cut of some £ on becoming shadow foreign secretary in  together with former prime minister john major former chancellor kenneth clarke and hagues successor iain duncan smith hague served for a time on the conservative leadership council which was set up by michael howard upon his election unopposed as leader of the conservative party in  at the  conservative leadership election he supported the eventual winner david cameron he is a member of conservative friends of israel a group which he joined when he was  return to the shadow cabinet after the  general election the conservative party leader michael howard apparently offered hague the post of shadow chancellor of the exchequer which he turned down citing that his business commitments would make it difficult for him to take on such a highprofile job on  december  david cameron was elected leader of the conservative party hague was offered and accepted the role of shadow foreign secretary and senior member of the shadow cabinet effectively serving as camerons deputy though not formally unlike previous deputy conservative leaders willie whitelaw peter lilley and michael ancram he had been widely tipped to return to the frontbench under either cameron or leadership contest runnerup david davis on  january  by camerons instructions hague travelled to brussels for talks to pull conservative party meps out of the european peoples party–european democrats group epped in the european parliament daily telegraph  january  further on  february  hague deputed during david camerons paternity leave at prime ministers questions pmqs this appearance gave rise to jokes at the expense of blair that all three parties that day were being led by standins with the liberal democrats represented by acting leader sir menzies campbell the labour party by the departing blair and the conservatives by hague hague again deputised for cameron for several sessions in

first appointment was hague as secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs he was also accorded the honorary title of first secretary of state in his first overseas visit as british foreign secretary hague met us secretary of state hillary clinton at washington in august  hague set out a valuesbased foreign policy stating that we cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience foreign policy is domestic policy written large the values we live by at home do not stop at our shores human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy but they are indivisible from it not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human hague further said that there will be no downgrading of human rights under this government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development he continued saying that indeed i intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work it is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience and neither is it in our interests however in march  hague was criticised by cardinal keith obrien for increasing financial aid to pakistan despite persecution of its christian minority to increase aid to the pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an antichristian foreign policy in september  hague told bbc radio s file on  investigation cyber spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the uk to countries with questionable human rights records that the uk had a strong export licence system the programme also obtained confirmation from the uks department for business innovation and skills that cyber surveillance products that break as opposed to create encryption do not require export licences in june  he continued to stand in for david cameron at pmqs when both the prime minister and deputy prime minister nick clegg were out of the country in january  hague visited new zealand in his capacity as secretary of state for commonwealth affairs holding talks with fellow commonwealth government ministers murray mccully and david shearer media reaction to fco appointment in early september  newspapers including the daily telegraph the independent and daily mail released stories about allegations surrounding hagues friendship with yearold christopher myers a history graduate from durham university whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser a spokesperson stated that any suggestion that the foreign secretarys relationship with chris myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded on  september  myers resigned from his appointment in light of that press speculation which prompted hague to issue a public statement wherein he confirmed that he had occasionally shared a hotel room with myers for reasons of frugality by upbringing but refuting the utterly false suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man a spokesperson for prime minister david cameron reported that he gave his full support over the media rumours figures from both within and without the conservative party criticised hague for his personal response to the stories with former conservative leadership candidate john redwood commenting that hague had shown poor judgement and the speakers wife laboursupporting sally bercow speculating that hague had been given duff pr advice whilst a parliamentary and ministerial colleague the conservative mp alan duncan described the media coverage as contemptible israel–palestinian conflict hague was criticised by israeli leaders after meeting with palestinians who demonstrated against israels barrier in the west bank he expressed solidarity with the idea of nonviolence and listened to the accounts of leftwing and palestinian activists israeli opposition leader tzipi livni condemned the statements and said the security barrier has saved lives and its construction was necessary the barrier has separated israel from palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in israel where citizens were exposed to terror every day  middle east protests hague meeting saudi defence minister salman of saudi arabia in london  april  in february  security forces in the bahrain dispersed thousands of antigovernment protesters at pearl square in the centre of the capital manama hague informed the house of commons that he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters at least three people died in the operation with hundreds more injured we are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred i have this morning spoken to the foreign minister of bahrain and hm ambassador spoke last night to the bahraini minister of the interior in both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression hague told sky news that the use of force by the libyan authorities during the  libyan civil war was dreadful and horrifying and called on the leader to respect peoples human rights a vicious crackdown led by special forces foreign mercenaries and muammar gaddafi loyalists was launched in the countrys second city benghazi which has been the focus of antiregime protests hague stated to dermot murnaghan on sky i think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation the united kingdom condemns what the libyan government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests and we look to other countries to do the same foreign secretary william hague meeting tunisian foreign affairs minister rafik abdessalem  following delays in extracting british citizens from libya a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight british diplomatssas arrested and no aircraft carriers or harriers to enforce a nofly zone he was accused by the labour opposition of losing his mojo in march  in march  hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north africa and the middle east will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region however following the row over whether libyan leader muammar gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces the foreign secretary stated that the libyan people must be free to determine their own future hague said it is not for us to choose the government of libya—that is for the libyan people themselves but they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on saturday when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat hague has warned that autocratic leaders including robert mugabe president of zimbabwe could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north africa said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including libya and egypt will have a greater historic significance than the  attacks on the us or the recent financial crisis he stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators but warned that they will inevitably face judgement for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy repressive african régimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community the foreign secretary said demands for freedom will spread and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed he added governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever they will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease and will find themselves on the wrong side of history hague and david cameron speaking to nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen at the london conference on libya  march  hague on his way to qatar summit in april  called for intensified sanctions on the libyan régime and for a clear statement that gaddafi must go we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians we do look to other countries to do the same if necessary over time we would like a continued increase in our natos capability to protect civilians in libya he added whether nato ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground hague said these air strikes are a response to movements of or attacks from régime forces so what happens will be dependent on that he said whether the americans could again be asked to step up their role would also depend on the circumstances he added hague speaking on the protests in syria said political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay it is thought as many as  people have been killed by security forces in the country today  april  making it the worst day for deaths since protests against president bashar alassad began over a month ago reported bbc news syria speaking on the syrian civil war in august  hague said of military intervention its not a remote possibility even if we were in favour of unbacked military action which we are not because theres no call from the arab league for intervention as in the case of libya there is no prospect of a legal morally sanctioned military intervention hague added that it was a frustrating situation and that the levers at the international communitys disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the assad government we want to see stronger international pressure all round of course to be effective that just cant be pressure from western nations that includes from arab nations and it includes from turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade president assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions he said i would also like to see a united nations security council resolution to condemn this violence to call for the release of political prisoners to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to he added on  february  hague recognised the syrian national council as a legitimate representative of the country hague also said bashar alassads government had forfeited the right to lead by miring itself in the blood of innocent people hague said today we must show that we will not abandon the syrian people in their darkest hour he added that those responsible for the murder of entire families the shelling of homes the execution of detainees the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account he said in march  hague ordered the evacuation of all british diplomats from syria and closed the uk embassy in damascus because of mounting security threats hague told parliament we have maintained an embassy in damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground he added we now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk” hague said that his decision “in no way reduces the uks commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the assad régime to end the violence he went on to say that “we will continue to work closely with other nations to coordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the syrian régime” hague meeting ahmad jarba president of the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces on  september  on  april  hague met  other nations at a friends of syria group conference in istanbul turkey hague said the issue could return to the united nations security council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail the government of president assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the unarab league envoy kofi annan but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition hague accused assad of stalling for time and warned that if the issue does return to the security council he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of russia and china who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down there isnt an unlimited period of time for this for the kofi annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the un security council—some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isnt progress made hague told the bbc he added that what is now being put to them is a plan from kofi annan supported by the whole united nations security council and this is an important point its supported by russia and by china as well as by the more obvious countries—the united states the united kingdom france the arab league and so on on  november  hague recognised the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate representative of the syrian people and a credible alternative to the current syrian government on  august  the british parliament refused to ratify the british governments plan to participate in military strikes against the syrian government in the wake of a chemicalweapons attack at ghouta hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over prime minister david camerons decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote after the vote hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the syrian government saying if it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that noone will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate syrias chemical weapons proposal of elected eu presidency hague carl bildt and radosław sikorski meeting vlad filat prime minister of moldova february  in june  hague dismissed tony blairs vision for an electedhead of the european union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further constitutional tinkering hague made clear his view after blair argued that a directlyelected president of europe representing almost m people from  countries would give the eu clear leadership and enormous authority in an interview with the times blair set out the agenda that he thought a directlyelected eu president should pursue although he conceded there was no chance of such a post being created at the present time asked about the former prime ministers call for further european integration and the creation of an electedpresident hague suggested that blair may have been thinking of the role for himself i cant think who he had in mind hague joked further adding on a serious note elected presidents are for countries the eu is not a country and its not going to become a country in my view now or ever in the future it is a group of countries working together taliban talks in june  hague said that britain helped initiate distasteful peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan hague made the comments while on a threeday tour of the country to meet president hamid karzai and visited british troops he told the sun newspaper that britain had led the way in persuading us president barack obamas administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict hague admitted that any deal might mean accepting distasteful things and could anger military veterans and relatives of the  british troops killed in afghanistan however he said he believed that britain as a whole was realistic and practical enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security he told the newspaper an eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security he added but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful in all these types of situations you do have to face up to some distasteful things the previous night us president barack obama told americans that the tide of war is receding as he announced plans to withdraw  us troops from afghanistan by september  comments on the euro in september  hague said that the euro is a burning building with no exits for some of the countries which adopted the currency hague first used the expression when he was conservative leader in —and said in an interview with the spectator he had been proved right it was folly to create this system it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly but its there and we have to deal with it he said i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it he further said adding i might take the analogy too far but the euro wasnt built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it iran in february  hague warned in a bbc interview about irans increasing willingness to contemplate terrorism around the world he cited the  iran assassination plot an attempt to assassinate adel aljubeir the saudi ambassador to the united states as well as alleged involvement in recent attacks in new delhi georgia and bangkok he said it showed the danger iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world hague spoke the commons on  february about the nuclear program of iran and said that if the tehran régime managed to construct a viable weapon its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too he accused iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad of pursuing confrontational policies and described the countrys enrichment of uranium in defiance of united nations security council resolutions as a crisis coming steadily down the track our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy it is important to emphasise to iran that all options are on the table hague told mps in march he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged claiming they were not free and fair he said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people hague said it has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair the régime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives the climate of fear created by the régimes crushing of opposition voices since  persists falkland islands  april  marked the th anniversary of the start of the  falklands war on  march before the lord mayor of londons banquet guests namely the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than  ambassadors including alicia castro argentinian ambassador hague said the uk was keen to deepen its relationship with latin america—and reiterated britains commitment to the falklands he said we are reversing britain’s decline in latin america where we are opening a new embassy in el salvador this determination to deepen our relations with latin america is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of selfdetermination of the people of the falkland islands tensions over the falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary in february hague said deployments of a british warship hms dauntless and the duke of cambridge to the falklands were entirely routine hague said that britain affirmed the falklanders selfdetermination and would seek to prevent argentina from raising the diplomatic temperature over the issue he further said the events are not so much celebrations as commemorations i think argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict since both countries will be doing that i dont think there is anything provocative about that turks and caicos islands hague set out her majestys government plans on  june  for the reintroduction of selfgovernment in the turks and caicos islands where direct rule of the governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous autonomous administration julian assange and right of asylum in august  hague declared that julian assange the wikileaks organisation founder would not be granted political asylum by the united kingdom hague declared the uks willingness to extradite assange to the swedish authorities who had requested his extradition thus swedish prosecutors unwilling to break diplomatic protocol have deferred from interrogating assange at the embassy of ecuador london hague confirmed the british governments position – that it is lawfully obliged to extradite julian assange were disappointed by the statement by ecuadors foreign minister today that ecuador has offered political asylum to julian assange under our laws with mr assange having exhausted all options of appeal the british authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to sweden we must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so hague confirmed following the guardian newspaper outcry over a foreign office note sanctioned by hague sent to the ecuadorian embassy—in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the diplomatic and consular premises act —the foreign secretary reaffirmed the uk remained committed to a diplomatic solution and played down any suggestion of a police raid of the ecuadorian embassy stating there is no threat here to storm an embassy the former ambassador craig murray warned that using the  act to raid the ecuadorian embassy would be in breach of the vienna convention of  russia warned britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles vienna convention on diplomatic relations and in particular the article  spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises which the government of ecuador invoked hague is the subject of a portrait in oil commissioned by parliament leader of the house of commons once hague had formally declared his intention not to seek reelection as mp for richmond at the forthcoming  general election he told cameron that he would be standing down as foreign secretary cameron instigated a cabinet reshuffle whereby hague became leader of the house of commons hague retained his membership of the national security council and played a lead role in reaching out to voters in the north of england in the run up to the general election in a surprise motion on his last day in the house of commons hague moved to make the election for speaker in the next parliament a secret ballot in what was seen as an effort to oust the incumbent john bercow for lacking the neutrality expected of a speaker of the house charles walker chairman of the procedure committee and responsible for speaker elections stated that he had written a report about such an idea years ago and despite speaking with hague and michael gove earlier that week neither had told him of any such move a visibly emotional walker conservative mp for broxbourne told the house i have been played for a fool and when i go home tonight i will look in the mirror and see an honourable fool looking back at me walker received a standing ovation mainly from the labour benches for holding fast to values whilst the government lost its parliamentary motion by  to  votes personal life william

election in june  where they gained  meps next to labours  hague hailed this success as a vindication of his opposition to the single european currency hagues authority was put in doubt with the promotion of michael portillo to the role of shadow chancellor in  indeed portillo had been widely tipped to be the partys next leader before dramatically losing his seat in parliament in the  general election only to regain his place there in a byelection win two years later within days portillo reversed conservative opposition to two of labours flagship policies the minimum wage and independence of the bank of england from then and until the  general election hagues supporters led by amanda platell fought an increasingly bitter battle with those of portillo platell has said that she advised hague to abandon the fresh start theme and to follow his instinctscitation needed this led to a number of further mistakes such as the claim that he used to drink  pints of beer a day when he was a teenager hagues reputation suffered further damage towards the end of his leadership with a  poll for the daily telegraph finding that  of voters considered him to be a bit of a wally and  of voters believed he would say almost anything to win votes foreign land speech at a party conference speech in march  hague said we have a government that has contempt for the views of the people it governs there is nothing that the british people can talk about that this labour government doesnt deride talk about europe and they call you extreme talk about tax and they call you greedy talk about crime and they call you reactionary talk about immigration and they call you racist talk about your nation and they call you little englanders  this government thinks britain would be all right if we had a different people i think britain would be all right if only we had a different government a conservative government that speaks with the voice of the british people a conservative government never embarrassed or ashamed of the british people a conservative government that trusts the people  this country must always offer sanctuary to those fleeing from injustice conservative governments always have and always will but its precisely those genuine refugees who are finding themselves elbowed aside former conservative deputy prime minister michael heseltine a prominent one nation conservative was critical of hagues allegation that britain was becoming a foreign land and confessed in newspaper interviews that he was uncertain as to whether he could support a hagueled conservative party skill in debate hagues critics were checked each wednesday by his performance at prime ministers questions during one particular exchange while responding to the queens speech of  hague attacked the prime ministers record in more than  years in politics he has betrayed every cause he believed in contradicted every statement he has made broken every promise he has given and breached every agreement that he has entered into there is a lifetime of uturns errors and sellouts all those hon members who sit behind the prime minister and wonder whether they stand for anything any longer or whether they defend any point of principle know who has led them to that sorry state blair responded by criticising what he saw as hagues bandwagon politics  he started the fuel protest bandwagon then the floods bandwagon on defence it became armourplated then on air traffic control it became airborneyes the right honourable gentleman made a very witty funny speech but it summed up his leadership good jokes lousy judgment i am afraid that in the end if the right honourable gentleman really aspires to stand at this despatch box he will have to get his policies sorted out and his party sorted out and offer a vision for the countrys future not a vision that would take us backwards resignation on the morning of labours second consecutive landslide victory in the  general election hague stated we have not been able to persuade a majority or anything approaching a majority that we are yet the alternative government that they need in the  election the conservative party had gained only

european peoples party–european democrats epped group in the european parliament daily telegraph  january  further on  february  hague stood in during david camerons paternity leave at prime ministers

affairs was prime minister david camerons first he was also appointed to the honorary position of first secretary of state in his first overseas visit as foreign secretary hague met with united states secretary of state hillary rodham clinton in washington dc in august  hague set out a values based foreign policy he said that we cannot have a foreign policy without a conscience foreign policy is domestic policy written large the values we live by at home do not stop at our shores human rights are not the only issue that informs the making of foreign policy but they are indivisible from it not least because the consequences of foreign policy failure are human hague said that there will be no downgrading of human rights under this government and no resiling from our commitments to aid and development he said he continued saying that indeed i intend to improve and strengthen our human rights work it is not in our character as a nation to have a foreign policy without a conscience and neither is it in our interests however in march  hague was criticised for increasing financial aid to pakistan despite persecution of its christian minority cardinal keith obrien stated to increase aid to the pakistan government when religious freedom is not upheld and those who speak up for religious freedom are gunned down is tantamount to an antichristian foreign policy in september  hague told bbc radio ’s file on  investigation cyber spies into the legality of domestic cyber surveillance and the export of this technology from the uk to countries with questionable human rights records that the uk had a strong export licence system the programme also obtained confirmation from the uks department for business innovation and skills that cyber surveillance products that break as

zealand where he had talks with foreign minister murray mccully and leader of the opposition david shearer israel–palestinian conflict hague was criticised by israeli leaders after meeting with palestinians who demonstrated against israels security barrier in the west bank he expressed solidarity with the idea of nonviolence and listened to the accounts of leftwing and palestinian activists israeli opposition leader tzipi livni condemned the statements and said the security barrier has saved lives and its construction was necessary the barrier has separated israel from palestinian cities and completely changed the reality in israel where citizens were exposed to terror every day  middle east protests in february  security forces in the bahrain dispersed thousands of antigovernment protesters at pearl square in the centre of the capital manama hague told the commons he had stressed the need for peaceful action in dealing with the protesters at least three people died in the operation with hundreds more injured we are greatly concerned about the deaths that have occurred i have this morning spoken to the foreign minister of bahrain and our ambassador spoke last night to the minister of the interior in both cases we stressed the need for peaceful action to address the concerns of protesters the importance of respect for the right to peaceful protest and for freedom of expression hague told sky news that the use of force by the libyan authorities during the  libyan civil war was dreadful and horrifying and called on the leader to respect peoples human rights a vicious crackdown led by special forces foreign mercenaries and muammar gaddafi loyalists was launched in the countrys second city benghazi which has been the focus of antiregime protests mr hague told sky news murnaghan programme i think we have to increase the international pressure and condemnation the united kingdom condemns what the libyan government has been doing and how they have responded to these protests and we look to other countries to do the same foreign secretary william hague meeting tunisian foreign affairs minister rafik abdessalem march  following delays in extracting british citizens from libya a disastrous helicopter attempt to contact the protesters ending with eight british diplomatssas arrested and no aircraft carriers or harriers to enforce a no fly zone he was accused of losing his mojo in march  in march  hague said in a speech to business leaders that the examples being set in north africa and the middle east will ultimately transform the relationship between governments and their populations in the region however following the row over whether libyan leader muammar gaddafi was being targeted by coalition forces the foreign secretary stated that the libyan people must be free to determine their own future hague said it is not for us to choose the government of libya — that is for the libyan people themselves but they have a far greater chance of making that choice now than they did on saturday when the opposition forces were on the verge of defeat hague has warned that autocratic leaders including president robert mugabe of zimbabwe could be shaken and even toppled by a wave of popular uprisings rippling out from north africa said that recent revolts against authoritarian leaders in countries including libya and egypt will have a greater historic significance than the  attacks on the us or the recent financial crisis he stopped short of threatening military intervention against other dictators but warned that they will inevitably face judgment for oppressing their people and suppressing democracy repressive african regimes will also face challenges from their populations and from the international community the foreign secretary said demands for freedom will spread and that undemocratic governments elsewhere should take heed he added governments that use violence to stop democratic development will not earn themselves respite forever they will pay an increasingly high price for actions which they can no longer hide from the world with ease and will find themselves on the wrong side of history hague on his way to qatar summit in april  called for intensified sanctions on the libyan government and for a clear statement that gaddafi must go we have sent more ground strike aircraft in order to protect civilians we do look to other countries to do the same if necessary over time we would like a continued increase in our natos capability to protect civilians in libya he added whether nato ratcheted up operations depended on what happened on the ground hague said these air strikes are a response to movements of or attacks from regime forces so what happens will be dependent on that he said whether the americans could again be asked to step up their role would also depend on the circumstances he added hague speaking on the protests in syria said political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay it is thought as many as  people have been killed by security forces in the country today  april  making it the worst day for deaths since protests against the president bashar alassad began over a month ago reports bbc news syria speaking on the  syrian uprisings in august  hague said of military intervention its not a remote possibility even if we were in favour of un backed military action which we are not because theres no call from the arab league for intervention as in the case of libya there is no prospect of a legal morally sanctioned military intervention hague added that it was a frustrating situation and that the levers at the international communitys disposal were severely limited but said countries had to concentrate on other ways of influencing the assad regime we want to see stronger international pressure all round of course to be effective that just cant be pressure from western nations that includes from arab nationsand it includes from turkey who has been very active in trying to persuade president assad to reform instead of embarking on these appalling actions he said i would also like to see a united nations security council resolution to condemn this violence to call for the release of political prisoners to call for legitimate grievances to be responded to he added on  february  hague recognised the syrian national council as a legitimate representative of the country hague also said bashar alassads regime had forfeited the right to lead by miring itself in the blood of innocent people hague said today we must show that we will not abandon the syrian people in their darkest hour he added that those responsible for the murder of entire families the shelling of homes the execution of detainees the cleansing of political opponents and the torture and rape of women and children must be held to account he said in march  hague ordered the evacuation of all british diplomats from syria and closed the uk embassy in damascus because of mounting security threats hague told parliament we have maintained an embassy in damascus despite the violence to help us communicate with all parties in syria and to provide insight into the situation on the ground he added we now judge that the deterioration of the security situation in damascus puts our embassy staff and premises at risk” hague said that his decision “in no way reduces the uks commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on the assad regime to end the violence he went on to say that “we will continue to work closely with other nations to coordinate diplomatic and economic pressure on the syrian regime” on  april  hague met  other nations at a friends of syria group conference in istanbul turkey hague said the issue could return to the united nations security council if current efforts to resolve the crisis fail the regime of president assad has said it accepts a peace plan by the unarab league envoy kofi annan but there has been little evidence that it is prepared to end its crackdown on the opposition hague accused assad of stalling for time and warned that if the issue does return to the security council he may no longer be able to rely on the backing of russia and china who blocked a previous resolution calling for him to stand down there isnt an unlimited period of time for this for the kofi annan process to work before many of the nations here want us to go back to the un security council — some of them will call for arming the opposition if there isnt progress made hague told the bbc he added that what is now being put to them is a plan from kofi annan supported by the whole united nations security council and this is an important point its supported by russia and by china as well as by the more obvious countries — the united states the united kingdom france the arab league and so on on  november  hague recognised the national coalition for syrian revolutionary and opposition forces as the sole legitimate representative of the syrian people and a credible alternative to the current syrian government on  august  the british parliament refused to support the british governments plan to participate in military strikes against the syrian regime in the wake of a chemicalweapons attack at ghouta hague denied suggestions that he had threatened to resign over prime minister david cameron’s decision to go straight to a parliamentary vote after the vote hague continued to urge other governments to take action against the syrian government saying if it is decided in the various parliaments of the world that noone will stand up to the use of chemical weapons and take any action about that that would be a very alarming moment in the affairs of the world ultimately a negotiated agreement was reached to eliminate syrias chemical weapons elected eu president hague carl bildt and radosław sikorski meeting vlad filat prime minister of moldova february  in june  hague dismissed tony blairs vision for an elected head of the european union by insisting that member states have more pressing priorities than further constitutional tinkering hague made clear his view after blair argued that a directly elected president of europe representing almost m people from  countries would give the eu clear leadership and enormous authority in an interview with the times blair set out the agenda that he thought a directly elected eu president should pursue although he conceded there was no chance of such a post being created at the present time asked about the former prime ministers call for further european integration and the creation of an elected president hague suggested that blair may have been thinking of the role for himself i cant think who he had in mind hague joked hague added elected presidents are for countries the eu is not a country and its not going to become a country in my view now or ever in the future it is a group of countries working together taliban talks in june  hague said that britain helped initiate distasteful peace talks with the taliban in afghanistan hague made the comments while on a threeday tour of the country to meet president hamid karzai and visited british troops he told the sun newspaper that britain had led the way in persuading president barack obamas administration that negotiation was the best potential solution to the conflict he admitted that any deal might mean accepting distasteful things and could anger military veterans and relatives of the  british troops killed in afghanistan however he said he believed that britain as a whole was realistic and practical enough to accept that ending fighting and starting talks was the best way to safeguard national security he told the newspaper an eventual settlement of these issues is the ultimate and most desirable way of safeguarding that national security he added but reconciliation with people who have been in a military conflict can be very distasteful in all these types of situations you do have to face up to some distasteful things the previous night president obama told americans that “the tide of war is receding” as he announced plans to withdraw  us troops from afghanistan by september  comments on the euro in september  hague said that the euro is a burning building with no exits for some of the countries which adopted the currency hague first used the expression when he was conservative leader in  – and said in an interview with the spectator he had been proved right it was folly to create this system it will be written about for centuries as a kind of historical monument to collective folly but its there and we have to deal with it he said i described the euro as a burning building with no exits and so it has proved for some of the countries in it he said he added i might take the analogy too far but the euro wasnt built with exits so it is very difficult to leave it iran in february  hague warned in a bbc interview about irans increasing willingness to contemplate terrorism around the world he cited an attempt to assassinate the saudi ambassador to the united states plus alleged involvement in recent attacks in new delhi georgia and bangkok he said it showed the danger iran is currently presenting to the peace of the world hague told the commons on  february that if the tehran regime managed to construct a viable weapon its neighbours would be forced to build their own nuclear warheads too he accused iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad of pursuing confrontational policies and described the countrys enrichment of uranium in defiance of united nations security council resolutions as a crisis coming steadily down the track our policy is that whilst we remain unswervingly committed to diplomacy it is important to emphasise to iran that all options are on the table hague told the mps in march he condemned the way parliamentary elections were staged claiming they were not free and fair he said the poll had been held against a backdrop of fear that meant the result would not reflect the will of the people hague said it has been clear for some time that these elections would not be free and fair the regime has presented the vote as a test of loyalty rather than an opportunity for people freely to choose their own representatives the climate of fear created by the regimes crushing of opposition voices since  persists falkland islands  april  marked the th anniversary of the start of the  falklands war on  march hague delivered a speech to the entire foreign diplomatic corps of more than  ambassadors at a whitetie dinner in the city of london alicia castro the argentinian ambassador was due to attend in the speech hague said the uk was keen to deepen its relationship with latin america – and reiterated britains commitment to the falklands he said we are reversing britain’s decline in latin america where we are opening a new embassy in el salvador this determination to deepen our relations with latin america is coupled with our steadfast commitment to the right of selfdetermination of the people of the falkland islands tensions over the falklands had risen in the weeks prior to the anniversary in february hague said deployments of a warship hms dauntless and the duke of cambridge to the falklands were entirely routine hague said that britain supported the islanders selfdetermination and would seek to prevent argentina from raising the diplomatic temperature on the issue he said the events are not so much celebrations as commemorations i think argentina will also be holding commemorations of those who died in the conflict since both countries will be doing that i dont think there is anything provocative about that turks and caicos islands hague set out his plans on  june  for the reintroduction of home rule in the turks and caicos islands where direct rule of the governor had been in place since the islands had been subject to corruption and maladministration under the previous local government julian assange and right of asylum in august  hague stated that julian assange from wikileaks organisation would not get political asylum from united kingdom hague declared his intentions to extradite assange and deliver him to swedish authorities swedish authorities refused to interrogate assange in the ecuadorian embassy in londoncitation needed hague stressed the british governments position — that it is lawfully obliged to extradite julian assange were disappointed by the statement by ecuadors foreign minister today that ecuador has offered political asylum to julian assange under our law with mr assange having exhausted all options of appeal the british authorities are under a binding obligation to extradite him to sweden we must carry out that obligation and of course we fully intend to do so he said following an outcry over a foreign office note sanctioned by hague that was sent to the ecuadorian embassy — in which it raised the possibility of the revocation of their diplomatic status under the diplomatic and consular premises act  — the foreign secretary said the uk remained committed to a diplomatic solution and played down suggestions that police might raid the ecuadorian embassy saying there is no threat here to storm an embassy the human rights activist and former ambassador craig murray warned that using the  act to raid the ecuadorian embassy would be a breach of the vienna convention of  russia warned britain against violating fundamental diplomatic principles vienna convention on diplomatic relations and in particular the article  spelling out the inviolability of diplomatic premises which the government of ecuador invoked  july  cabinet

whom he employed as a parliamentary special adviser a spokesperson stated that any suggestion that the foreign secretarys relationship with chris myers is anything other than a purely professional one is wholly inaccurate and unfounded on  september  myers resigned from his position in the light of the press allegations the media stories led hague to make a public statement in which he confirmed that he had occasionally shared a hotel room with myers but described as utterly false suggestions that he had ever been involved in a relationship with any man a spokesperson for the prime minister

yearold schoolboy with a pronounced northern accent captivated the media and impressed the conservative leader margaret thatcherhague attended the university of oxford was elected president of the oxford union debating society and obtained a firstclass honours degree in philosophy politics and economics after graduation he joined the shell oil co as a management trainee but a year later he was recruited by management consultants mckinsey and coin february  he was selected to contest a byelection in the “safe” conservative seat of richmond north yorkshire and within two years he had become
