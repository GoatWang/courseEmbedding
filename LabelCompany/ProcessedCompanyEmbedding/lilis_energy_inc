during april of  net boed   · expanded footprint in the delaware basin to over  net acres   · highly accretive farmin to lea county nm acreage   · significantly expanded liquidity with closing of up to  million in previously announced term loan financing availaiblity   · commenced trading on nyse mkt on may     · december  exit rate expected between  –  net boed   san antonio texas – may   – lilis energy inc nyse mkt llex an exploration and development company operating in the permian basin of west texas today announced a yeartodate operations and corporate update   avi mirman lilis’s chief executive officer commented “ continues on a rapid pace for lilis with goals exceeded both operationally and financially sequential average daily production jumped from  to  net barrels of oil equivalent per day  –  – an increase of about  in four and ahalf months we believe the wells we are drilling are among the best in the country on a boe per lateral foot basis as such we reaffirm our december exit rate production target of between  –  net boe per day   in addition to these strong operational results in april  we successfully completed term loan financings with up to  million of availability making us well positioned to execute on our  drilling and acreage acquisition plans in the delaware basin of the permian where we have already surpassed our initial acreage target of  net acres as of last month we acquired  gross  net acres in the first four months of the year and plan to expand our leasehold footprint judiciously and opportunistically during the remainder of the year our recently announced financings have enabled us to recapitalize and strengthen our balance sheet to support our continued growth said mr mirman   mr mirman added “initial production rates on the bison h and the grizzly h the first two wells of our delaware basin development program have yielded results above our original expectations management expects the remainder of our program to have similar results as the bison h and the grizzly h equally impressive is the stability of the production profiles of the bison h and the grizzly h which reached peak day production rates of  and  net boe per day respectively or  and  of their peak day rates cumulative net production from the bison h and the grizzly h through april   was  boe and  boe during the first  and  days of production respectively         year to date we have drilled four wells and completed three wells the third well the hippo is flowing back and the fourth the lion will be completed this week we plan to drill  gross  net wells in total this year given our cost performance to date we expect our total  drilling and completion capital spending will remain within our anticipated target of approximately  million while we anticipate that our drilling capital expenditures in  will exceed cash flow we expect to have sufficient access to capital to fund the balance through availability under our recent financings” continued mr mirman “looking ahead to  we anticipate adding a second rig to our development program early in the year a tworig program would allow us to spud approximately  gross  net wells assuming commodity price levels remain consistent we expect that the majority of our  delaware basin drilling program will be funded from internally generated cash flow”   financial update   the company has successfully tapped incremental sources of capital and expanded its liquidity since the beginning of this year most recently closing on up to  million of availability under term loan credit facilities including a second lien facility with  million drawn a first lien facility with  million drawn and access to up to an additional  million in delayeddraw term loans after giving effect to the repayment of  million in outstanding debt under the company’s first lien term loan the financings resulted in immediate proceeds of  million in cash for the company including available draws under the discretionary delayeddraw term loan which is accessible to fund certain leasing activity and acreage acquisitions as of may   the company would have cash on hand of approximately  million   also on may  the company’s common stock commenced trading on the nyse mkt where it continues to trade under the ticker llex   joe daches lilis’s chief financial officer stated “we have been able to achieve meaningful milestones since the beginning of the year in the company’s plan to create shareholder value we expect the incremental capital accessed by the company since march   will fully fund the approved  capital budget in addition management and the board believe that llex’s transition to the nyse mkt will increase its visibility to energy investors and trading liquidity   “in addition the recent financings have been accompanied by significant strides in simplifying the company’s balance sheet as part of our recent financing transactions we also redeemed  of the company’s conditionally redeemable preferred stock and converted  of the company’s series b preferred stock into common stock finally since january   holders of approximately  million warrants have exercised their right to receive common stock including the holders of  of ‘penny’ warrants” mr daches said   statement of operations for march     as reported in the company’s form q filed on friday may   lilis reported total revenue was approximately  million for the three months ended march   as compared to approximately  million for the three months ended march   representing an increase of approximately  million the higher revenues were primarily driven by an increase in production from the company’s delaware basin properties   production costs were approximately  million for the three months ended march   compared to approximately  million for the three months ended march   an increase of approximately  million production costs per boe decreased to  for the three months ended march   from  for the three months ended march   a decrease of  per boe or  the decrease in production costs per boe was primarily due to costs associated with the producing wells in the delaware basin which have significantly lower per unit operating costs than the dj basin   production taxes were approximately  million for the three months ended march   compared to approximately  million for the
