price but whos paying the bill  la times opinion oped oped the problem with the cost of college isnt the price but whos paying the bill off campus living costs desc according to zillow here are the median offcampus rents at the top  universities off campus living costs desc according to zillow here are the median offcampus rents at the top  universities andrew j policano over the next two months high school seniors will find out which colleges on their wish lists came through with acceptances but the tensions wont end when the admission letters arrive as paying the bill for a fouryear degree becomes a reality families will struggle to understand why higher education is so expensive and how they are going to afford itcomplaints that college fees are too high often reflect confusion over the difference between the cost of higher education and its price to students cost is a function of salaries for faculty and staff and the infrastructure expenses required to educate students price refers to tuition most people don’t realize it but the cost of educating a student has been restrained according to the higher education price index between  and  college costs rose annually at a rate only about threequarters of a percent higher than the consumer price index expenditure per student fell in many states overall at the university of california expenditure per student has fallen by more than  since  while tuition has risen uc proposes to raise it again for the  school year both actions are the consequence of decreasing state support for public higher education since  state support has fallen by more than  per student the cost of college has been restrained but someone still has to payaccording to the college board at fouryear public universities average annual instate tuition in  ranged from  to  with the national average at  it’s not an unreasonable charge consider this comparison according to the national assn of child care resource and referral agencies the average annual cost of day care in the us is  the tuition at public universities is about the same as a lowpriced daycare center whenever a state legislature decreases its support for higher education it is deciding that students should pay more these figures are also the published tuition amount which is akin to the sticker price on a car few pay the full freight the real price is the published tuition minus financial aid nearly twothirds of all college students receive financial aid average financial aid in  was  which would make the average net tuition at public universities  per year an even more reasonable price for a bachelor’s degreeso why all the controversy first room and board is expensive and can double the cost of attending college but whether you’re in college or not you will have living expenses there are choices many communities have local universities and students can live at home the high cost of living is outside a college’s control what’s really at issue in the collegecost controversy isn’t the price but who should pay for it students taxpayers or donors the protests over tuition increases have come about because of a major shift that is occurring in who pays whenever a state legislature decreases its support for higher education it is deciding that students should pay morebut not all students pay more most public universities have a “return to aid” policy that sets aside a percentage of tuition for financial aid for students who have college potential but can’t afford it at uc  of tuition dollars are used for aid as state support has waned universities including uc are redistributing tuition dollars from middle and upperincome to lowincome students at uc about  of undergraduates pay no tuition at all middleincome students are partially subsidized and most families with an annual income above  pay full tuition a recent study shows the effects of this universitydesigned redistribution as many as  of students who enrolled in the s at major public universities have seen their status improve moving from the bottom fifth of national income to the top threefifths access to education does lead to lowincome families finding a path out of poverty  society through significant cuts in public support is decreasing its prioritization of higher education rather than every taxpayer bearing the cost of making public higher education widely available wealthier families with collegeage children are subsidizing less fortunate families this scenario is neither equitable nor socially optimal the benefits of access are shared by society as a whole the costs should be shared as wellthere is another problem with the way we are making higher education accessible tuition is not rising by a large enough amount to replace the significant decreases in state support faculty program and infrastructure cuts are hurting the quality of educationpublic higher education in the us is not too expensive but the balance between cost price and redistribution is tenuous if legislatures — and voters — further lower their prioritization of higher education the system itself will be at risk not only will fewer lowincome students gain access to the advantages of a college education the quality of public higher education in the us which has long been recognized as the best such system in the world will surely erodeandrew j policano is a
