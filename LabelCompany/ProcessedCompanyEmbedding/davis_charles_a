description blue gardenia album for sale by charles davis was released mar   on the reade street label personnel charles davis tenor  baritone saxophones cedar walton piano peter washington bass joe farnsworth drums blue gardenia cd music contains a single disc with  songs recorded at systems two brooklyn new york on february   one of jazztimes top  releases from the new york timesthis was a good idea getting the year old saxophonist charles davis who has played in supporting roles with dinah washington steve lacy kenny dorham sun ra barry harris and others to make a lasting artifact as a bandleader blue gardenia album for sale for a tiny independent label reade street records it didnt take much more than setting him up with the new version of the pianist cedar waltons trio a crackling example of jazzs maturing mainstream blue gardenia cd music mr davis is best known for playing the baritone saxophone but for the first half of the album he plays tenor with a rather elegant understatement he balances melodic embellishment with the kind of magpies relationship to chords that coleman hawkins practiced running up and down them creating exotic intervals and the material is well chosen mr daviss own elegant blues waltz texas moon tunes by his friends frank lacy and john weston and a beautiful friendship and blue gardenia not the most widely covered standards in the world the rhythm section with mr walton the bassist peter washington and the drummer joe farnsworth plays impeccably finding perfect tempos and a beautifully even projection of sound if stores fail you can

for a diverse world davis charles a author description culture affects how we make disciples we often unconsciously bring our own cultural assumptions into ministry and mission not realizing that how we think and operate is not necessarily the best or only way to do things in todays global environment disciplemaking requires the cultural humility and flexibility to adapt between different cultural approaches charles davis former director of team provides a framework for missional disciplemaking across diverse cultural contexts he shows how we can recalibrate our ministry efforts like adjusting sound levels on a mixer board to accommodate different cultural assumptions with ontheground stories from a lifetime of mission experience davis navigates such tensions as knowledge and behavior individualism and collectivism and truth and works to help christian workers minister more effectively ministry teams church planters pastors and missionaries working interculturally at home or overseas can be part of gods movement of making disciples discover how the body of christ grows in the unity and diversity of the global church available formats paperback reference book  share  bulk
