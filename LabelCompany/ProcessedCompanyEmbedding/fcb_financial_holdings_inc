use of nongaap financial measures adjusted net income adjusted efficiency ratio adjusted returnonassets adjusted roa tangible book value and tangible book value per share are each nongaap financial measures used in this release a reconciliation to what we believe to be the most directly comparable gaap financial measures  net income in the case of adjusted net income and adjusted roa total net interest income total noninterest income and total noninterest expense in the case of adjusted efficiency ratio and total shareholders equity in the case of tangible book value and tangible book value per share  appears in tabular form at the end of this release the company believes each of adjusted net income adjusted efficiency ratio and adjusted roa is useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of certain noninterest items and provides additional perspective on the company’s performance over time and in comparison to the companys competitors neither adjusted net income nor adjusted roa should be viewed as a substitute for net income nor should adjusted efficiency ratio be viewed as a substitute for total net interest income total noninterest income and total noninterest expense the company believes that tangible book value and tangible book value per share are useful for both investors and management among other things as these are measures commonly used by financial institutions regulators and investors to measure the capital adequacy of financial institutions the company believes these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the companys capital over time and in comparison to its competitors these measures should not be viewed as a substitute for total stockholders equity these nongaap measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited they should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results and analyses of results reported under gaap and should be read in conjunction with the company’s financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap these nongaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have seen  annual returns on average

the acquisition of depository institutions through traditional open bank transactions and failed bank acquisitions with the fdic as well as through selective acquisitions of assets deposits and branches that we believe present attractive riskadjusted returns or provide a strategic benefit to our growth strategy the banking business is highly competitive and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts interest rates charged on loans other credit and service charges relating to loans the quality and scope of the services offered the convenience of banking facilities reputation in the community and in the case of loans to commercial borrowers relative lending limits we compete with commercial banks credit unions savings and loan associations mortgage banking firms consumer finance companies securities brokerage firms insurance companies money market funds and other mutual funds as well as superregional national and international financial institutions that operate offices within our market areas and beyond our largest banking competitors in our markets include bank of america bankatlantic bbt jpmorgan chase regions bank suntrust bank td bank and wells fargo we believe that the bank’s operation as a floridabased regional bank with a broad base of local customers as well as the local relationships of the bank’s senior management team and existing and future relationshiporiented lending officers enhances its ability to compete with those nonlocal financial institutions now operating in its market but no assurances can be given in this regard company description we are a bank holding company with one whollyowned

acquired assets including loan portfolios and other real estate owned or oreo that are covered under loss share arrangements with the fdic are referred to as “covered assets” our goal is to become a leading regional banking franchise that focuses on commercial business relationships and provides customers with a high level of service since our first acquisition in january  our operational focus has been on the stabilization of our deposit base the workout collection and sale of loan and real estate assets acquired in the acquisitions and positioning the company for future growth we intend to continue our acquisition strategy by selectively identifying acquiring and integrating depository institutions through traditional open bank acquisitions and failed bank acquisitions with the fdic in
