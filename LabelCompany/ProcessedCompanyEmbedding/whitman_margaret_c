political attack stating that allred is a jerry brown supporter brown allred and santillan all deny this crystal williams director of the american immigration lawyers association stated not only is

whitman would go on to land a number of high profile positions at big firms like disney stride rite ftd and hasbro in  she changed course a bit and landed in silicon valley as ceo of ebay still in its

purchase of skype the internet calling company for  billion later ebay took a  billion writedown on the purchase political ambitionsin  whitman a conservative republican announced her plans to run for governor of california in a state mired in an economic meltdown with hefty deficits to overcome whitman and her supporters believed california would benefit from her business background it helped that whitman who had served as an advisor to john mccain during his  presidential run was also willing to pump a record  million of her own cash into the campaign in all her race would end up costing some  million enough to win the republican nomination but not enough to defeat former california governor jerry brown in a tight race as a candidate whitman showed her inexperience on the campaign trail she revealed little about herself to voters and in the closing weeks of the general race tried to weather a series of political surprises and setbacks one incident of particular note involved the appearance of her former housekeeper who said she was fired following nine years of service after she revealed to whitman she was an illegal immigrant following her political loss whitman who is estimated to be worth more than  billion found that she was still in demand in the world of business in september  she was tapped to run computer giant hewlettpackard personal lifewhitman has two
