chief financial officer tj gallagher our chief operating officer david brown and our chief commercial officer michael miller i will now turn the call over to our president and ceo jack hellmann john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director thank you tom and welcome to gws earnings call for the first quarter of  as always we will start our call this morning with safety on slide number three you will see that gws same railroad safety index was  injuries for  manhours in the first quarter of  meanwhile our freightliner operations improved to a safety index of  in the first quarter a significant improvement over  and we are clearly headed in a positive direction now lets turn to financial results for the first quarter of  in slide number four our adjusted diluted eps were  which was roughly  better than the midpoint of our guidance on the top half of slide number four you will see that our total revenue was roughly  better than expected our adjusted operating income was around  better than expected and our adjusted operating ratio of  was about  basis points better than outlook as previously disclosed we recorded a significant charge related to our australian operations in the first quarter of  as our last remaining iron ore customer entered voluntary administration and we wrote off usd  million related to accounts receivable and a now idle maintenance facility the bottom half of slide number four highlights our first quarter performance versus guidance by geographic segment the big picture is that north america performed well thanks to improvements in our steel ports and railcar storage business as well as good pricing that tj will detail in a moment in addition australia continued to manage its costs well in a difficult economic environment meanwhile the ukeurope segment was below our expectations primarily due to further weakness in uk coal and softer performance in our continental european intermodal business with respect to uk coal our workforce restructuring is proceeding as planned and should be complete in the second quarter with respect to intermodal and continental europe we continue to reprice traffic and redeploy assets to more profitable lanes now lets turn to slide number five which is the highlevel comparison of q  versus q  for our north american operations overall our revenue was down  million or  primarily due to a  decline in coal revenue and a  decline in agricultural products revenue our steam coal traffic continued to suffer from low natural gas prices and high utility inventories due to the warm winter while agricultural products were affected by low global prices and the strong us dollar despite the revenue decline our north american adjusted operating income increased modestly in the first quarter and our adjusted operating ratio improved  basis points to  the chart on the bottom half of the slide presents the numbers in a slightly different way first isolating the impact of fuel then showing the margin loss on our lower carloads and finally highlighting the  million uplift from cost savings and the overall management of the north american business now lets turn to slide number six which is a comparison of q  versus q  for our australian operations at a high level including freightliner australia our revenue was down  and our adjusted operating income was down  due to weakness in the mining sector since there are few moving parts in australia i will try to make it clear first the adjusted numbers on the slide do not include our writeoff from the bankruptcy of arrium second if you look at the chart on the bottom of the slide you will see the largest impact on our first quarter with the roughly  million loss of operating income from lower manganese and iron ore shipments net of currency and the impact of freightliner australia we reported usd  million of adjusted operating income and an  operating ratio looking ahead australias operating income will be negatively impacted by the loss of the fixed payment for southern iron which is an arriumowned iron ore mine that is under care and maintenance southern iron generated roughly  million of revenue per quarter and fixed payments a loss which we expect to partially offset with further cost reductions as well as redeploying excess equipment to new business as previously disclosed we currently expect to continue serving arriums remaining iron ore business in the middleback range now lets turn to slide number seven which is a review of our ukeuropean operations recall that we owned freightliner for five business days in the first quarter of last year making the comparison not particularly meaningful a couple of comments first the first quarter has deep seasonality in the ukeurope segment due to weak aggregate shipments in the uk and poland and seasonally lower intermodal volumes in the first quarter of  our results were further affected by extremely low coal shipments in the uk for which many of the related costs are being taken out by the end of the second quarter finally our results in continental europe intermodal were lower than we expected primarily due to pricing discipline being imposed upon the business as we focus on more profitable lanes before we turn to slide number eight let me step back from the details of the quarter and comment on how the business environment feels overall by geographic segment north america seems steady overall but for every commodity that feels a bit better such as steel and aggregates others remain weak such as agriculture and steam coal in light of this unevenness we remain intensely focused on costs in australia its too early to call a bottom but commodity prices have certainly strengthened and our management team continues to effectively control their expenses in the ukeurope the restructuring of our uk coal business is on target and our outlook for the year is broadly unchanged now lets turn to slide number eight and our key priorities for the remainder of  our first priority remains the safety of our people and our railroads and we expect to make further progress at freightliner over the course of the year our second priority is to achieve our updated financial targets for  which now include the impact of the customer bankruptcy in australia we now expect an annual decline in adjusted diluted eps of  in  which is roughly  per share lower than our previous outlook meanwhile our outlook for  free cash flow is an increase of around  to  million prior to capital for new business investments please note that our earnings and free cash flow outlook do not include any onetime charges from the uk or australia finally in  we still expect to deleverage from  times net debt to ebitda to  times net debt to ebitda assuming no share purchase or acquisitions and investments our third priority is pursuing additional cost reductions across all three of our geographic segments while the significant volume contraction that we felt last year seems to have leveled out we are seeking further efficiencies our fourth priority is commercial growth where we continue to pursue significant new business in all of the countries in which we operate our fifth priority is an extension of the us short line tax credit that expires in  we currently have  cosponsors in the house and  in the senate so we are already onethird of the way to our majority target our sixth priority is acquisitions and investments as we use our global rail platform to identify the best opportunities for investment we are currently seeing interesting opportunities in several countries within gws footprint and i would now like to turn the call over to our chief financial officer tj gallagher timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer thanks jack and good morning everyone i will walk through the results in the quarter in a little greater detail followed by an updated outlook lets start with diluted eps on slide nine first quarter reported earnings in both  and  contain significant items that we highlight in the slide last year in the first quarter we closed the freightliner acquisition and incurred roughly  of acquisition related costs this year as a result of the australian customer bankruptcy we wrote off  million of assets and receivables or  per diluted share normalizing for these items as well as other minor restructuring costs adjusted diluted eps were  or  lower than  keep in mind that the short line tax credit was passed in the fourth quarter of  and was not included in first quarter results normalized for the short line tax credit q  adjusted diluted eps declined  or roughly  the simplest way to think about this decline is that one half is related to the deep seasonality of our ukeurope segment and one half was the impact of australian mine closures meanwhile north american income was flat yearoveryear as cost savings offset lower volumes primarily utility coal now moving to north america on slide  first quarter revenues in north america decreased  million or  with roughly  of the decline due to lower fuel surcharges the two most significant freight declines were steam coal and agricultural products coal traffic continues to be weak given low natural gas prices and first quarter volumes were further impacted by the mild winter weather ag traffic was lower and continues to be impacted by the strong dollar and low commodity prices our storage revenue however was higher as it typically increases when freight volumes decline as car owners use short lines to store surplus railcars lets go to slide  here we show a comparison of north american carloads by commodity the largest variance was coal which declined  carloads or  and represented  of the total q decline other commodities to highlight agricultural products which i mentioned earlier were down  carloads or  lumber and forest products traffic was up  carloads or  primarily due to stronger lumber traffic in the northeastern canada as well as strong wood ship traffic in the southeast us metals traffic increased  carloads or  primarily due to strong finished steel shipments while this increase is relatively small it is an inflection point for a commodity group that declined  last year our minerals and stone traffic was down approximately  carloads or  weaker salt traffic in the northeast due to the mild winter weather and lower frac sand shipments in the midwest was partially offset by stronger aggregates traffic in our costal and central regions moving to slide  and pricing north american average revenues per carload increased  excluding the impact of changes in the mix of commodities changes in fuel surcharges as well as currency average revenues per carload increased  note that we had changes in customer mix in the agricultural products auto and minerals and stone commodity categories that impacted average revenues excluding these customer mix changes the core pricing increase in the first quarter was approximately  moving to slide  and australia australia revenues declined  million or  primarily due to the weaker australian dollar and the australian mine closures in  partially offsetting was  million of revenues from freightliner australia now lets move to the ukeurope segment on slide  we show ukeurope results sequentially from the fourth quarter of  given the timing of the acquisition last year as jack noted q is the seasonally weakest quarter for our ukeurope segment and revenues sequentially declined across all major commodity groups in total revenues decreased sequentially  million or  now turning to slide  let me refer you to our earlier safe harbor statement that noted that these statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations these statements represent managements expectations regarding future results as of today april   and we do not undertake any obligation to update this information now before we get into the specifics of our updated outlook and guidance for q lets start with the big picture for each of our segments in north america after a  core pricing increase in the first quarter we now expect core pricing increases in the  to  range for the remainder of the year which will yield a full year average core pricing increase of around  consistent with our original guidance with respect to areas of strength and weakness coal is expected to be weaker than our original guidance and we now expect our coal revenues to decline yearoveryear by  million compared with our original guidance of down approximately  million we also expect our agricultural product shipments to be lower but the timing of ag shipments remains our biggest wildcard areas of strength include steel as well as higher freightrelated revenues such as storage and port switching we expect full year revenues and adjusted operating income to be consistent with our original guidance for north america noting that second half income is typically stronger than the first half given the seasonality of the business and the timing of winter in australia our remaining iron ore customer filed for the australian equivalent of bankruptcy in early april and as a result of this filing we will no longer receive the fixed revenue payments under the southern iron contract which amounts to about  million for the remaining three quarters of  however we â as jack noted we expect to continue to serve the customer and its other locations our full year expectation for australia adjusted operating income is approximately  million lower than our original guidance as new business and additional cost reductions are expected to partially offset the loss of southern iron revenue note that both iron ore and manganese prices are approximately  higher than at the beginning of the year these increases can only improve the outlook for certain of our customers now slide  and the ukeurope segment the restructuring of the coal business is on track and we expect the workforce restructuring to be complete by the end of the second quarter at an estimated cost of  million with respect to our intermodal business uk operations continue to perform broadly in line with expectations while the rationalization of our continental europe operations continues the continental intermodal business operated at a loss in the first quarter but we expect the business to move to profitability later in the year as unprofitable lanes are exited and the rolling stock surpluses are eliminated fullyear financial expectations for our ukeurope segment are consistent with our prior guidance as initial expense reductions are expected to offset the first quarter shortfall note that the intermodal business peaks fairly in the fourth quarter and the second half of the year will benefit from a completed coal restructuring now moving to guidance on slide  we provide here both our original guidance as well as our updated guidance to show a comparison we expect revenues of approximately  billion and an adjusted operating ratio around  we now expect our adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of  to  with diluted shares outstanding at  million free cash flow is expected to be approximately  million lower at  million or  million excluding new business investments the big picture is that our earnings expectations are about  lower than our prior guidance primarily due to the impact of the loss of the southern iron revenues and lower coal volumes which was partially offset by growth and additional cost reductions note that the updated guidance excludes the impact of severance and restructuring costs as well as the writedown in australia in the first quarter moving to the second quarter guidance on slide  we expect revenues of approximately  million and operating income of approximately  million net interest expense in the second quarter should be approximately  million and we expect da of approximately  million our effective tax rate should be around  and diluted shares should be  million the bottom line is we are expecting second quarter diluted eps in the range of  to  the simplest way to look at the second quarter guidance is segmentbysegment in north america we expect weaker coal and higher fuel price to offset the normal seasonal uplift in q in australia we expect operating income in q roughly equal to q due to a short term freight move that will offset the most of the southern iron revenue loss and in the ukeurope segment we expect a sequential improvement in all lines due to normal seasonality i will close with our balance sheet on slide  our net debt was  billion and our debt to adjusted ebitda was  times and with that i will open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator  our first question today comes from the line of allison landry representing credit suisse please go ahead allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc broker good morning thanks john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director good morning allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc broker i wanted to ask about the core pricing in north america the  in the first quarter was a slight stepup from q but tj i know you mentioned it it should slow to around  to  so just curious what should we read from that are you expecting the overall rail pricing environment to slow or is this more related to the timing of certain contracts timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer ill let michael miller our chief commercial officer provide some more color but the short answer to your question is there can be variation in any one quarter it doesnt make for the whole year our expectation is at  for the full year and are consistent that said fuel prices are low and there are certainly some commodities such as paper or lumber where rate increases will be more challenging while in other ones we may get more than  michael any other color michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america no i believe thats right allison yeah were just seeing a little more competition and obviously with low commodity prices in certain sectors we can help work with our customers on rates to try to move volume so i think those two things we feel like it may take a little bit of a small step back in pricing but if fuel changes or truck competition gets tighter then theres upside as well timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer so the bottom line at  for the full year thats consistent with our prior expectations allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay that makes sense and then in terms of the more positive outlook for metals do you think this is a broader signal that the industry itself is starting to recover or is it more reflective of your specific customer base i know in the past youve talked about serving some of the very efficient mini mills in the us so just wondering how we should be thinking about that john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director hey mike why not â michael do you want to talk to little bit about what we are seeing at the mini mills its really plant specific in terms of what were seeing and i wouldnt say that theres â while theres improvements the conviction isnt huge but michael you want to talk a little bit about what youre seeing by some segments within the metals and in the steel michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america sure allison i think it is to jacks point it is very mill specific and commodity specific inside the metal sector obviously theres a lot of automotive traffic so finished coil steel is going to be relatively strong there were some tariffs imposed on some certain commodities coming into the states so those commodities as well have done pretty good but theres other sectors that we serve like rebar for example is really struggling just due to global competition so to jacks point i dont think were seeing a â were looking for the sky to continue to be bright and blue and the sun out but the mills we serve are very competitive and the commodities that we traditionally handle in those mills with one or two small exceptions are commodities that are in high demand allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great thank you operator our next question today comes from the line of alex vecchio with morgan stanley please go ahead alexander vecchio  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning thanks for taking the questions i wanted to maybe touch on the north america carloads guidance it looks like youre expecting  to  declines in q and down  for the full year which implies kind of those declines moderate to low singledigits in the back half is that just really largely a function of the comparisons getting easier or are you kind of seeing signs of actual improving underlying fundamentals if you will and if the volumes dont end up kind of maybe panning out as you expect in the back half what else can you do on the cost side to kind of mitigate potential downside to margins timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer sure the quick answer about the carloads the changes in percentages are really its a function of the  comp where volumes fell throughout the year but really dipped off in the fourth quarter so just maintaining relative stable volumes in  will yield a better outlook by comparison for the second half now with respect to volumes being down  thats primarily â if you look yearoveryear thats three things thats coal thats ag and thats minerals and stone primarily salt on a fullyear basis we said it implies about down  the biggest difference between the  there and the  we had at the beginning of the year is the lower coal traffic thats really the difference john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director with respect to your other the second part of your question so in costs as i said on our priorities well weve got initiatives in place in all three of our geographies weve done â you can see it from the results particularly north america less obviously so elsewhere we have some major cost savings initiatives of which you felt some of the benefit in q in north america and which were executing upon elsewhere in addition to those were doing internal benchmarking now that the volumes had stabilized somewhat and are taking another look at where else we can be even more efficient and so were not stopping with what weve done and we think theres always things you can do to be smarter and more efficient and so weve got three discrete initiatives underway in each geography to see what else we can get out thats not in the outlook thats just what were doing alexander vecchio  morgan stanley  co llc okay that makes sense thats helpful okay and then i just wanted to follow up on ma can you maybe talk a little bit about where youre seeing maybe the most interesting opportunities geographically speaking there are some headlines out there about some assets in australia specifically in the coal area i dont know any comments on the extent to which that might be something youd be interested in pursuing one way or another or maybe not just some more color on the ma kind of a pipeline at this point john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director yeah i know â certain transactions make it into the newspaper and certain transactions dont so ill just speak broadly to the population set of opportunity whether its in the paper or not and there is a pretty substantial number of opportunities in every geography that we serve right now north america australia in particular but time will tell alexander vecchio  morgan stanley  co llc okay thanks for the color appreciate it john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director sure operator our next question comes from the line of scott group with wolfe research your line is open scott h group  wolfe research llc hey good morning guys john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director good morning timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer hey scott how are you scott h group  wolfe research llc good good jack just a followup on that so how does the experience with freightliner and their coal issues impact your willingness to buy future coal assets though and i realize coal assets can be different from place to place john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director well yeah i mean â yeah the first thing you think about is the geography of coal and which geography is there going to be no coal which looks like the uk is at the top of that list which we had assumed as well except we thought it would come a little late we would have said  not  but its looking more like  rather than  but that was factored into our thinking and australia â it depends on the geography of the coal and its heat content and its sulfur content and its cost coming out of the ground in terms of where it sits on the global competitiveness curve with respect to coal that we currently handle under contract in australia its pretty much to the extent you believe any coal is going to be burned in the world that some of the coal that we handle and so that part so you have to differentiate between the types of coal that exist in the world whatever your â the longterm view is theres coal consumption and coal as an energy source within the broader global economy so we factor all that into how we think about potential transactions and how we â at what level we might invest in them and what exposure we think is comfortable for â if any for a company with our size of balance sheet and well take that into account scott h group  wolfe research llc okay that makes sense so i think last quarter when we talked about ma and you were saying given where leverage is we may need to do it with a partner and we dont want to be issuing equity kind of where the stock is has anything changed on those lines of thinking just given the increase in the stock price or your views on deleveraging and how you think about ma john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director i would just say whats probably whats changed is the number of opportunities is greater now than it was the last time we talked on a global basis and so thats one variable thats changed with respect to us maintaining active dialogues with thirdparty capital as a potential source of financing depending on the specific transaction those dialogues are alive and well and so how we finance any given transactions can depend on a lot of things including valuation the deal structure and of course our leverage profile at that moment in time but weve got all our â id say the biggest change is that theres more stuff out there scott h group  wolfe research llc okay and just last thing if i can last time you talked about several major contracts you were bidding on any updates you can give us john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director well update on when we get them i think thats â ill leave it at that but there are active things that we are bidding on in every geography the â its â i mean theres interesting things happening in all parts of the world right now and i think well comment on them as we â as they unfold i mean the one thing tj alluded to i wouldnt read too much into it our outlook for the coming quarters probably â in australia is probably better than one would have expected and whats going on there is were moving a stockpile of product that had already been mined that â which is currently in administration now â and so thats what were benefiting from there thats not because the price of that commodity is up  its just because that was the right thing for the administrator to do with prices of some of those commodities now up  it will be interesting to see what does mines do going forward so its too early to make the call on that but were watching that with interest in australia scott h group  wolfe research llc okay that makes sense i just wanted to make sure we hadnt bid on the contracts and lost and now there â its not an opportunity anymore okay thank you for the time john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director no no no theres still â its still an interesting population set operator all right our next question will come from the line of chris wetherbee with citi please go ahead chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc broker hey great thanks good morning guys john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director good morning chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc broker want to just pick up on the comment that you just made and i know you said its early but given what weve seen in the move in the commodity prices just any sort of indications youre getting from customers that are a little bit more upbeat and maybe they were a few months ago im guessing maybe just at least from a mood perspective its better but anything sort of concrete you can think about john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director i wouldnt say much beyond â were moving a stockpile for a company thats in administration right now we also actually are starting up moves â i guess i can ill call it were starting up movements later this quarter of an iron ore deposit thats laced with copper and i think its got some gold in there too and that wouldnt have â that was probably going to move before the price of the ore was up  because of what its laced with rather than the absolute iron ore itself but there are â were quoting prices and signing contracts for things like this so those are two contracts that weve signed that are up and running and were still quoting stuff elsewhere so well see how it unfolds i mean its definitely â its less grim than its been for the last â my goodness where are we now were in april so now almost two years that weve been dealing with the house of cards collapsing and so were now actually seeing with this major bankruptcy having transpired you could sort of start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful and then just switching gears to ukeurope now that we have sort of a first quarter under our belts which we didnt before in terms of the typical seasonality or profitability i guess im just trying to get a better sense of how to think about that we obviously had an operating loss i think theres a lot of different factors going in there but absent coal and some of the pressures that are coming a lot sooner as youve articulated how should we think about sort of the typical seasonality of the ukeurope business particularly for the first quarter going forward john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director absolutely tj hit it timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer so without the coal which would have been a counterseasonal help in q really think about the years lowest in q peaking in q for typical intermodal driven business so thats going to peak early in the fourth quarter so as you march through the year q the lowest then q improving q the peak and then q falling back a little bit if you look back at our q and q last year youll see sort of the relative difference between those two quarters but thats the way to think about the seasonality john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director and in q youre certainly not going to be losing money in q looking ahead and theres two reasons why number one is that the coal business is being restructured and so all those costs are going to be out and that in its own right would throw the business straight into the black in addition to that we absorbed some losses in europe in the european intermodal business that we didnt anticipate absorbing in the first quarter because there were some traffic moves that we thought would take place at a profit we decided not to close the traffic because it didnt make economic sense and wed rather exit leased equipment and not serve those customers and do so at a loss but if were â if youre not making money on that business youre not operating that business so its a very simple fix so you can â those two variables that we focused on will mean while the seasonality pattern is exactly what tj described youre certainly not going to see a first quarter like that we wont allow it to happen chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful and one just quick followup on that point that intermodal piece is a little â lags into the second quarter from a loss of profitability i guess i just wanted to make sure i thought that was what i heard earlier in the call i just want to make sure thats right john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director youre moving to â youll probably be flat â youre probably going to be breakevenish in the second quarter and modestly profitable in the back half of the year chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc broker okay thats helpful john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director because youve got â weve got to shake some â i mean weve got leased â shortterm leased equipment that â where if it cant find a proper home you just get out of it and then you pick up â¬ million â¬ million or something like that and that goes straight to the bottom line chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc broker okay great thanks for that i appreciate it john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director yeah operator our next question comes from the line of rob salmon with deutsche bank please go ahead robert h salmon  deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning guys john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director good morning robert h salmon  deutsche bank securities inc with â piggybacking on scotts question a little bit earlier about the opportunity set that youre seeing from a bid activity given the declines youre seeing in your broader commodities im assuming a lot of those potential business wins you can service with existing trains but can you give us a sense of the potential capital investments of those opportunities you guys are seeking to win john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director well theres not a single answer to that theyre â embedded in your question was a few areas of new business development one of those areas is in the case of australia its redeploying excess equipment so that new business that youre putting online is simply using equipment that otherwise would be idle because of the collapse of the iron ore markets in australia so thats requiring zero incremental capital and thats why youre seeing the profits the sustained profits that are probably a little better than one would have expected with respect to â so thats kind of on the commodities side then with respect to new investments and new opportunities we didnt quantify that each of those would be discrete investments for acquisitions and were not going to quantify what those dollar amounts are but i can â what i can say is that there are both big and small opportunities in that pipeline in multiple geographies robert h salmon  deutsche bank securities inc can we think about just kind of the return on invested capital as being comparable to what weve seen in the past as we kind of try and back into a dollar invested standpoint john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director you should assume that if we deploy capital on a cash on cash basis we expect it to earn our cost to capital longterm robert h salmon  deutsche bank securities inc it makes sense okay so no change in philosophy there tj when i was looking at the q guidance the north american margin degradation sequentially from the first quarter to the second quarter seemed a little bit kind of contra seasonal to me can you kind of break out how much of thats coming from the uptick weve seen in terms of the fuel prices and the lag effect there versus kind of the mix headwinds you had noted on the call timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer yeah its really â its both of those things its the further decline in coal but its also fuel we expect fuel to be â i mean our fuel prices today are higher than they were  months ago and with respect to our fuel surcharge programs which as you saw q over q last year we were perfectly hedged we had no real operating income â impact to that  million loss of fuel surcharge but right now were in that zone of any movement down in fuel prices we benefit drops to bottom line but since were below the thresholds at which the fuel surcharge programs kick back in were going to be eating that fuel for a little bit and so thats really â thats whats going on q robert h salmon  deutsche bank securities inc and is there a rule of thumb we should be using in terms of that threshold in the fuel surcharge john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director yeah so right now the â we participate in a number of fuel surcharge programs with all the class s if you look at their strike prices â but all of the gw fuel surcharge programs are struck around the  on highway diesel and i think right now were about  robert h salmon  deutsche bank securities inc okay thanks so much for the time operator our next question comes from the line of justin long with stephens please go ahead justin long  stephens inc thank you and good morning john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director good morning justin long  stephens inc so to follow up on the north american pricing discussion i wanted to ask about truck competition have you seen any of your business move to truck yeartodate and is the risk of conversion something that youre factoring into guidance for north american rail volumes to be down  this year john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director so the answer to the second part of your question is yes we factored in that competition into the volume outlook but to give you some anecdotal texture michael do you want to talk about just more broadly probably paper is the best place to talk about it and different geographies of the country michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america yeah both paper and lumber when you look at it from a truck competition standpoint if youre following truck rates actually truck rates have actually slightly declined over the last  days to  days plus coupling that with low fuel prices theres a surplus supply out there so what we tried to do is be smart about our pricing and make sure were pricing to the market were actually working directly with our customers they realize that both fuel and driver capacity could change relatively fast so theyre not going to make large conversions to truck but there will be certain moves that they can converge shortterm that fit but were working both with our class s and our customers to make sure what were pricing to actually protects the volume we handle but there will be some leakage and in some cases well be able to participate in the upside when theyre looking to move traffic to other lanes the other factor weve got specifically with gw is one of our larger paper customers has made several acquisitions and theyre redoing their distribution patterns and some of those circles will get a little shorter so it makes rail really more competitive â less competitive but were working with them as well to find places to move more rail traffic timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer hey and justin just you made a comment about a  decline in carloads keep in mind that about   of that decline is coal and so really the rest of the traffic in north america is relatively flat justin long  stephens inc okay thats helpful and maybe as a followup to that north american rail volumes have been all over the place the last two years or three years weve recently been in an industrial recession and i think its really tough to gauge what a normal environment looks like as you think about the north american rail business or your business what do you feel is a reasonable longterm growth rate for volumes and what do you view as the key drivers to that growth timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer thats a great question john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director thats a great question the answer will be â ill tell you what well â why dont we â well take that aside and well give you â i mean the answers you got to look at each discrete commodity group and make a judgment by commodity group with discrete underlying assumptions related to that commodity group in terms of what your conclusion is going to be because its going to be a range i mean for example if youre looking at coal you probably need the forward curve on natural gas sitting in tandem with it in order to draw any meaningful conclusions but if youre going to draw a longterm trajectory on agricultural products youre going to have a multivariable regression that includes exchange rates and prices of various commodities that are embedded in it and juxtapose with the proportions that we handle ourselves so our pricing is inflation plus pricing and you can see that weve been achieving slightly better than that our volumes are truly a commodity specific story and it clearly feels like were down in a trough right now i mean weve been on a trajectory downwards so it actually feels okay when youre sitting where we are right now and all were doing is focusing on costs but in terms of projecting the line forward from here i think maybe well have to do that separately for you perhaps on our next call justin long  stephens inc okay thats fine i can appreciate the complexity of it but just wondering when you put it all together how you think about that formula john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director okay justin long  stephens inc all right i appreciate the time this morning timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer yeah absolutely thanks justin operator our next question comes from the line of bascome majors with susquehanna please go ahead bascome majors  susquehanna international group yeah thanks for the time this morning a couple on australia when you think about your remaining business in the middleback ranges with arrium you said thats about  million annualized whats your expectation for how that fares while theyre in administration it just seems like its pretty complicated and increasingly politicized situation im trying to get a sense for what we should watch for what you guys are watching for to kind of see any risk or opportunity there as this unfolds john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director yeah no i would just say that its a very politically visible situation its visible not just at the state level given that its transpiring in the second largest city in south australia but also at a national or commonwealth level in australia because its steel and by the way the history of that plant goes back to building naval vessels in world war ii and the population of the town is utterly dependent on both the steelworks and the iron ore business so that is why youve seen involvement including the prime minister thats why youve seen it find its way from the national press to the international press i think with the company in administration theres a great deal of political will to preserve the steelworks at some level and the commonwealth government for example has approved purchases of steel for federally owned entities basically accelerating capex plans that use steel as a sort of a government subsidy mechanism to ensure that outcome and i wouldnt be surprised if you saw more things like that on the steel side on the iron or side its all a question of money and whether the mines are in the money or not and whether in administration they become as efficient as they can be to have a longterm future supply in the global iron ore market in that geography youre very close to the water and so that in itself means that the cost of getting the product from the interior and onto the ship should be reasonably competitive in this case because its draft they have to have an intermediate barge move that undermines that a little bit but when youre approximate to the water that tends to be a plus there are believe it or not new deposits that have been discovered directly adjacent to the existing ones that are close to the surface so those have potential i think over time to become part of that mining equation but yeah youre right its in a fluid process its business as usual today our job is were integral to the supply chain its a very very complex operation particularly when you start handling molten steel remember were operating on a couple of gauges the track and were handling molten steel inside the steelworks so what we do is quite complex and so were in close cooperation with the customer and were working â were going to work with them to see what their path forward â a sustainable path forward might look like and obviously there is â that there is â or any range of possibilities of what its future might hold including a sale of that business to a new owner and then it will be dependent on what the new owners expectations are for the operations there and whether theyre having rights to other mineral deposits in other parts of the geography are also of interest to them so youre right i cant tell you to pay attention to any one particular thing i wouldnt say but its â thats clearly a vital national interest and all of their highest level state politicians and commonwealth politicians are well aware of the situation so i dont think there will be any shortage of information emanating from the australian press so i think ill leave it at that bascome majors  susquehanna international group thanks for the comprehensive answer there and well continue to watch just one more on the australian coal haulage business with glencore my understanding is that you guys do provide some service to them already i know you cant talk about any auction process or not thats going on now but could you tell us a little bit about if you are entrenched there in any way shape or form and does that give you some advantage versus some of the call it infrastructures funds or the railroads that might be interested john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director no i think you just said i cant ask you this question but im going to ask you anyway and by the way that was extremely well phrased i kind of like the first clause sets you up for the second clause as a disclaimer yeah we crew those trains and weve done it for a long time and this was part of freightliner australias business we handle a ton of coal there between  million tons and  million tons per year is historically whats been going on there its an integral part of the supply chain that comes out of the hunter valley we got a great team there weve done a terrific job of providing service and ill just leave it at that bascome majors  susquehanna international group thank you operator and we have a question from the line of matt troy with nomura please go ahead matt troy  nomura securities international inc yeah thanks i just wanted to ask with respect to australia what percentage on a dollar basis of the business remains under fixed revenue contracts where you may not be actually providing any service in light of the iron ore closures are we at zero now or is there still some little business left where youre getting paid as part of a contract but you may not be providing at least today haulage or service to that customer john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director i cant say â i have â risk of not â you cant â i cant speak specifically to a contract but let me speak on a global basis for our â for the kind of mining industry specifically matt troy  nomura securities international inc sure john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director there arent any mining contracts around the world for which were getting paid to do nothing that would be a unique situation matt troy  nomura securities international inc okay okay so thats been purged i guess my second question would be then in terms of margins youve historically talked about australia somewhere in the s sub north american with the european acquisition you talked about a  or so in the intermediate term given the restructuring and the headwinds you face is it time to maybe rethink what those margins can be does australia settle somewhere in the mids say does ukeurope look like something more like  or do you think that given the actions youre taking longer term we can kind of revert to those bogeys john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director yeah the ukeurope i wouldnt touch australia is very fluid because youve got a business thats kind of mids right now having been in the high s but after losing five major commodity customers its actually pretty good that you got to mids and one could argue that if you have the same commodity base youll probably be around  matt troy  nomura securities international inc right john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director and there are step function changes putting a timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer what the or or what the operating ratio is going to be is going to depend on how much revenue has flown over the track and if any one of â any single commodity project rebounds with the price of commodities increasing the operating ratio target is going to be materially different to â from where its settling right now just by virtue of the economics of our business and the fixed assets that we own so i couldnt even in good conscience talk about what that target might be for australia other than were trying to be as lean as we possibly can be with a dramatically shrunken business that dramatically shrunken business is a very good business even under as we talked on the last call under worstcase scenario youre going to look at probably  million to  million of ebitda maintenance capex of around  million and thats on the downside so youve got a really strong business and then from that base you will â we will seek a trajectory forward matt troy  nomura securities international inc got it okay thanks for the time john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john barnes with rbc capital markets please go ahead john barnes  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for taking the questions hey jack first in terms of the australian business do you have a feel for maybe what percent of your book of business down there is still at risk for having to go into some type of administrative situation or do you think youre past all of that john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director i think were past based on who â if you look at who we serve down there and their financial positions i think youre past that now john barnes  rbc capital markets llc okay are there any of the assets down there that you would potentially take a look at from an ma perspective i mean you bought your big australian rail line essentially out of a bankruptcy situation are there any other rail lines that could potentially go into some either administration conservatorship something like that that would make them more approachable john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director im sorry can you repeat that john barnes  rbc capital markets llc yeah just are there any of the rail lines that potentially could come up for sale in australia are any of those assets at risk for going into some type of administration or conservatorship there essentially youd be buying them out of a bankruptcy situation john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director yeah no i cant envision that no i cant envision that pattern per se i mean i think our exposure to administration is very specific to what we continue to serve in the middleback range and how that plays out john barnes  rbc capital markets llc okay all right all right that makes sense and in terms of your comment about the placing where you took maybe â weve seen a couple of other rails do this where they take in a select customer or commodity type and priced it a little bit different in order to make it more competitive or what have you i mean are there opportunities elsewhere within the commodity base to do the same thing or was this just a very oneoff situation that you had an opportunity to help or exploit or however you would term it or do you see more of those pricing opportunities out there timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer so are you talking about the first quarter results in north america john barnes  rbc capital markets llc yeah where you talked about a specific situation where you lowered price on a spot base or something are there other opportunities like that to exploit timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer michael can answer the question more fully but we negotiate with our customers casebycase situationbysituation productbyproduct lanebylane in order to maximize profitability which comes to pricing volume so its â those situations are going on daily sales and marketing team is out there doing that work michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america yeah tj i agree  our job is be as nimble as we can to the market and stay as close as we can to our customers timothy j gallagher  chief financial officer the thing to always keep in mind is as a percentage of the through rate the short line is a very very small piece of that and so how the â how rates affect volumes is more dependent on others than ourselves john barnes  rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah well i guess im asking from the perspective of coal for example reducing the rail rate on coal is not going to make it more competitive with natural gas so the question becomes why do it thats why im just trying to get a handle on why would you price to something but i get your point i mean the short line component of it is a very small component john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director okay its completely fact specific as tj said and you can assume were extremely hyper rational about how we assess the fact pattern of every given commodity and customer to maximize incremental income john barnes  rbc capital markets llc all right thanks for your time i appreciate it thomas d savage  treasurer  vice presidentcorporate development we got time for one more question operator well good our final question today will come from the line of scott group from wolfe research your line is open scott h group  wolfe research llc thanks a lot for the followup just real quick two things john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director sure scott h group  wolfe research llc what are your april north america volumes if you know them and then whats the fuel price youve assumed for the third quarter and fourth quarter michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america i thought youre going to ask me about the fuel prices for the second quarter scott h group  wolfe research llc ill take that too michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america yeah so we were around â our actual fuel price paid again which is around  q were assuming  this is overall for q â quarters two through four scott h group  wolfe research llc so  youre assuming two through four so if we see four â and you have risk up to  you said michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america no see theres two different basis here what we pay and then what â so to translate that on the highway diesel averaged about  i think in the first quarterish its right now closer to   so yeah theres probably another   on the onhighway diesel before a lot of the surcharges kicked in scott h group  wolfe research llc got it okay and then do you have april north america volumes michael o miller  chief commercial officernorth america tj john c hellmann  president chief executive officer  director we havent â well be giving our carloads here in the next â in the first week of may so i think we should probably â yeah we do we look at them weekly but i dont think therell be any big surprises in there theyre embedded in our outlook but well release those shortly scott h group  wolfe research llc okay all right thank you guys operator well did you have any closing remarks thomas d savage  treasurer  vice presidentcorporate development thank you very much for joining us on our q

today we have four speakers our president and ceo jack hellmann our chief financial officer tj gallagher our chief operating officer david brown and our chief commercial officer michael miller ill now turn the call over to our president and ceo jack hellmann john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc thank you tom and welcome to gws earnings call for the first quarter of  as always well start our call this morning with safety on slide number  youll see that gw completed the first quarter of  with an industryleading safety index of  injuries per  manhours weve made significant progress in enhancing the safety culture of freightliner and look forward to another strong year in safety in  now turning to slide number  overall i would say the first quarter of  was not a perfect start to the year but the trajectory of our business is positive on this slide youll see that we had multiple items impacting our quarterly results the first item was  million of corporate development expense much of which related to our unsuccessful bid for florida east coast railways fec is a great railroad serving an attractive market that we first bid on in  and was recently sold again in a competitive process fecs corporate headquarters is located a few miles from gws jacksonville operation center which would have enabled us to unlock considerable cost savings even with those synergies however our valuation was not competitive at fecs railroad operations excluding its regional trucking business effectively sold for around  times trailing ebitda based on publicly available information as a result we maintained our acquisition discipline and shifted our focus to other investment opportunities that we think will generate greater returns for our shareholders the second item impacting the first quarter  was  million of restructuring costs primarily related to ers in continental europe having reached agreement with the dutch and german works councils we have now closed two offices and expect to complete the business restructuring in the second quarter the third item that impacted the first quarter was a noncash marktomarket of an intercompany loan to australia and related crosscurrency swap which cost us  per share as tj will discuss in a moment this expense will eventually unwind to a cumulative  impact over the twoyear life of the swap now lets turn to the core business  was at the low end of our  same railroad carload growth of  while our adjusted operating ratio of  was  percentage points higher than expected the majority of that extra expense in north america was in the causalities and expense line item and was due to higherthannormal track washouts and derailments in the winter months we see these results as unusual with several small incidents across multiple geographies and not reflective of any trend since our track has never been in better condition in fact our fra reportable derailments have improved  over the past three years but the bottom line is that higher north american expense cost us around  per share in the first quarter in australia the first quarter results of the glencore rail acquisition were right on target our new partnership with macquarie is operating smoothly and our australian business overall is on a nice growth trajectory not only did a manganese mine in the northern territory restart shipments in march but we are also working on several other new business projects turning to the ukeurope operations our first quarter results were  per share below our expectations for two reasons first a customer bankruptcy in germany resulted in a  million receivables writeoff and our uk intermodal business had a higher operating expense on current intermodal routes stepping back from the details of the quarter for a moment id make three big picture observations first in north america our overall view of the economy is broadly unchanged in  we continued to see modest carload growth and we still see several new customer projects starting up later in the year although we are hopeful that we will see the us economy turn the corner this year we have not yet seen that in our shipments second in australia after nearly three years of navigating the collapse in global commodity prices and a resulting sharp decline in our shipments our financial outlook has been getting progressively more positive third in the ukeurope where we have consistently disappointed for two years now we think the second half of  will mark the inflection point for business that endured three consecutive shocks over the past two years the first shock was the collapse of the uk coal market which led to our complete restructuring of the uk heavyhaul business the second shock was the deterioration of the ers business in continental europe where we are discontinuing unprofitable train services and restructuring to its modestly profitable core the third shock has been the unprecedented changes in the global container shipping industry which has caused congestion across the uk ports and container supply chain as a result of megaships unloading significantly more containers as well as from new uk port calling schedules that have been established by the new shipping alliances as ill discuss on the next slides were well underway with operational and commercial responses to these market shifts which are being implemented now and we expect to take hold in the second half of  turning to slide number  we have summarized our progress in the ers restructuring in continental europe first you can see the measures that we completed in the first quarter and then you will see the final restructuring steps in the second quarter in essence we are in the process of completing our exit of the equipment leases associated with the business that we stopped operating which run at approximately  million per quarter once that is complete in the second half of  we will be left with a smaller sustainable core business on the continent that is focused on the deepsea intermodal sector turning now to slide number  wed like to provide a more detailed update on our uk intermodal business as many of you know the global container shipping industry has been going through unprecedented change and consolidation following a series of mergers and acquisitions the global shipping lines have been reconfigured into major new alliances for reference weve shown a snapshot of the new alliances on slide number  the important point is that new routes and uk ports of car being established and we expect this to stabilize during the month of may allowing us to adjust our operations to better align with the new container flows this means that certain port calls are being rotated among the major uk ports that we serve including felixstowe southampton and london gateway in addition new megaships continue to create port congestion since higher numbers of containers are being unloaded from each ship which is making our rail service less efficient for example scheduled intermodal services more frequently depart with excess capacity and missed containers may either go by road or by an extra train service in response to these market changes weve been implementing a series of commercial and operational measures that are also taking effect in may four of the changes include one new service plans to match new port calling patterns two lengthening trains and optimizing wagon configurations three conversion of spot traffic to guaranteed contract volumes and four increased pricing on the spot traffic moves the bottom line is that we have an outstanding uk intermodal franchise that is adapting to meet major market shifts while continuing to provide worldclass customer service having said that when a supply chain is reconfigured and is coupled with volume surges our traffic flows are unlikely to be smooth right away the acquisition of the pentalver container logistics business which has now been approved by the british competition authorities and then scheduled to close in early may provides a partial release valve pentalvers complementary services of container storage in the ports as well as its trucking capability should allow us to capture a portion of any lost container volumes as a result we expect pentalver to perform strongly for the remainder of  and ahead of our acquisition plan turning to slide number  our priorities are unchanged for  first we are focused on maintaining our worldclass safety performance second we have an intense focus on the turnaround in the ukeurope segment and are making good progress third we are working on significant new commercial development projects in each of our three geographic segments fourth we are focused on acquisition integration and i should note that our northeast region made excellent progress in the first quarter with the providence  worcester integration fifth we remain focused on us public policy under the new administration including tax reform the short line tax credit and infrastructure policy with respect to the short line tax credit we now have  cosponsors in the senate and  cosponsors in the house and finally we are actively evaluating acquisition and investment opportunities across our global footprint and now i would like to turn the call over to our cfo tj gallagher who will review the details of the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of  tj timothy j gallagher  genesee  wyoming inc thanks jack and good morning everyone turning to slide  and results our adjusted diluted eps were down  to put these results into context ive listed a series of key items in each of our operating segments that impacted earnings when comparing q  with q  in north america net fuel prices were up  million or about  per share yearoveryear and fuel prices continue to be under the threshold at which gws core fuel surcharge program kicks in also as jack mentioned earlier we had higherthannormal washout and derailment expense in the quarter for example we had roughly  million in expense from the flooding in california earlier this year in australia arrium filed bankruptcy in april  and therefore q  was the last quarter that included the southern iron fixed payment in our ukeurope segment the largest yearoveryear variance was uk intermodal which jack has already discussed and we also had the  from the receivable writeoff in germany last there is a noncash marktomarket expense on the crosscurrency swap we put in place to hedge the australian dollar intercompany loan that partially funded the glencore rail acquisition as a hedge on a floating rate intercompany loan the swap doesnt quality for hedge accounting and therefore noncash gains and losses flow through the pl keep in mind that since the exchange rate on the swap and the intercompany loan and maturity is set the noncash gains and losses over the life of the swap will net out to  all these items masked the profit contribution from stronger same railroad revenues which grew  million or  excluding currency now lets move to our operating segments starting with north america on slide  first quarter revenues increased  million or  excluding the providence  worcester same railroad revenues increased  million or  primarily due to stronger coal and agricultural products revenues now moving to the north american carloads on slide  same railroad traffic increased approximately  carloads or  the significant variances were in coal which was up over  carloads or  primarily due to higher steam coal shipments in our midwest region lumber and forest products was down  carloads or  primarily due to greater truck competition as well as lower export log traffic to asia our metallics ores traffic was down  carloads or  primarily due to a plant shutdown in july of last year minerals and stone traffic increased approximately  carloads or  primarily due to higher rock salt and clay traffic partially offset by lower aggregates traffic the rock salt traffic is higher due to a more typical  winter compared with the milder  winter our petroleum products traffic decreased roughly  carloads or  primarily due to lower ngl production and higher truck competition in our northeast region pulp and paper volumes decreased approximately  carloads or  primarily due to strong truck competition as well as a plant outage resulting from an explosion at a customer paper mill and last waste volumes increased approximately  carloads or  primarily due to a new customer contract now moving to slide  same railroad north american average revenues per carload increased  excluding the impact of changes in the mix of commodities changes in the fuel surcharges as well as currency average revenues per carload increased  in this quarter we had changes in customer mix within coal metals agricultural products and minerals and stone traffic that impacted average revenues per carload excluding these customer mix changes the core pricing increase in the first quarter was around  turning to australian operations on slide  recall that our results include  of the revenue and operating income of our australia business as we consolidate its results but our net income attributable to gw reflects only our  ownership interest in q australia revenues increased  million or  primarily due to glencore railrelated revenues also in the quarter we had  million of revenues from two reopened mines that partially offset a  million decrease due to the loss of the southern iron fixed payment now slide  ukeurope revenues declined  million or  primarily due to the weaker british pound partially offsetting were revenue increases in uk intermodal uk heavyhaul and in poland uk intermodal revenues were up  million as container volumes continued to be strong post brexit poland revenues increased  million with higher construction aggregates in agricultural products traffic in our uk heavyhaul business revenues increased  million primarily due to a new customer now lets turn to slide  and second quarter guidance let me refer you to our earlier safe harbor statement that noted that these statements are subject to a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations these statements represent managements expectations regarding future results as of today may   and we do not undertake any obligation to update this information also please note that the guidance includes roughly two months of revenue and income from the pentalver acquisition in the second quarter we expect revenues of approximately  million and operating income between  million and  million net interest expense should be approximately  million and we expect da of approximately  million our effective tax rate should be around  and diluted shares should be  million the bottom line is that we are expecting second quarter diluted eps of approximately  to  same railroad north american volumes are expected to be roughly flat in q compared with last year as we expect stronger agricultural products and minerals and stone traffic to offset weaker petroleum products metallic ores and pulp and paper traffic in australia the increase in same railroad carloads is primarily higher metallic ores traffic from the two reopened mines last ukeurope volumes are expected to decline between  and  the decline reflects lower uk intermodal traffic due to the later  easter holiday and fewer working days in the quarter than in q last year also contributing is the elimination of certain continental intermodal routes with the restructure of ers as well as lower uk coal volumes these declines are expected be partially offset by higher uk and poland aggregates traffic slide  provides a comparison of our original guidance from february to our updated q guidance as well as an update on the second half of  our updated guidance for q is about  lower at the midpoint than the  we provided in february relative to our original guidance we expect a slight decrease in north america a slight increase in australia and ukeurope to be approximately  lower primarily due to lower infrastructure services planned by network rail in the uk and the uk intermodal transition that jack discussed earlier for the second half of  that is both q and q our outlook is unchanged with again north america slightly weaker and australia slightly stronger in the ukeurope our outlook is unchanged and reflects the final restructure of ers the implementation of the uk intermodal initiative that jack described and the contribution from pentalver let me close with our balance sheet on slide  we ended the quarter with net debts total capitalization of  net adjusted debt to adjusted ebitda of  times and  million of capacity under our revolver as a reminder again our australia joint venture operations are now financed on a standalone basis nonrecourse to gw and the leverage metric we discussed is as calculated under the gw parent credit facility which funds and is secured by our north american and ukeurope operations and with that ill open up the call for questions questionandanswer session operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session of todays conference our first question will come from the line of chris wetherbee of citi please go ahead chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc hey great thanks and good morning guys john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc good morning chris chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc i wanted to talk a little bit about the uk intermodal business you guys highlighted some of the changes that are going on in that business and just wanted to get a sense of maybe how we can think about the progress towards adjusting your network and then leveraging pentalver to ultimately drive profitability here it seems almost like a highclass problem where youre going to have a lot of volume from some of these new megaships coming in but its going to be different than what weve seen before so how does that kind of play out over the course of the next couple of quarters and how is that captured in the guidance john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure well why dont we â we actually have two speakers on the line from london as well matt walsh who all of you know as well as adam cunliffe who runs the intermodal business for us and why dont i kick the call over to matt and he can give you a flavor for whats happening on the ground in the uk right now and adam can provide some chip shots as we go so matt do you want to talk about it a little bit matthew o walsh  genesee  wyoming inc yeah sure thanks jack and just to remind everyone sort of what we do over here i mean as jack said i mean we sort of have this great service product of multiple trains everyday running from each major port to inland terminal and doing this successfully means that we need to run fullyutilized trains in the most efficient way every day so as we face those congestion issues which weve been talking about here which are compounded by sort of this new shift in demand patterns and as well as much bigger container ships obviously there is as i think we called an unprecedented change in the market which we are adapting to and working hard to continue to offer the product that we do and what this really means is were working hard with the ports to reduce the congestion so that means that on days of very very high demand were making sure that they are loading the trains that they need to load and we dont have trains going out that arent fully utilized and it means that were running longer trains wherever we can and working with the ports and make sure that thats happening and of course keeping in mind that as these alliances shift ports then obviously we have to shift along with them and thats something thats finally coming to sort of stabilization or fruition starting in may as all those port hauls have finally been announced and it also means that we have to make sure that we have the right wagon size and the right place to match the shift in customer demand which is something else that were successfully working through here and then finally as jack said working with our customers to make sure that were converting in places where there is high demand and people need the service that we offer were converting people who have sort of been on more of a spot tariff basis to more contracted basis in places where people arent willing to commit to that then were looking to increase our tariff rate and the object of all of that is to really smooth up volatility that weve been experiencing to running sort of that optimized train and making sure were getting paid to do that and then when we look at pentalver pentalver offers sort of the longerterm storage at the port which really as we see is a nice counterbalance to some of that volatility offering customers who include both sort of the freightforwarders the shipping companies but also the end users within all this congestion a place to sort of â and i think we call it sort of an escape out as a place to store their containers while their ultimate destination is decided upon and thats both for the imports and for the exports and being able to offer them both is actually quite important and so its actually a very nice complimentary investment to what we have today i dont know adam would you add anything to that adam cunliffe  freightliner group ltd i dont theres much i can add to that but what i can say from the first quarter is that the current daily range we have can spread between something where we have a box swing on a daily basis because of the kind of assets utilization problems weve got whereby the megaships come in where we dont have enough capacity to serve them but the customer base is looking for the capacity at a higher level so for the very reason as jack and matt have now outlined having a service plan that allows us to offer something where they are longer trains on services where theres higher demand and converging spot contract which is something we are having a huge effort at the moment to actually address those inconsistencies in delivery is something were working on very hard chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc and just following up on â thats certainly helpful and following up on the question about the guidance it looks like you have i think one more quarter of headwind in there before this starts to normalize and i guess thats sort of driven by the fact that we have a scheduling changing in may and then sort of youre adjusting your operations is that the way we should think about that john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah what youre seeing is a mixture of operational changes as well as rate changes starting to bite in may you flow into the third quarter a good chunk of them will be fully implemented as the volumes are increasing and because from a seasonal standpoint q q is when we pick up and so youre starting to feel the normalized business in the back half of the year i think i mean to â you asked a question about guidance we left some cushion in there on things not going perfectly by not adjusting our outlook for pentalver because we think pentalver is going to do better and so this is our best estimate of the outlook as of today which gives us some cushion on the pentalver side because if things are flowing smoothing our parking lot is going to be full chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful and then just one followup on sort of acquisition in terms of time on the fecr at the beginning of the call just wanted to get a sense post that transaction how do you see the landscape particularly for deals of a degree of size like fecr was i mean are there other sort of interesting opportunities out there of size or maybe are we thinking about sort of smaller opportunities as you go forward just trying to get a sense of how the landscape looks now john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah i mean theres both we have an active pipeline of both acquisitions and investments across the global footprint that we think can generate good returns and some are bigger than others and that was obviously a big one and so when i said on our last call â i think the question was are you skewed towards any one geography i said north america but id also caveat it that i will be wrong in terms of whatever i say and i guess that was right in that regard but that skewing towards north america was derivative of our attention to fec but we still have stuff â we have an active pipeline thats going on in multiple geographies right now chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful thanks for the time appreciate it john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure operator our next question will come from the line of ken hoexter of merrill lynch please go ahead ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch look at the three major acquisitions at the same time given how quickly i guess coal and some of the uk business melted down how do you step back and look at that do you want to kind of step back and maybe focus on a region did business really just change that quickly and i guess if you bring it back to the us do you see underlying growth at the core assets i think jack you mentioned at the start youre not really seeing it in north america a bit of a contrast to some of the large rails maybe dig into that a little bit as well john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure ken i think the first part of your question you might have been on mute for i think you started talking and we didnt pick up the first part of it ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch yeah john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc but i think its related to the perspective on the uk acquisition ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch i think just doing three major â sorry it wasnt from my side but maybe doing the three major global ones at the same time how quickly coal and other business melted down in the uk do you kind of step back and say maybe we need to slow down that doing multiple at the same time and kind of focus and integrate or do you feel like it was just something that hey the business really changed that quickly john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc oh no i mean definitely not each acquisition is reviewed in gruesome detail and isolation and wed never be biting off things we didnt think we could handle so its the latter the business changed quickly but im pretty philosophical about it because its been painful for two years youve had shockaftershock in the uk two out of the three shocks we had anticipated in some shape or form in that the coal we expected to go away it just went away a lot more quickly so we hadnt ascribed that much value to the coal as part of the longterm franchise but weve had to navigate restructuring sooner than we expected as well as the overhang of some leases but that was expected with respect to the ers in continental europe we ascribed a little bit of value to it in the acquisition model thinking that there could be some upside option value of that franchise as we got into it we decided that that was incorrect cut your losses and move on and focus on the part of the business which is solid which is what were doing now and so really the only one of the bunch thats sort of â in terms of if you look out and say year three or year four of a longterm cash flow contribution of the business the only surprise one has been the â or the true surprise â i mean each of those events is obviously painful in its own right but its been the intermodal the changes in the intermodal markets that were working through right now i mean and the issue isnt one of volume the issue is one of getting new operating plans based on new container flows in conjunction with a restructuring of an industry which truly is unprecedented if you look at the container shipping industry but the fact of the matter is were wellpositioned as that market stabilizes to capture a significant share based on an outstanding service product and with pentalver we think that only enhances the franchise so i think youll look back on freightliner and i do expect it to be on or ahead of what we expected when we originally purchased it but obviously our timing was terrible but were getting it there and theres a lot of people working on chipping away at it now with respect to north america id say theres modest growth its truly a commoditybycommodity customerbycustomer outlook theres some modest growth in the business right now its flat to slightly increasing weve got some plants that are coming online later in the year whether its rebar in oklahoma or cement in dallas or ddgs and cement in south dakota or whatever â theres a bunch of other stuff coming online you can see these projects coming through the industrial development pipeline and kicking in in the back half of the year coal has been a little better than we expected thus far in the year and thats going to be â its now the peaking facility so the heat of the summer is going to dictate how that plays out over the course of the year i think weve been pretty cautious in our outlook for coal but maybe itll heat up in the midwest and well do a little better lets see what other things i mean paper weve been off a little bit in paper but for us in the paper commodity group half of the shortfall is an explosion at the plant which was out of service i dont know michael for what two three months something like that michael o miller  genesee  wyoming inc two months john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah two months we did have a chemicals plant close which is sort of a oneoff thing up in our northeast region which is affecting carloads as well but overall the economy feels okay but we havent seen any signs of sort of accelerating around the corner or anything like that theres lots of interesting dynamics afoot theres lumber tariffs being contemplated between the us and canada calculating its impact on us is pretty tricky for lack of a better answer id say its probably pretty neutral for us because well get a positive lift on the west coast of the united states from competing british columbian lumber but where were the receiving end of lumber for example in new england that may curtail shipments dropping down from canada but i can caveat that by saying that lumber has to come from somewhere and we may end up originating it in the southeastern united states so theres a lot of patterns that remain to play out in lumber any other commodities to talk about i think thats a good flavor for it but the economy feels okay ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch yeah john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc it feels okay ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch thats a good rundown thank you just one other followup i guess on australia do you have other mines coming back i guess do you get a heads up as theyre coming back to stage assets and prepare you talked about the mines coming out i just want to understand maybe the magnitude of what we could see as business returns john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah well some of its new mines coming up and some of it is â were bidding on projects in various geographies right now and so theres a lot of stuff in the hopper ill tell you ive never gone through a commodity cycle like this one so im not speaking with multiple decades of experience here i have been surprised at how quickly some of these mines have come back on you watch that â i mean its fairly obvious with benefit of hindsight you watch a commodity price jump up  and it puts the mine back in the money people suddenly start hustling and figuring out how to make it work even if theyve got it in care and maintenance and so ive been surprised at how quickly a couple of these mines have come back on but the ones that were looking at now i would say are less about new mines coming back on and more about new projects that were bidding on at existing mines that are actually operational today so its a slightly different dynamic than what youve seen so far ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch thats great insight john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah dave brown is on the line from australia i dont know â dave would you add anything to that david a brown  genesee  wyoming inc no i think youve covered it well jack i mean the particular manganese mine that you mentioned in your slide deck was really within a day window was mobilized with the assets we had available to restart that so we do have some excess capacity in our resources in australia and the australian team is very focused on being nimble as new opportunities present themselves to get them online quickly ken hoexter  bank of america merrill lynch great jack thank you thanks dave john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc youre welcome operator our next question will come from the line of allison landry of credit suisse please go ahead allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc good morning thanks with the management change at csx and the rapid network rationalization thats in motion have you had discussions with the company or do you see any opportunities to shortline any of csxs business and if opportunities do exist do you think you have a competitive advantage given the success you had with improving the operations of the west dme following the deal that you made with cp when hunter was at the helm john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc well i mean the short answer is â yeah i mean the rapid city pierre  eastern is a wonderful precedent in terms of the value of the shortline model because that was a transaction where it was a great deal for the cp it turned out to be a terrific deal for us its been good for the customers and its been good for the state and so that was one of the larger shortline deals that had happened in a long long time and by all accounts thats been a very very successful transaction for all parties concerned so its certainly good to have a precedent like that in terms of how one answers the other question its really a question for csx themselves i mean the way i think about it is their market capitalization has increased about i dont know  billion over a very short interval of time and the idea that youre going to unlock  billion of value from doing short lines is probably unlikely theres a lot of other things that are going to happen first with respect to the precision railroading and all the things that will make the network more fluid and generate more profits and free cash flow and then i think a natural out â as time progresses and they look at how the network is performing and where theres lower density lines then i think a logical secondary step might be in the world of short lines but im guessing its certainly not number one out of the shoot and ultimately its a question for the team at cfx allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay that was a helpful explanation and then my second question relates to the petrochemical opportunity in the southeast that basically should be coming online over the next few years and were starting to hear the class s talk a little bit more about it and it seems like from the producer angle that what were hearing is that looking at this much of its going to be exported but they sort of want to utilize any ports that they can to get the product to market so i was wondering how you think about your opportunity to be involved in that john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc michael do you want to answer that did you hear the question in its entirety michael michael o miller  genesee  wyoming inc i did i did allison i think our view of this is were working very closely with the plastics producers and clearly the key driver here is going to be empty boxes and ports that have balance we are looking at all the ports that we serve were working with the ports that we serve and were actually working with producers to come up with the supply chain solution that helps i dont think anybody has put flags in the ground yet clearly there are some solutions been developed around dallas for export boxes they are going back to the west coast theres certainly east of the east coast ports are looking at solutions and the gulf coast ports are going to be the closest to proximity all i can say is this we are out there working with the customers and the ports and as opportunity presents itself well be in a good position to develop a solution we know what levers that producers are looking for and were trying to make sure we have those available to them if they pick a port that we serve allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay and do you john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc michael do you want to talk a little bit about some of the plastics that we currently serve today or is coming online whether its in corpus or in the pw storage or just give some color on the plastics michael o miller  genesee  wyoming inc yeah i mean allison we do serve several of plastics facilities in the southwestern market and the gulf coast so we are close with those customers there is a new facility coming online at corpus where we serve some of that will be exports some of that will display some domestic production i mean we see it as a large growth opportunity how much we plan it will ultimately be as to where the products ultimately flow for export allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc right okay great overall the takeaway is that you see it as a pretty significant volume and revenue opportunity michael o miller  genesee  wyoming inc yeah clearly for the industry it could be a positive the ultimate question is going to be where does it flow to put into containers because the vast majority of whats being coming online is for export allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc right okay john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah its certainly a staggering size of opportunity in that industry and so as a business development target its certainly way up there on the priority list because of the magnitude of the â you know what the magnitude of the investment is not just this year but the coming year is that which is planned right now and were trying to figure out how to best position ourselves allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc excellent thank you so much operator our next question will come from the line of scott group with wolfe research please go ahead ivan yi  wolfe research llc good morning this is ivan yi on for scott group john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc morning ivan how are you ivan yi  wolfe research llc great first on ma given the  times ebitda multiple paid for florida east coast is the ma market simply becoming more competitive also does the valuation on this deal in any way change how you value your own asset in the market john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc so the first part of the question was does it impact how we think about valuation im sorry can you repeat timothy j gallagher  genesee  wyoming inc competition john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc competition yeah i mean the competition â for standalone competitive auctions theres typically â we wont always be successful what was unusual about this one was that we had tremendous synergies and from holding all other variables constant standpoint we should be a successful acquirer because of the magnitude of those synergies so yes and that evaluation on a standalone basis was surprising having said that weve been doing this for a long time and have seen cycles like this and our footprint is much wider now than it ever was historically and so we see across our global footprint opportunities where we think were uniquely positioned to be making investments that yield our typical return profile and in ways that wouldnt be open to a broader competitive auction process whether were providing operating acumen or whether youre in a geography where other peoples just arent theres ample places to deploy capital where you dont have to â were never going to compromise our investment criteria lets see what was the rest of the question did i cover most of it ivan yi  wolfe research llc yeah just wanted to specifically hone in on how does this deal impact the way you value your own assets john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc its not in terms of how we value the assets itll be how the market values our assets i mean its obviously â its pretty high valuation and so yeah in relative terms thats quite an arbitrage ivan yi  wolfe research llc great secondly on the regulatory side can we still get the shortline tax credit if we get broader tax reform meaning would any tax reform eliminate the tax credit john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc not necessarily i mean i think in a perfect world the broader tax reform would be tremendously beneficial to us and we would â so were eager to see some variation of some plans be implemented because were an assetintensive business most variations of those plans are highly favorable to companies that invest as we do domestically and then whether the â the short line tax credit it falls in the infrastructure bucket and so its guise may no longer be a tax credit it could be some other infrastructurerelated plan there are several scenarios where you have your cake and eat it too where youre beneficiary of the broader corporate tax reform and find some version of the shortline tax credit which is the publicprivate partnership which is in line with the current administrations thinking or some variance thereof that becomes a stimulus for infrastructure spending and lets us continue to do what weve always done in upgrading our railroads so i dont think theyre mutually exclusive ivan yi  wolfe research llc okay john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc from a policy standpoint well will certainly be â i can assure were looking at both most importantly its just to get something to happen ivan yi  wolfe research llc great thanks for the time john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure operator and our next question will come from the line of bascome majors of susquehanna please go ahead bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp yeah good morning just following up on the earlier question about how the class i outlooks maybe on the balance for north america sounded a little more constructive than what youve laid out i realize your commodity mix isnt terribly truck competitive with very little intermodal in it in the region but your length of haul is also considerably shorter than your class i partners is truck competition playing into this in any way i mean have you felt that in ways that you havent in previous years can you just kind of give us an update on where you sit versus truck and if that balance is changing at all john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah i mean ill kick it to michael in a second here the place weve been feeling truck recently has been and we have been for some time has been paper and its been derivative of low fuel prices and in certain geographies we felt it youve seen it flowing through our numbers for some time and so we are working extremely hard with our major paper customers to alter their perspective on the economics of rail and i wouldnt say â i mean i dont think of it in terms of length of haul per se relative to the class i were part of a continuous haul overall and so its a question of getting good through efficient routes at appropriate rates to stimulate some more modal shift back to rail because we think we can be doing better in paper than we have been doing and are focused on it so i dont know michael do you want to talk a little bit about paper or anywhere else you want to talk about truck competition michael o miller  genesee  wyoming inc yeah bascome i would say â i mean we do face truck competition in paper and lumber also in metals and i would say just because we dont have an intermodal portfolio doesnt mean we dont face truck competition and clearly that has been a little bit of a headwind for us i mean to put in perspective base truck rates in general havent changed in  years its all been fuelrelated so with low fuel prices it does create a significant competitor out there and we are working really closely with our customers to really understand whats being converted what we can convert back and actually probably the single biggest growth opportunity for us in north america is going to be modal shift back to the industrial products carload business so we are really focused on it clearly we think theres going to be opportunities as truck capacity gets a little tighter fuel prices go up we just have to stay very close work very closely with our customers and know what opportunities are there to convert from highway to rail bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp well i appreciate the comprehensive answer there and from a high level can you give us a perspective on where free cash flow outlook sits with a year relative to what you laid out in february timothy j gallagher  genesee  wyoming inc yeah sure bascome this is tj i believe our original free cash flow forecast was around  million with all the puts and takes weve talked about my best guess right now would be maybe a little lower  million so its still on the same zip code not materially different bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp thank you for the time john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc thank you operator our next question will come from the line of justin long of stephens please go ahead justin long  stephens inc thanks and good morning john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc morning how are you justin justin long  stephens inc im doing well thanks timothy j gallagher  genesee  wyoming inc hey justin justin long  stephens inc so wanted to ask first about the longerterm picture for the european segment given all the changes over the past couple of years that you walked through i guess first once the planned restructuring is complete what do you view as the annual run rate operating income for that business and then second how should we think about the longterm growth profile of this business off of that new base john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc matt do you want to sketch out just a broad picture in pounds and we havent really given that information so well speak to it very broadly but do you want to just give a schematic on that just speak to it in ebitda instead of ebit matthew o walsh  genesee  wyoming inc sure i mean i want to be â id probably look to chuck what we discussed what we have in our guidance here and maybe think about that on â with the second half of the year thinking that as a run rate business we talked about the uk and some of the projects that are undergoing there are some pretty significant infrastructure projects that were quite optimistic about one is hs which is a significant â its probably one of the largest infrastructure projects in the world where its constructing new highspeed rail line moving north from london up towards birmingham and then points north from there the expansion of the third runway at heathrow theres also some large powerenergy facilities being constructed which all point to sort of increased demand for aggregate which we would expect to play a significant part in so i think from the bulk side which youve heard us talk less about were actually quite optimistic about the growth of that over the next couple of years i mean it is difficult to put specific numbers around that but those are all quite positive on the intermodal side i think we should grow and i think the way we think about the business is that it grows sort of along with port growth and maritime container growth it typically has been gdpplus and thats how we think about that business so i would start with and im trying to be as helpful as possible here thinking about a more run rate for the second quarter here start for the second half of the year in terms of our guidance and thinking about that on a run rate basis and then with some good growth opportunity from that and then i think the addition of pentalver is a big benefit in terms of increasing our footprint and really falls into how we communicate our acquisition plan to the market which is we make an investment in an existing footprint and then grow through complementary acquisitions from there which i think is another good example of that and then should lead to opportunity for further investments so i think jack im probably most comfortable in answering it that away if thats okay john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc no no its good thats perfect matthew o walsh  genesee  wyoming inc im just looking at it on ebitda basis for the second half of the year i think what were guiding people to in the uk and europe is anywhere between  million to  million of ebitda on a run rate basis so i think thats probably how we see the business and then with sort of that upside coming from there so justin long  stephens inc okay great matt thats really helpful thanks for all that color and then maybe secondly on the second half guidance i was wondering what youre assuming for the change in same railroad volumes within north america and maybe within that number if you could talk about your outlook for coal and grains and so theyre two areas where the comps get quite a bit tougher in the back half timothy j gallagher  genesee  wyoming inc so our updated outlook for the full year north america the carloads are modestly positive so with respect to coal i mean thats the wild card right now its basically flat for the full year stronger first quarter in our guidance its flat for the full year but again depending on the summer and the weather well see how it goes agricultural products weve got tougher comps but again right now our outlook is up justin long  stephens inc okay great ill leave it at that i appreciate the time today john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc great thank you operator due to time constraints our last question will come from the line of amit mehrotra of deutsche bank please go ahead amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc hey thanks a lot for taking the questions i appreciate it john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc the first one is just a quick one its related to the cyclone in australia â or i guess the typhoon in australia john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc just wondering if that has had an impact in the second quarter just trying to understand what the disruption is there so maybe thats maybe depressing second quarter john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc no dave do you want to talk about the typhoon that hung on left before it got to us i assume thats the one youre talking david a brown  genesee  wyoming inc yeah sure it is yeah exactly cyclone debbie that actually affected queensland coal production and transport but most of it really came inland sort of  kilometers  kilometers north of brisbane it came inland and took a little bit of a left and then just dissipated so our biggest concern was downstream impacts in the interior which didnt materialize so it did not affect our coal business at all amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats great let me just ask one more kind of related to an earlier question about free cash flow just more sort of philosophical question id imagine that given the acquisitive nature of the company thats kind of the number i would imagine that the management team would be focused on so just beyond this year i mean just high level im not asking for guidance but im just trying to understand given the outlook for the earnings profile the pipeline of new deals what type of free cash flow per share growth over short of the midterm would you want to target and look back and say okay you know this is what we achieved and it was successful and then kind of related to that you guys have this valueadded parameter in your longterm incentive framework it just seems like its a proxy for return on invested capital if i read it correctly which is obviously great but it seems like it could also introduce the potential for maybe some underinvestment in the business or a potential for underinvestment in the business and maybe im reading that wrong but if you could just talk about that and help us understand john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure yeah i think your second question is a great one in terms of how one structures any kind of compensation framework because especially in an assetintensive industry when you slap evatype programs on their management there ultimately youve got to have complete trust in the quality of the people running the business that theyre not starving the assets and that theyre being invested in appropriately the best way to judge that by the way is what the trajectory is and the trend line is and current things like fra reportable derailments and the like which in our case have come down the last three years  and our assets have never been in better shape so thats ultimately a judgment call as to how good the management you have in place running each of those operations and whether theyre appropriately investing for the long term and we are and the reason that works within our framework is we sort of have a trust but verify ronald reagan trust but verify operation of the business whereby in addition to each of the regions having tremendous autonomy in terms of how they run their businesses and invest in their businesses we have a check of best practices and various metrics that we apply across the capital plans for each of our regions to ensure that were investing at appropriate levels and so thats a rigorous part of our budgeting process and it basically puts not just in addition to trusting that youve got great people running your business it puts another crosscheck on it making sure youre investing at levels that make good sense in the context of the  other regions that you operate because we can benchmark versus ourselves very easily in terms of how were doing internally for each of our  operating regions its a terrific question because its the biggest â thats the one you always got to keep your eye on and weve institutionalized processes whether they be safety or these budgeting checks to make sure that were always investing appropriately amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc can you address the free cash flow one john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc sure was that answer not good enough i thought it felt pretty good amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc no that was a great answer but i just had a couple of part questions john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc yeah no i mean my answer on free cash flow â you can see over the last couple of years if you look at our book earnings im going to talk in rough numbers off the top of my head but youve been looking at book earnings declines of right what  to   but weve been growing our free cash flow at about  per year in a tough environment free cash flow per share if you do the math on that and thats in a pretty down market and so my target â if were doing our job deploying capital well investing appropriately we should be growing at that longterm  to  free cash flow per share rate as our target i mean thats what our internal profile is for growth for the company its often expressed as a book eps number to your point youre right its a free cash flow number thats relevant and that is in terms of how we measure the management of the business and as you can see we managed through some pretty rough years over the last two three years and youve watched our free cash flow not only remained stable but actually sequentially increasing through a tough part of the cycle so i think the short answer to my question is that you think â i mean structurally holding tax policy constant holding other variable constant can we grow at that rate inclusive of the incremental free cash flow of acquisitions yes thats kind of where were at amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats super helpful thanks for taking my questions john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc absolutely yeah absolutely its a great question i appreciate it operator there are no further questions in queue at this time john c hellmann  genesee  wyoming inc great well thank you all for joining us on our first quarter call we look forward to speaking with you again soon take care operator ladies and gentlemen it does
