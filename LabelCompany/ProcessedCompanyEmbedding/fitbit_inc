history  reception  awards  privacy concerns  surveillance  see also  references  external links productsedit main article list of fitbit products the fitbit flex with the functioning unit out of the replaceable wristband alongside the activity trackers fitbit offers a website and mobile app for ios android and windows  mobile the trackers can be synced to smart devices via bluetooth or uploaded to a computer running windows or macos using the bluetooth usb dongle users have the ability to log their food activities and weight to track over time and can set daily and weekly goals for themselves for steps calories burned and consumed and distance walked calories in versus calories out is more accurately measured when app users keep their tracker on however the app can be used without a tracker to measure calories on a lifestyle app the app offers a community page where users can challenge themselves and compete against other users the social element anticipates an increase in motivation finding that users take an average of  more steps per day when they have friends on the app users can choose to share their progress pictures and achievement badges health effectsedit in those who are overweight or obese a  study indicates that the use of wearable technology combined with standard behavioral weight loss intervention results in less weight loss after two years of use when compared to usual weight loss interventions there was no evidence that the devices altered the amount that people exercised or their diet compared to control a  study found use of lifestyle apps demonstrate promising results in promoting healthy living in adults it is unclear whether these devices affect the amount of physical activity children engage in accuracyedit a small  study of eight fit band devices during a minute workouts that included  different activities found the bands were at best reasonably accurate with the fitbit zip and fitbit one scoring  and  error ratings respectively a small  study had participants wear multiple devices on their wrists and hips performing different walkingrunning speeds on a treadmill fitbit devices worn on the hip accurately measured steps taken within  step of  accuracy devices worn on the wrist however were off by an average of  steps per minute when measuring the number of calories burned fitbit devices worn on the hip underestimated by an average of  while devices worn on the wrist overestimated calories burned by  authors concluded that both the fitbit one and fitbit flex devices reliably measured step counts and energy expenditure with hipbased fitbit devices being more accurate than wristbased devices these measurements did not address the question of health effects recalledit fitbit working with the consumer protection safety commission recalled the fitbit force on february   because some users experienced allergic reactions to the materials used in the product on march   the consumer product safety commission cpsc made the recall official at that time it was revealed that there were  reports of skin irritation and  reports of blistering  the product is no longer for sale on fitbits website in april  a woman claimed her fitbit flex  malfunctioned and caught on fire causing seconddegree burns on her arm following an investigation fitbit is adamant the cause of the exploding tracker was due to external forces assuring their customers they are not aware of any other complaints and they can confidently wear their own fitbit with no concerns historyedit headquartered in san francisco california fitbit was founded on may   by james park ceo and eric friedman cto on may   fitbit announced it had filed for ipo with a nyse listing the ipo was filed for  million the companys stock began trading with the symbol fit on june   after fitbits stocks fell more than  in  ceo james park announced in october that the company was undergoing a major transformation from what he called a consumer electronics company to a digital healthcare company on december   fitbit officially announced that they acquired assets from pebble including key personnel as the company decided to stop producing wearable technology the acquisition excludes pebbles hardware products in january  fitbit acquired romaniabased smartwatch startup vector watch srl for  million and it also paid  million for pebble a smartwatch brand that started as a kickstarter campaign receptionedit dedicated fitbit retail stand stocked with different fitbit flex trackers awardsedit fitbit has won numerous awards including runnerup at techcrunch in  and ces  innovation honoree and best in the health  wellness category in  fitbit ranked  out of the  most innovative companies for that year privacy concernsedit to set up and use the hardware one has to create an account with fitbit and agree to data collection transfer and privacy rules starting in june  fitbit was criticized for its websites default activitysharing settings which made users manuallyentered physical activities available for public viewing all users had the option to make their physical activity information private but some users were unaware that the information was public by default one specific issue which technology blogs made fun of was that some users were including details about their sex lives in their daily exercise logs and this information was by default publicly available fitbit responded to criticism by making all such data private by default and requesting that search engines remove indexed user profile pages from their databases the companys devices have also been used in criminal investigations in one instance a rape claim against an unnamed intruder was turned around to a criminal charge for false reports based on data from the claimants fitbit surveillanceedit a fitbit played a role in solving a murder connie dabate was murdered by her husband richard dabate initially richard framed the situation telling police and law enforcement officials that an intruder had broken into their home and fatally shot his wife however connie’s fitbit tracker showed that she was at the gym at the time richard told police his wife was shot using connie’s fitbit and analyzing her movements analysts were able to create a timeline that proved richard had created a false story on march   kelly herron was using a public bathroom when a man who had been convicted of previous sex crimes attempted to rape herron herron fought her way out of the crime and the story became widely circulated because her fitbit had tracked her frantic movements during her escape on march   jeannine m risley fabricated a story in which an intruder appeared in her employer’s home she was staying at and raped her risley told police that a man had assaulted her around midnight police found a fitbit lying on the floor when they arrived at the scene prosecutors used the fitbit as evidence and data to determine what had occurred the fitbit revealed that risley was active throughout the night and the fitbit surveillance analysis demonstrated risley had not gone to bed like she stated to the police

fitbit inc nysefit the company notes “we believe our future success depends on our ability to develop new products and features that expand the versatility and performance of our existing platform and we plan to continue to invest significant resources to enhance performance functionality and convenience and style for our users” source via fitbit this is certainly very true but there’s a problem fit has failed miserably to execute on the vision the fact is that there has been a breakdown of the product development process and this should be downright scary for holders of fitbit stock wall street investors and short sellers have mercilessly pounded the shares over the past year fit stock is off about  since the peak the irony is that the company has poured substantial resources in its rd efforts from  to  spending spiked from  million to  million but as seen with the performance last year fit hasn’t put this money to effective use during the holiday quarter the company saw its revenues plunge a grueling  to  million and the number of devices sold went from  million to  million fit also reported its first net loss as a public company this came despite the fact that it launched four new devices but unfortunately they really did not show much improvement in functionality and innovation in the meantime there has been a rush of competition to the market just some of the fierce rivals include apple inc nasdaqaapl garmin ltd nasdaqgrmn samsung electronics otcmktsssnlf xiaomi and microsoft corporation nasdaqmsft there are also plenty of lowcost operators which rely on the pervasive android system from alphabet inc nasdaqgooglnasdaqgoog in light of all this is it any wonder that fitbit stock has gotten crushed of course not what now for fitbit stock for the most part the problems with product development are far from over according to a report from yahoo finance the fit smartwatch as well as the bluetooth headphones are expected to be delayed until the fall some of the issues include complications with the gps system and water resistance granted the engineering of small devices is no easy feat but let’s face it gps has been around for a long time so with

criticism by making all such data private by default and requesting that search engines remove indexed user profile pages from their databases the companys devices have also been used in criminal

broken into their home and fatally shot his wife however connie’s fitbit tracker showed that she was at the gym at the time richard told police his wife was shot using connie’s fitbit and analyzing her movements analysts were able to create a timeline that proved richard had created a false story on march   kelly herron was using a public bathroom when a man who had been convicted of previous sex crimes attempted to rape herron herron fought her way out of the crime and the story became widely circulated because her fitbit had tracked her frantic movements during her escape on march

a fitbit lying on the floor when they arrived at the scene prosecutors used the fitbit as evidence and data to determine what had occurred the fitbit revealed that risley was active throughout the

intended to offer affordable access to the fitbit ecosystem but the wearables market has changed a lot since  sam mattera tmfmattera dec   at am fitbit zip photo fitbit fitbit nysefit released two new fitness trackers in   the charge hr and the surge it continues to sell four older models as well the flex the charge the one and the zip priced between  and  all six of fitbits trackers wirelessly sync with its app and offer a variety of fitnessoriented features including step and sleep tracking when it comes to wearbles fitbit remains the market leader and for good reason almost all of these trackers have been wellreceived by critics and consumers alike but some fitbit products are better than others priced at just  the fitbit zip may look like a bargain but its the companys single worst product fitbits cheapest tracker is still overpricedgiven that its fitbits cheapest tracker its not surprising that the zip lacks many of the features found on the companys other models the zip cant track sleep or flights of stairs climbed like the one or the flex can it doesnt offer caller id like the charge and the charge hr do and it cant control the music playing on your mobile device or track your location with gps like the surge can so what exactly does the zip do not much in fact it does just one thing track the number of steps its wearer has taken admittedly using that measurement it can calculate your distance traveled and give a rough estimate of calories burned but for all practical purposes its simply a pedometer of course theres a crucial difference between a generic  pedometer and the fitbit zip  pedometers dont wirelessly integrate with the fitbit app that software integration simultaneously adds a level of complexity and convenience automatically tracking activity and offering insights and the ability to compete with friends that was enough when it made its debut early in  but the market for fitness wearables has come a long way since then consumers can get a similar experience from a device that costs about onequarter the price xiaomis mi band retails for around  yet offers more functionality than the zip including sleep tracking vibrating alarms and phone call notifications buyers miss out on fitbits software but they can make use of alternatives including google fit labeled one of the best fitness apps by the verge moving upmarketfitbit reports the number of devices it sells each quarter but doesnt break out the details for individual models still it seems unlikely that the zip is selling in massive quantities in the third quarter  of fitbits revenue came from its newer charge charge hr and surge models fitbits management has placed greater emphasis on this metric as it has sought to move upmarket the two trackers fitbit introduced in   the  fitbit surge and  charge hr  are the most expensive in the companys history fitbit has likely kept the zip around as a way to give consumers a cheap entry point into its ecosystem but even at  its too expensive fitbit remains the wearables leader but other firms are gaining market share according to research firm idc in the third quarter xiaomi  led by surging demand for its cheap mi band  captured  of the market a gain of over  on an annual basis if youre in the market for a fitbit and cant afford the higherend models youd be much better served with the charge flex or one theyre all a bit more expensive than the zip but the additional features are worth the higher price sam mattera has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in

like xiaomis  mi band its functionality also lies somewhere in between it cant run thirdparty apps or display most notifications but it does offer reliable step tracking sleep data and a heartrate monitor its not particularly stylish but given its slim profile it isnt conspicuous it connects to fitbits highly regarded app and syncs with virtually every sort of pc and mobile device available its battery lasts several days for these reasons reviewers have consistently recommended the charge hr over its competitors no heartrate band costs this little feels this small and connects to as good an

the most direct alternative it includes most of the same features and is priced about the same as the charge hr but excels in one aspect unlike the charge hr its waterproof still reviewers have continued to recommend the charge hr over garmins tracker reviewing the vivosmart hr pcmags timothy torres recommended that consumers get the garmin band if you need something waterproof but for

and surge accounted for  of fitbits revenue and research firm npd group reported that the charge hr was the bestselling fitness tracker in the us from april to september fitbit shares rose on monday
