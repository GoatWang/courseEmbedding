impression consistent entertainment atmosphere and product quality managing our internal finances and cash flow to enable upward capital growth strict control of all costs at all times without exception company summary the key elements of the nightclub’s concept are as follows entertainment and dance based themes – the company will focus on themes that have mass appeal distinctive design features – the nightclub will be characterised by the elaborate dance club situated in a spectator setting which comfortably accommodates  guests the area will also offer three private sky boxes which can be combined for use in a conference or private party setting this room is intended for special events and daily use the adjoining dining room and bar would present an inviting and relaxing atmosphere which displays a collection of musical and dance memorabilia a live dj will coordinate the events and entertain the patrons with music and games during music breaks and offtimes location location location – one of the major advantages that the nightclub will have over its competition will be its location in the new highprofile your town centre gaming – the nightclub will provide several interactive style video games and pool tables to provide for both additional entertainment and revenue quality food – all would be lost without special attention being paid to the level of food quality a simple menu offering foods similar to those found at a premier venue traditional ‘bar’ appetizers will be on hand for people craving nachos wings or quesadillas while they drink and enjoy themselves exceptional service – in order to reach and maintain a unique image of quality the nightclub will provide attentive and friendly service through a high ratio of service personnel to customers and will also invest in the training and supervision of its employees we estimate nearly one service staff member for every  guests  startup summary the company is seeking a loan for startup purposes for a new entertainment venue in waldport funds needed to accomplish goal referenced above will be xx million the applicant will require the entire xx million to finish project buildout we will utilise the anticipated loans in the amount of xx million to build out the approximate  square foot space and purchase equipment necessary for the startup of a new nightclub venue the following

staff for eight years he is currently in his fifth year in the automotive industry where he is a successful finance manager related where your business is located is super important services the emergence of the main street area of waldport represents a unique opportunity for a highenergy dancethemed venue the development’s central location demographics and lack of direct competition are major advantages to this project the proposed venue will provide a local solution to the lack of social atmosphere and live sports venues geared primarily toward the  age group in the waldport area and will help keep late night entertainment expenditures within the localised region the new venue will specialise in highenergy themes a quality video and gaming area and will offer beer wine and an array of liquors and mixed drinks in addition the venue will sell nonalcoholic beverages such as soft drinks juices and bottled water a “casual” food menu consisting mostly of appetizers and small entrees ranging in cost from six to nine dollars will also be available the initial hours of operation will be  pm to  am four nights a week the establishment will draw primarily from the waldport market while attracting guests from the area’s other surrounding cities and towns related free job description template download  market analysis summary the concept and management of the nightclub has been well received and has been offered key placement at the centre of waldport’s new first  main town centre development this commercial centre spans  acres and promises an immediate primary trade population of  people with a secondary population of  people the boulevard at the avenue average daily traffic counts are currently  and will increase to  by  following the boulevard’s connection northward to i in  at the centre of the complex will be a screen cinemark and imax theatre opening march  the centre’s planners having met the nightclub’s management and have reviewed the concept they have indicated that the nightclub is “exactly” what they were looking for and wish to place it directly in front of the theatre the annual projected traffic for what cinemark is calling their ‘flagship’ location is  million people which exceeds their current tinseltown location at the arena the nightclub will be a  square foot unit which will also house the company’s corporate business office the dance club and bar will accommodate  people with waldport’s rapidly growing population the variety of the nightclub from across the country would create mass appeal for all of the nightclub’s customers the store will be equipped with stateoftheart audio and video systems like none other found in your city it will serve the need for a true nightclub in waldport the general appearance will be clean open and pleasing to the customer the demographics are favourable with minimal competition from other dancethemed venues and bars related how to create a marketing strategy  market segmentation we see the nightclub as appealing to three major market segments fortunately the long late night hours of operation help the nightclub lend itself to multiple segment appeal our market segmentation scheme allows some room for estimates and nonspecific definitions childless young professionals – due to our proximity to the imax and cinemark theatres we must appeal to single adults and young couples whether it is a group of friends or a couple out to see a movie together these people need a place to eatdrink either before andor after their movie these customers will range in age from  to  the nightclub will appeal to this category by switching the tempo and entertainment to be more appealing to adults as it gets later into the evening we also anticipate a  annual growth rate in tandem with the growth rate of waldport and through increased popularity college students – by creating an environment that is appealing to college students we secure a natural progression between the high school student and the young professional through word of mouth the nightclub expects realise an increase of five percent annually from this segment tourists and business travelers – more and more business and travelers and tourists are finding themselves in waldport every year as is made evident by the increased demand and subsequent expansion of the local airport we plan to reach these people through direct marketing to local hotel patrons we anticipate a  annual growth rate in this segment as our relationships grow with the local hotels so too will the word of mouth recommendations from the hotel staff as well as the patronizing of our restaurant by their families our future plan is to publish a simple website in order to create awareness to any traveler who wants to take an advanced look at the club before their visit  target market segment strategy our strategy is based on serving our niche markets exceptionally well the nightclub enthusiast the tourist and business traveler the local nightclub crowd the local service industry as well as groups going out together can all enjoy the nightclub experience the marketing strategy is essential to the main strategy emphasise exceptional service create awareness of the nightclub’s unique features focus on our target markets we must charge appropriately for the highend highquality service and food that we offer our revenue structure has to match our cost structure so the wages we pay and the training we provide to assure superior quality and service must be balanced by the fees we charge part of the superior experience we offer is the simplicity o the menu items while being unique they are relatively inexpensive and easy to prepare while a premium is appropriate for the experience the pricing has to be balanced in accordance with what we are serving all menu items will be moderately priced we expect an average guest expenditure of  for beverages and  for the percentage of our guests who choose to take advantage of our food menu our target customer spends more than the industry average for moderately priced establishments this is due to our creating an atmosphere that encourages longer stays and more spending while still allowing adequate table turns due to extended hours of appeal  service business analysis high energy and dance themed venues have significantly impacted cities from coast to coast in the nineties los angeles’ hollywood new york’s times square and seattle’s pioneer square are just a few examples entrancing their audiences with highpowered lights sound music and interactive entertainment these venues are still one of the highest cash flow businesses in the world our localised studies have shown that the average person will spend three to four hours per weekend in this type of an environment and will spend an average of twenty to fifty dollars in that time frame as we approach the new millennium this trend shows no signs of declining the typical venue of our style is open from  pm to  am and within this time frame the venue can achieve gross revenues anywhere from  to  nightly the primary sources of revenue in a venue of this type are high volume traffic coupled with comparably nominal spending in addition to alcohol revenues we will also generate substantial revenues from food sales that can typically range from seven to ten dollars per person and admission fees that range between five and ten dollars per admit entertainment venues in the late ’s and ’s focused on highenergy light and sound multiple source video screens and participative events this relatively simple concept is still quite popular today however these concepts have greatly evolved with society in recent years this industry has become more sophisticated with the availability of new technology larger metropolitan areas have taken this technology to new heights with sound lighting video and interactive designs that create an exciting and memorable experience fortunately no one in your state area has been a pioneer in this specific segment of the industry as of the date of this report additionally the nightclub and bar industry is shifting towards a more entertainmentoriented concept guests of these venues are not only offered a dynamic place to gather and mingle but also a place to participate in the entertainment through interactive contests theme nights and other events we intend to heavily utilise entertainmentoriented marketing in an effort to withstand the perpetual shift in trends and cater to as large a client base as possible nightclubs and other drinking establishments rely heavily on their primary suppliers the primary suppliers are the various beverage distributors that provide the establishment with both alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages the alcoholic beverages beer wine and liquor are the primary sources of income in this industry other beverage suppliers also play a crucial role by providing nonalcoholic beverages these are either served alone or mixed with alcohol in the area all major brands of alcoholic beverages are available in addition to several regional brands of beer initial research shows that the major distributors in the market have a high rating in both product availability and delivery  main competitors the nightclub competition lies mainly with other casual facilities and less with conventional and chain entertainment establishments we need to effectively compete with the widely held idea that you can’t get good service anymore while maintaining the idea that being out can be a lot of fun our polling has indicated that consumers think of atmosphere price and quality respectively additionally price was frequently mentioned by pointing out that if the former concerns are present then they are willing to pay more for the experience our review of the market concludes that there are four entertainment venues that can be considered direct competition to the proposed new venue we do realise that the proposed venue will also compete indirectly for every entertainment dollar spent in the waldport area related free competitor analysis example the main competitors of the nightclub will be club ahours of operation  pm am wednesday through saturdaycapacity  wednesday college night  beers this nightclub appeals to a college crowd seeking cheap drinks the club is known for being dingy and dirty bar bhours of operation  am  am monday through sundaycapacity  thursday collegeladies nights this club appeals to  year olds pool and video games are central focus dancing is pushed to the back of the club grill chours of operation  pm am wednesday through saturdaycapacity  this club’s target customer is  to  years old  middle class or above this club is known for its older dressed up crowd and cramped space club dhours of operation  am am monday through sundaycapacity  this club’s target customer is  to  years old this club is known for live jazz and blues entertainment and their draught beers  business participants the nightclub will be part of the restaurant and bar industry which includes several kinds of businesses locally operated bars and nightclubs – this genre usually appeals to the local neighbourhood clientele this same client base dictates that the average price structure be drastically scaled down in order to create “regulars” nightclub entertainment complexes – this type of complex represents the concept we will most closely compete with they are typically placed in high traffic locations and are normally treated as destination entertainment an admission charge is usually in place and the associated price structure is also most like our proposed structure thankfully there is not an abundance if this type of entertainment within our region conventional dining – primarily owned by large national chains usually less than  square feet focused on serving good quality food in a reasonable amount of time in a dining room setting the service and food quality are superior to that of a fast food establishment people go there to eat and leave when they’re done eating since there’s rarely a reason to stay formal dining – similar to conventional dining yet offering a higher quality of food and service for the added expense as with the conventional dining facilities there is little interaction and when people are done eating they leave casual dining – commonly building upon conventional dining with the addition of a bar playing of music and sporting events on numerous televisions some establishments offer their own brand of beer made on the premises the food quality and service are at best similar to that found in a conventional dining experience chain entertainment – typically manifested in each market through the hard rock cafes the planet hollywoods etc we expect to create an atmosphere that thrives on its trendy feel these chain entertainment venues can not hope to draw the same “hip” clientele click here to view this full business plan related articles restaurants  bars nightclub sample business plan sample by entrepreneur if you are looking into starting a
