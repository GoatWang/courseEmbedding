test of kidney function accugfr is being developed as a more accurate and precise test of kidney function to aid in the diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease ckd the test uses a single fasted blood draw to measure four metabolites and provide clinicians with an easy means to precisely determine their patients’ level of kidney function accugfr may be used for the quantitative determination of glomerular filtration rate gfr in serum to aid in the diagnosis and management of renal diseases today  percent of the world’s population has some form of ckd and millions die each year from its complications known as a “silent killer” ckd can go undetected without signs or symptoms until a person has lost  percent of their kidney function the world health organization predicts that the prevalence of ckd will increase nearly  percent in the next decade making it a global public health issue providing clinical value beyond existing tests approximately  million serum creatinine tests are done each year in the us to provide estimates of glomerular filtration rate egfr as a measure of kidney function however only about twothirds of egfr results are within  percent of the patient’s measured gfr mgfr the gold standard method while mgfr is the most accurate procedure for determining gfr it is a complex invasive and expensive procedure with limited patient access in large studies conducted so far accugfr has shown to be more precise and accurate than the standards of care egfr methodologies based on creatinine or cystatin c mdrd and ckdepi equations we believe that the superior precision of accugfr and the fact that it does not require demographic variables has great potential to provide on a global basis clinical value beyond mdrd nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash test nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld is one of the most prevalent chronic conditions in the us nonalcoholic steatohepatitis nash is a more advanced serious form of liver disease and has a prevalence of  to  percent in the general us population nash not only involves excess fat accumulation in the liver but also chronic inflammation that may lead to progressive hepatic fibrosis scarring of the liver tissue this in turn can lead to cirrhosis liver failure and death being able to identify whether a patient with suspected or confirmed liver disease has nash or not andor what level of liver fibrosis the patient has would provide new ways to manage and control this condition especially as new drugs and treatment options become commercially available global health assessment clinicians are all familiar with metabolites such as cholesterol glucose and creatinine in fact there are a limited number of metabolites routinely measured in clinical practice but what if you could measure hundreds of metabolites from a single sample we are developing a comprehensive health assessment product to guide diagnostic and lifelong clinical management decisions this allinone panel aims to screen key metabolites that reflect a patient’s health across many areas such as cardiovascular kidney and liver health macronutrient balance metabolic age microbiome balance and diabetes oxidative stress and inflammatory markers our team is currently working with key health innovators and healthcare providers to develop the test in addition to wellness screening there are  million cases of undiagnosed disease in the us and europe and  million cases worldwide undiagnosed and difficult to diagnose diseases such as chronic fatigue syndrome represent a large and expensive
