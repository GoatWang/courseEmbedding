in corporate news and information ceocfo mobile    contact     ceocfoservices   home devicebased treatment for ulcerative colitis     marc ramer founder ceo   asana medical inc wwwasanamedicalcom   interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfo magazine published � march     ceocfo mr ramer would you tell us the concept for asana mr ramer asana medical is an earlystage medical device company in the gastrointestinal space specifically we are developing a devicebased treatment for ulcerative colitis right now the only therapies available to treat ulcerative colitis are inadequate and there is no good treatment option available for example the drugs used to treat ulcerative colitis can potentially have devastating side effects such as lymphoma skin cancer or tuberculosis even then  to  of patients fail to respond to even those severe drugs and have no alternative but have their colons removed which is a major and life altering surgery   ceocfo how will you do that mr ramer we have come up with a medical device that sets up the colon to heal itself thereby eliminating the symptoms of the disease   ceocfo is that the ecmh mr ramer yes that is correct it is ecmh extracellular matrix hydrogel   ceocfo would you give us a description of ulcerative colitis mr ramer ulcerative colitis is a disease in which the body attacks the lining of the colon called the mucosa once the body attacks the mucosa it breaks down and the colon can no longer function properly once that happens it manifests in a series of debilitating symptoms including symptoms like chronic bloody diarrhea pain tremendous urgency to use the restroom and frequent bowel movements i have heard of cases where uc patients go up to  times in a day there is a big psychological component as well people feel like they are chained to the bathroom even worse it can lead to malnutrition because of chronic dehydration and ultimately a greatly increased risk of colon cancer   ceocfo did you set out looking for a technology to address this situation or did you come upon it and realize the potential mr ramer this disease is in my family and i saw a family member go through colon removal surgery i am a biomedical engineer by training and a loving family member and i had to find a better way sitting with that family member postop i hatched the idea that ultimately became this company but not with this specific technology i thought why couldn�t we somehow replace the diseased mucosa and stimulate the regrowth of healthy new mucosa after networking through some prominent scientists i came upon one named dr stephen badylak dr badylak is the deputy director of the mcgowan institute for regenerative medicine at the university of pittsburgh he was sold on the concept from our very first conversation steve is one of the world�s foremost authorities in tissueengineered products which includes ecmh and he has helped commercialize ecmbased technologies for multiple clinical applications he immediately saw the potential of this and we have been working together collaboratively ever since   ceocfo are the people that should know of asana aware of what you are doing mr ramer it is early but to the extent that is appropriate we are getting the word out to the medical world we have a medical advisory board that is unusually strong for a startup company like ours these key opinion leaders see the potential in what we can do for their patients our first task is to develop the product and process then get it into humans and ultimately commercialize right now it is not as important to get the message out to the clinical world as it is to get it out to the investment world   ceocfo what is the market potential here mr ramer it is substantial our estimate is that the market ultimately exceeds  billion and we hope to capture a substantial portion of that  million people worldwide have ulcerative colitis there are about  million in the eu and nearly  in north america the patient population multiplied by the projected price point of ecmh which will be competitive with the existing biologic drugs equates to a  billion market opportunity   ceocfo are there competing technologies of which you are aware mr ramer we consider the biologic drugs our primary competition because there is no medical device that we are aware of that is positioned to treat ulcerative colitis occasionally a colorectal surgeon or gi will put in a stent for example to open a colonic stricture or a narrowing but that is just treating symptoms we are unique in that regard there are stemcellbased technologies involving tissueengineering approaches to regrow colons but they are only in the preliminary stages and not near commercialization   ceocfo what is the ip situation for you mr ramer our ip situation is strong we have one core patent on which i am an inventor along with two of our colleagues from the university of pittsburgh we are licensing from pitt two additional patents that describe ecmh�s composition and manufacturing process   ceocfo what part does the fda play in regulating mr ramer it plays a substantial part this product is going to be regulated as a device we are confident of this based on ecm products having been regulated historically as devices   ceocfo what is going on right now at asana mr ramer we are doing preclinical work as part of product development right now this includes our benchtop testing and our animal testing to develop a product that ultimately will be proven safe and effective in a smallscale human clinical trial we have conducted four animal studies and we have a very important and large one starting soon that combined with the benchtop testing will provide the data we need for an fda submission   ceocfo have there been any surprises so far mr ramer a positive one insofar as we are a medical device startup but the caliber of people we have attracted to the table are the kinds of individuals you typically see at more established companies people who already have established names and reputations in the field i think that speaks to the substance of asana and the great potential of what we are offering   ceocfo what are your plans for developing the company  mr ramer our daily focus has been to cultivate the necessary financial and human resources that will help us continue our rapid device development the projected cost for us to produce human data in two years is in the neighborhood of  million dollars even if we could afford to selffinance operations and clinical trials our experience has shown us that joining with the right strategic partners and investors can exponentially improve our chances for success so we are proceeding along this path   ceocfo what is the interest in ulcerative colitis today mr ramer given the size of the market and the fact that there is a large unmet market need right now to address ibd which is irritable bowel disease there is a substantial market opportunity available many people we speak with have a personal link to ibd so they are interested from both a business perspective and a personal one   ceocfo i think it may be helpful that it is easy to understand mr ramer i think people identify with it because even if you have not had one of these diseases certainly everyone at some point has had some gastric distress   ceocfo what have you learned from your background as a biomedical engineer mr ramer i would say a sense of perspective in my career i have worked on everything from advanced rd which is the proverbial sketch on the cocktail napkin to commercialization and post market surveillance i have seen the full gamut of what it takes to get a product to market and follow it once in the market having that perspective means knowing how to leverage your resources appropriately to each stage of the product and process development effort i have learned especially after having been ceo of asana that things do not happen as quickly or as smoothly as you would hope and nobody gets a smooth ride through a medical device startup it is not about expecting a smooth ride but rather anticipating bumps in the road and knowing how to mitigate those risks and put contingency plans in place   ceocfo how do people reach out to you if they want more information mr ramer i would say they should first check out our website to learn more about us at wwwasanamedicalcom there is a contact us page on the website where they can reach out with questions the emails and phone calls will come to me directly and i would be happy to entertain any questions   ceocfo why does asana standout mr ramer asana truly is a special medical device startup opportunity the caliber of the individuals we have attracted people with a record of success already is special likewise the quality and caliber of our various advisory boards is very high we have proven that our technology works in a preliminary animal study we have passion within
