richter of the examiner staff published  am monday january   image of captionclose image  of  image  of  fewer acres for orchids    back to gallery   pdt south san francisco san mateo  the rod mclellan co world renowned for its orchids has sold its acre acres of orchids in south san francisco to a housing developer and has moved its retail store and headquarters to san mateo the move marks the end of an era and reflects a bay area trend the company was the last major agricultural operation on the bay side of the peninsula where farming and flowergrowing once flourished as development pressures increased however the land became too valuable to use for agriculture housing tracts replaced greenhouses latest business videos that scenario is being repeated in south san francisco where greystone homes has bought the land on hickey boulevard and plans to build  detached houses said steve delva president of greystones south bay division in addition midpeninsula housing coalition plans  attached houses to be sold at belowmarket rates also planned is a acre city park the fact that bart plans to build a new station across the street as part of its airport extension makes the land even more valuable delva said we think its an excellent location mclellans new squarefoot site in san mateo opened saturday it includes a retail store corporate offices and propagation lab where orchids are grown by germinating seed or by cloning said marvell sherrill director of tours customers also can drop off and pick up their orchids for mclellans orchid spa a boarding service that provides optimum conditions for orchids when theyre not blooming while those orchids were formerly tended in mclellans south city greenhouses now theyre going to watsonville where the company is consolidating its growing operations the company has had  acres in watsonville since  and initially grew carnations and garlic as its orchid business expanded the company grew the plants in both south city and watsonville lower land costs and consolidation will mean lower production costs said jeff britt president and chief executive officer of rod mclellan co another mclellan product decorative preserved eucalyptus also will be produced solely in watsonville production of mclellans other major product bagged supersoilpotting mix will move from south city to a new plant in lathrop near stockton this location will mean better access to sacramento as well as the bay area because traffic is so bad on the freeways around south city that trucks are often delayed britt said supersoil which the company developed with researchers at the university of california in  also is made at a companyowned plant in bakersfield which will remain open mclellan will keep its retail store at the san francisco flower market and hopes to open a new store near the south city property the present south city store will remain open through the end of february the company has about  employees of the  in south city some will move with the company while others have opted not to britt said he said it really hasnt had a huge effect on our employee base in the meantime the land is being annexed to the city which has approved the tentative subdivision map delva said demolition will begin soon and home sales are expected to start in august or september with occupancy early next year prices probably will range from the low s to the low s mclellan officials had realized a move was inevitable but it came sooner than expected when greystone expressed interest britt said lorraine mclellan vice chairman of the board of directors and widow of rod mclellan said her husband had told her the land probably would be have to sold after his death but that was  years ago im pleased we could keep it so long she said last week during a preview of the san mateo store she and three other family members  daughter lorraine mclellan vice president daughter lynn mclellan secretary and grandson roderick taylor who represents the familys fifth generation  serve on the board of directors along with chairman william eames except for the san mateo site which is leased the family owns all of the land and leases it to the company britt said the mclellan saga began in  when rods grandfather david arrived in san francisco from new york and bought  acres at what is now third and market streets there he grew fruits and vegetables for the citys booming population in  he traded that land for  acres in what is now the hillsdale area of san mateo where he started a dairy and produce business his son edgar began growing flowers in  nine years later edgar bought seven acres in burlingame to grow roses carnations and chrysanthemums by  the ew mclellan co had  square feet of greenhouses the most west of the mississippi in  the company became the first to ship cut flowers on ice in railroad cars his son rod became involved after graduating from stanford in  the same year that the company moved to south city rod mclellan produced more floral business firsts in  when he developed the gardenia corsage and began using paper shipping cartons and cellophane wrapping orchids entered the picture in  when rod realized they could be grown by anyone they werent just the domain of the rich said tour director sherrill he established the rod mclellan co in  and published its first acres of orchids catalog since then the company has attracted thousands of visitors every year from all walks of life including royalty like queen ingrid of denmark  and first lady mamie eisenhower  who has a mclellan orchid named in her honor with that history people are so sad that the south san francisco venue is not going to be there said sherrill who has been with the company for  years however to celebrate its st anniversary as a familyowned business and to emphasize its intentions to stay on the peninsula the company will host an orchid show march  and  at the san mateo county expo center in san mateo the new
