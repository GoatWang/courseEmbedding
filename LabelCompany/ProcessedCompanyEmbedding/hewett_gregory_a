physics applied physics  is an introduction to physics for engineering utilizing a team based and project based style of learning below are the six projects that i completed with six different teams for the class over the course of my freshman year rube goldberg machine to demonstrate learning of fundamental kinematics and energy teams were required to construct a rube goldberg machine that could crack an egg symphosium the symphosium project was geared toward material regarding the properties of waves each time was instructed to create an instrument that could be implemented in el sistema an organization that fights poverty with music the instrument had many specifications such as playing a full octave and being in tune within  hz it also had to be extremely economical and easy to adapt to el sistema our team chose to create a glockenspiel an instrument similar to a xylophone crackathon the goal of this project was to implement the fundamental principles of electromagnetism and create a secure but crackable safe our team used many components including smart glassglass that starts out opaque and becomes clear when a current is run through it and a robotic car that follows a black line via sensors the safe is designed to keep a user stumped for at least  minutes ecotricity the goal of this project was to implement the principles of electrostatics to solve an environmental problem my team chose to use the concept of a precipitator to improve the function and efficiency of a catalytic converter mission to mars click to enlarge poster this project was designed to showcase material regarding motion in a circle as well as encompassing kinematics and energy as a team we created a plan for a manned mission to mars and mapped out a journey that involved leaving earth orbiting and landing on mars and returning to earth yes we came back we calculated energies trajectories as well as the time of the trip spectrometer this project was geared towards waves and optics each team was required to build a spectrometer out of a box of given materials the materials were quite basic but included lenses and magnifying glasses this spectrometer is capable of identifying one light source from  meters away and distinguishing three light sources from  meters away close high school autocad the following work was completed during my senior year of high school in an advanced engineering design and presentation course i am certified in both autocad and inventor thank you to mr frank anderson instructor of engineering design and presentation at the byron martin advanced technology center lubbock texas arbor press this is a mechanical representation of an arbor press a machine commonly used to perform press fit work all of the parts were individually designed and built to adhere to strict design specifications and standards after the parts were built the pieces were then assembled together and set into motion the resulting animation is a movie representation of an arbor press at work built using autodesk inventor centering attachment this is a mechanical representation of a centering attachment all of the parts were built individually to exact design standards and then each part was assembled to create the machine an animation was produced to model the function of the machine built using autodesk inventor high school tire tread this is a physical representation of the tread of an irrigation tire mcwhorter tire co of lubbock texas came to my high schools advanced engineering design and presentation class and asked us to design a tire tread in cad software to be used in their production of irrigation pivot tires after taking dimensions of a physical tire i led a team of four in designing and recreating this tire tread a rubber manufacturer now produces strips of these treads which are fused to old semitruck tires to create a cheaper irrigation pivot tire that is used by farmers all over west texas built using autodesk autocad and inventor close courses taken sophomore fall electrical engineering   introduction to electrical engineering the main course objectives are to introduce students to the exciting and powerful world of
