also continue to invest in our craft brands to develop these future growth engines latin america north we had a very difficult year in brazil in  our beer volumes were down  for the year driven by continued pressure on consumer disposable income net revenue declined by  with net revenue per hl up  as part of our revenue management strategy we are using our complete portfolio of packs and brands to achieve attractive more competitive consumer price points this includes growing our mix of returnable glass bottles rgbs a format that now accounts for  of our volume in the supermarket channel while rgbs have a negative impact on net revenue per hl they can help boost ebitda and margin over time although  has been a very challenging year in brazil we remain optimistic about the future for

latin america south despite outstanding performance from our global brands and overall business growth in paraguay and chile our latin america south zone had a tough  we saw contraction in consumption and the industry in argentina due to structural reforms higher tariffs and high inflation solid revenue management and cost controls helped offset volume declines in the zone and price increases in

volumes for the region grew  with topline expansion of  the industry struggled in ecuador due to a tough macro environment combined with the aftermath of a strong earthquake in april the trading environments in colombia and peru were less challenging our global brands performed well throughout the region corona helped develop the premium segment with its expanded coverage and disruptive consumer experiences via its sunsets platform in corona’s home country of mexico preference and volume gains for both corona extra and corona light provided a boost to the brand which now represents nearly half of our domestic beer sales we launched the noalcohol corona cero in mexico with a “same taste no alcohol” campaign and expect it to help create new consumption occasions and increase consumption frequency in the country strengthened by consistent positioning efforts premium brands club colombia in colombia and cusqueña in peru delivered doubledigit topline growth we also continued to develop innovative new options including bud light mangorita victoria chelada victoria oro modelo trigo club colombia trigo cusqueña quinua redd’s apple and pony malta plus asia pacific a tough macro environment and extreme weather put pressure on the industry in china and south korea in  despite stable economies industry volumes contracted in both markets in australia a portfolio shift

performance in  with positive momentum across all key segments in australia we took over distribution rights for corona stella artois budweiser and our other premium brands as part of the combination

beer market india represents a significant opportunity as a combined entity in india we are now the second largest brewer with  breweries the increase in scale in the country will help relieve

materials regulatory news corporate governance the corporate governance rules established by the anheuserbusch inbev board of directors support our business ambitions they ensure that the company is responsibly managed and properly controlled without limiting vision or hampering swift action the rules establish a framework of best practices a way of thinking and the modus operandi within and around the company to ensure clarity and proper conduct   introduction as a company incorporated under belgian law and listed on euronext brussels anheuserbusch inbev adheres to the principles and provisions of the belgian corporate governance code published in march    the majority of the code is reflected in anheuserbusch inbev’s corporate governance rules the complete set of these corporate governance rules is posted on the corporate governance charter page the rules are regularly updated in order to reflect anheuserbusch inbev’s specific shareholding structure and the global nature of its operations the board of directors has nevertheless adopted the following rules which depart from the belgian corporate governance code   principle  appendix d of the belgian code “the board should set up a nomination committee composed of a majority of independent nonexecutive directors” the board of directors appoints the chairman and members of the compensation and nominating committee from among the directors including at least one member from among the independent directors as the committee is composed exclusively of nonexecutive directors who are independent of management and free from any business relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgment the board considers that the composition of this committee achieves the code’s aim of avoiding potential conflicts of interest   principle  of the belgian code  “nonexecutive directors should not be entitled to performancerelated remuneration such as bonuses stockrelated longterm incentive schemes fringe benefits or pension benefits”  the remuneration of the board members is composed of a fixed fee and a limited predetermined number of options which ensures the independence of the board members as well as aligning the directors’ interests with those of the shareholders the board of directors considers it very unlikely that the granting of options could affect their judgement as board members as a consequence the board considers anheuserbusch inbev’s principles of remuneration compatible with the recommendations of the belgian code on corporate governance   finally it should be noted that options may only be granted upon the recommendation of the compensation and nominating committee any such recommendation must be subsequently approved by the board and the shareholders in a general meeting   further to the new york stock exchange listing of ads’s representing ordinary shares of anheuserbusch inbev the new york stock exchange corporate governance rules for foreign private issuers are applicable to the company according to these rules the company discloses in item g of its annual report on form f significant ways in which its corporate governance practices differ from those followed by companies listed on the nyse   finally anheuserbusch inbev has registered with the united states securities and exchange commission “sec” as a result it is subject to the sarbanesoxley act of  and to rules of the sec relating to corporate governance       corporate governance charter we are committed to achieving the highest standards of corporate

commission today announced that anheuserbusch inbev has agreed to pay  million to settle charges that it violated the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and chilled a whistleblower who reported the misconduct an sec investigation found that the company used thirdparty sales promoters to make improper payments to government officials in india to increase the sales and production of anheuserbusch inbev products in that country  despite repeated complaints from employees anheuserbusch inbev had inadequate internal accounting controls to detect and prevent the improper payments and the company failed to ensure that transactions involving the promoters were recorded properly in its books and records   the sec’s order further finds that anheuserbusch inbev entered into a separation agreement that stopped an employee from continuing to voluntarily communicate with the sec about potential fcpa violations due to a substantial financial penalty that would be imposed for violating strict nondisclosure terms   “anheuserbusch inbev recorded improper payments by its sales promoters in india as legitimate expenses in its financial accounting and then exacerbated the problem by including language in a separation agreement that chilled an employee from communicating with the sec” said kara brockmeyer chief of the sec enforcement division’s fcpa unit    “threat of financial punishment for whistleblowing is unacceptable” added jane norberg acting chief of the sec’s office of the whistleblower  “we will continue to take a hard look at these types of provisions and fact patterns”   the sec’s order finds that anheuserbusch inbev which is headquartered in leuven belgium violated the books and records provisions and the internal controls provisions of the federal securities laws as well as securities exchange act rule fa  anheuserbusch inbev agreed to pay  in disgorgement plus interest of  and a penalty of   for a twoyear period the company must cooperate with the sec and report its fcpa compliance efforts while making reasonable efforts to notify certain former employees that anheuserbusch inbev does not prohibit employees from contacting the sec about possible law violations   the sec’s investigation was conducted by morgan b ward doran sonali singh and carol shau and supervised by alka patel  the sec appreciates the assistance of the fraud section of the
