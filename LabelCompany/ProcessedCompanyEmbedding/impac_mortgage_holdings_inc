talk log in     jamboree rdirvine ca    incredibly great experience with this mortgage company id rate it  stars if possible last year we went through our seattlebased mortgage broker when we refinanced our home loan we were assigned to impac mortgage and completed the process last november we received an email from leif potter from impac asking us if were were interested in doing a streamline refinance which would lower our monthly payment my wife made contact with mr potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone by far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done what has impressed my wife and i more than anything was how professional leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process we were constantly kept up to date on time lines document requests and recent federal loan changes unlike our previous refinance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months and constantly received criptic emails regarding the delays impac has gone way beyond our expectations there has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise or has not been fully explained we appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process my wife and i highly recommend this company if you are considering refinancing or establishing a new mortgage more so we highly recommend you contact mr leif potter you will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients he is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust this stupid company f up my property taxes theyve been collecting it in impounds but didnt bother to pay it  i find out today because i was doing my income taxes i see theres a  late fee assessed you think i can get those for her to pay it im not holding my breath  just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year these people are f idiots try to speak to a supervisor they tell me no supervisor will take calls what kind of fuked up place is this first i was transferred four times each time the representative of impac was so rude they didnt give me a chance to explain how i needed help if they had i wouldnt have been transferred so many times after the above fun not i sat on hold for  mins i was finally connected to sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date if she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry this company is rude unprofessional and i pray my loan is sold soon so i dont have to deal with these donkeys relative to the other alternative lenders in the california lending market jason vaccariellos team at impac mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing  terms ive brokered altdoc deals to all of their competitors and from experience i can tell you that all other alternative lenders are administratively incompetent bordering on negligent whereas jason and his impac mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not the loan process with alternative lenders are inherently more complicated and timeconsuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined such as stated income or borrowers with damaged credit despite these challenges impac still comes through and funds deals even though its not always easy my brokerage has funded close to  deals with them so far and counting zero stars these people are pure shit got a preapproval not prequal letter sold my house bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where i wanted to move then told i dont qualify unless you want a complete idiot to fuck your life up avoid these pieces of shit if you are thinking of working for this companydont the company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their quality control department in specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism seriously the vp needs to take a course in human ethics this company fuxxxxxcking sucks  star from everyone how is this company still in business they collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it i called them press and  and  and  and  and  hold  minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait after half hour someone picks up what is you loan number what is your address what is this and what is that you guys are taking my taxes and not paying them you are responsible for that now us ok cancel my escrow ill pay my own taxes email us or fax us i emailed them and got auto email back saying well get back to you in  business days  business days fuk this company i refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the st and late on the th if they dont have it the st the phone is ringing off the damn hook i never thought i would miss bofa but i do in  years of owning homes i have never ever been late and have an  fico score these aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back bs i just blocked their  fu impac im updating them to a  because they finally fixed my impound account and i havent had any problems with them since i still wouldnt recommend them due to the rough start my loan was sold to impac mortgage i am now counting down the days to refinance again have to wait  months so i can leave this company they charge to auto draft from your checking account to pay them i scheduled my auto draft on the rd they charge from  days to  days they sent me a notice i was scheduled for the th assuming so they could charge me i had to call them once there is phone loop they put you through you keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep i had to do this at least  times before i got a person i was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone i would never use this company i am waiting to refinance so i can leave this company update is it now march and this has not been resolved i was in touch with someone named dargis martinez who has been little to no help i have since been reimbursed for the amount i overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment i have left  messages for dargis and no response if you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is  do not go near impac mortgage zero starsthey will ruin your life with the bullshit stories theyll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end they order an appraisal on our house in may of  and it was completed only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault not sure how that works but at any rate on the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process which we did a few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly really two appraisals i guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel we own the home outright just need a little money for a home facelift the home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan hmmmmm so with that being said we added the stairs and the carpet the home is almost done on the inside very small stuff now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter the entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money we were hoping to have this rented out on june st nope not a chance the second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal our hard work has paid off which we thoughtso we started our loan process on  in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by  nope still no loan and not rented out on  we were told we were going to sign papers on  and have our money soon well with that being said on   pm we still had not heard a word from them so i sent an email with no response back and they close at pm finally at pm i got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed no loan so here we sit no money they nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line which we did everything they asked of us i mean everything we put our home life on hold we tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running it took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us no at one point i told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us they said no we wouldnt do that to anyone bullshit i repeat dont go near this company they should be shut down and im surprised they dont have any lawsuits against them maybe they do and no one can post about it this review is a no stars review stay away from impac i called them before i saw these reviews they made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back the guy wasnt very nice and eventually told me i did not qualify they follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what i heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false stay away impac mortage is impossible to work with they cant find payments sent electronically from my bank wells fargo despite conference calls with the bank people they put customers on hold forever and its impossible to speak with a supervisor if you fax information with proof of fax they say they cant find the fax everything has to be researched with a  business day research period please if you have a choice dont use impac mortgage impac commercial lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service they put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner they give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount on top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over  they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business mr ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable forbes magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage it is appalling to see a president of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically i am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company i do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending please beware before doing any loans with them absolute disaster bunch of unprofessional people dont waist your time i have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and thats all they did after paying  for an appraisal i waited and waited and waited for whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues  oh yeah what issues house appraised for  below what they thought it would and we are talking about  loan for  years  give me a break please i have been paying my current loan for  years with never being late i have steady job  perfect credit score there are issues  what kind of issuesno one knows i suppose besides the fact that having a property in san francisco bay area you cant risk anything bottom line dont waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending horrible experience

and nothing but heart ache at the end  they order an appraisal on our house in may of   and it was completed only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault not sure how that works but at any rate on the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process which we did a few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly  really two appraisals i guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel we own the home outright just need a little money for a home facelift the home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan hmmmmm so with that being said we added the stairs and the carpet the home is almost done on the inside very small stuff  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter the entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money we were hoping to have this rented out on june st nope not a chance  the second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal our hard work has paid off which we thoughtso we started our loan process on  in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by  nope still no loan and not rented out on  we were told we were going to sign papers on  and have our money soon well with that being said on   pm we still had not heard a word from them so i sent an email with no response back and they close at pm finally at pm i got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed no loan so here we sit no money they nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line which we did everything they asked of us i mean everything we put our home life on hold we tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running it took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us no  at one point i told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us they said no we wouldnt do that to anyone bullshit i repeat

review compliment send message follow dilu v stop following dilu v  impac  commercial lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service they put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner they give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amounton top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand   impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen  they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they are intimidating techniques for doing businessmr ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable forbes  magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage it is appalling to see a president of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically i am sure the way he acts is translated

mortgage rate lock recommendation july    float todays outlook just as at this time yesterday it is looking as if mortgage rates might edge down today or perhaps hold steady however that forecast is based on early market trends and those frequently change speed or direction during the day so a sharper fall or even a rise remain possible our prediction could be undermined in coming hours by economic political and geopolitical news that might affect the american and global economies though little is scheduled for coming hours still if we were currently buying a home we would float our rate now and revisit that decision on monday morning read on to discover why you might prefer to lock average rates for year fixedrate mortgages were unchanged yesterday remaining at a low for july however they remain noticeably higher than at some times earlier in the year including toward the end of june indeed if you glance at the chart above you will see the previously firm downward trend since march sharply reversed in june rates could fall further in a sustained way but there is no guarantee of that what happens next will depend on whether relevant news becomes more or less positive in coming days absent other factors good news tends to push mortgage rates up while bad news usually pulls them down many experts would urge you to look now particularly if you need to lock anyway within the next few weeks others might suggest you continue to float providing you have time to ride out the coming nearinevitable ups and downs they perceive recent rises as having mainly been the results of technical stimuli to do with government bond markets in europe rather than firm evidence of improving health in the underlying us economy but neither group of experts has a crystal ball and there remains a real possibility of continuing volatility so either way you are taking a chance only you can decide on the level of risk with which you are comfortable mortgage rates in the news today further falls in mortgage rates may be on the cards today mortgage rates might fall today – maybe significantly potential for mortgage rates to move significantly today but which way mortgage rates look set to fall again today mortgage rates look likely to fall or hold steady today what does it mean to lock your mortgage locking your mortgage means that you and your lender have agreed on an interest rate and price for your home loan once your loan is locked thats the rate and price you get regardless of what happens in the financial markets if rates go up youre protected but if rates go down you wont benefit either  you close your loan at the rate youve locked and you can’t change it locks have expiration dates ranging from  to  days or more and the longer your lock period the more it costs if you dont close your loan on time you could end up paying a higher interest rate when should you lock you can lock in your loan at any time during the process until you lock your interest rate you are said to be floating your mortgage the only rule is that you have to lock in before you can close on your purchase or refinance the decision to lock or float your loan can have a long term impact so it’s important you make the right choice that’s why we offer a quick rundown of the key factors that drive mortgage rates today and everything you need to know mortgage types the type of mortgage you get will affect the type of mortgage rate you qualify for see below for the most common types of mortgages and what rates you could be eligible for conventional mortgage a conventional

seattlebased mortgage broker when we refinanced our home loan we were assigned to impac mortgage and completed the process last november we received an email from leif potter from impac asking us if were were interested in doing a streamline refinance which would lower our monthly payment my wife made contact with mr potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone by far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done what has impressed my wife and i more than anything was how professional leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process we were constantly kept up to date on time lines document requests and recent federal loan changes unlike our previous refinance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months and constantly received criptic emails regarding the delays impac has gone way beyond our expectations there has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise or has not been fully explained we appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process my wife and i highly recommend this company if you are considering refinancing or establishing a new mortgage more so we highly recommend you contact mr leif potter you will be delighted with his customer service and how well he communicates with his clients he is well versed in the mortgage process and is someone you can trust this stupid company f up my property taxes theyve been collecting it in impounds but didnt bother to pay it  i find out today because i was doing my income taxes i see theres a  late fee assessed you think i can get those for her to pay it im not holding my breath  just screwed up my tax refund too by not paying it last year these people are f idiots try to speak to a supervisor they tell me no supervisor will take calls what kind of fuked up place is this first i was transferred four times each time the representative of impac was so rude they didnt give me a chance to explain how i needed help if they had i wouldnt have been transferred so many times after the above fun not i sat on hold for  mins i was finally connected to sheranda who allowed me only to ask one question before she started rattling off a policy that states they cannot change the payment due date if she had given me time to explain she would have discovered there was much more to my inquiry this company is rude unprofessional and i pray my loan is sold soon so i dont have to deal with these donkeys relative to the other alternative lenders in the california lending market jason vaccariellos team at impac mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing  terms ive brokered altdoc deals to all of their competitors and from experience i can tell you that all other alternative lenders are administratively incompetent bordering on negligent whereas jason and his impac mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not the loan process with alternative lenders are inherently more complicated and timeconsuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined such as stated income or borrowers with damaged credit despite these challenges impac still comes through and funds deals even though its not always easy my brokerage has funded close to  deals with them so far and counting zero stars these people are pure shit got a preapproval not prequal letter sold my house bought a plane ticket to go put an offer down where i wanted to move then told i dont qualify unless you want a complete idiot to fuck your life up avoid these pieces of shit if you are thinking of working for this companydont the company is unprofessional and lacks integrity especially as it relates to their quality control department in specific the management of this department have egos and control issues that completely lacks an ounce of professionalism seriously the vp needs to take a course in human ethics this company fuxxxxxcking sucks  star from everyone how is this company still in business they collect my taxes and they pay the county half of it i called them press and  and  and  and  and  hold  minutes later enter your loan number or social and wait and wait and wait after half hour someone picks up what is you loan number what is your address what is this and what is that you guys are taking my taxes and not paying them you are responsible for that now us ok cancel my escrow ill pay my own taxes email us or fax us i emailed them and got auto email back saying well get back to you in  business days  business days fuk this company i refinanced my mortgage and the bill is due the st and late on the th if they dont have it the st the phone is ringing off the damn hook i never thought i would miss bofa but i do in  years of owning homes i have never ever been late and have an  fico score these aholes call and call and call with an automated call us back bs i just blocked their  fu impac im updating them to a  because they finally fixed my impound account and i havent had any problems with them since i still wouldnt recommend them due to the rough start my loan was sold to impac mortgage i am now counting down the days to refinance again have to wait  months so i can leave this company they charge to auto draft from your checking account to pay them i scheduled my auto draft on the rd they charge from  days to  days they sent me a notice i was scheduled for the th assuming so they could charge me i had to call them once there is phone loop they put you through you keep pushing some number on the phone to get a rep i had to do this at least  times before i got a person i was starting to think there was no one to pick up the phone i would never use this company i am waiting to refinance so i can leave this company update is it now march and this has not been resolved i was in touch with someone named dargis martinez who has been little to no help i have since been reimbursed for the amount i overpaid in the first four months but they have yet to reconfigure my monthly mortgage payment i have left  messages for dargis and no response if you would like to call her and try to get her to call me back her number is  do not go near impac mortgage zero starsthey will ruin your life with the bullshit stories theyll end up costing you more money and nothing but heart ache at the end they order an appraisal on our house in may of  and it was completed only to find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault not sure how that works but at any rate on the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process which we did a few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly really two appraisals i guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel we own the home outright just need a little money for a home facelift the home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan hmmmmm so with that being said we added the stairs and the carpet the home is almost done on the inside very small stuff now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter the entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money we were hoping to have this rented out on june st nope not a chance the second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal our hard work has paid off which we thoughtso we started our loan process on  in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by  nope still no loan and not rented out on  we were told we were going to sign papers on  and have our money soon well with that being said on   pm we still had not heard a word from them so i sent an email with no response back and they close at pm finally at pm i got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed no loan so here we sit no money they nickel and dimed us with two appraisals and a lot of running around to meet a dead line which we did everything they asked of us i mean everything we put our home life on hold we tried very hard not to spend any money and keep things up and running it took them four months of a lot of bullshit stories to tell us no at one point i told them that they were just waiting for us to screw up so they could us it against us they said no we wouldnt do that to anyone bullshit i repeat dont go near this company they should be shut down and im surprised they dont have any lawsuits against them maybe they do and no one can post about it this review is a no stars review stay away from impac i called them before i saw these reviews they made me fill out a lot of stuff online and then called me back the guy wasnt very nice and eventually told me i did not qualify they follow the same guidelines as major lenders from what i heard so the articles in which they are referenced are all false stay away impac mortage is impossible to work with they cant find payments sent electronically from my bank wells fargo despite conference calls with the bank people they put customers on hold forever and its impossible to speak with a supervisor if you fax information with proof of fax they say they cant find the fax everything has to be researched with a  business day research period please if you have a choice dont use impac mortgage impac commercial lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service they put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner they give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount on top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over  they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business mr ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable forbes magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage it is appalling to see a president of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically i am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company i do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending please beware before doing any loans with them absolute disaster bunch of unprofessional people dont waist your time i have tried to refinance my existing loan in good standing with credit score of they had me pay for an appraisal of my house and thats all they did after paying  for an appraisal i waited and waited and waited for whatever unexplained reason all they could say there some issues  oh yeah what issues house appraised for  below what they thought it would and we are talking about  loan for  years  give me a break please i have been paying my current loan for  years with never being late i have steady job  perfect credit score there are issues  what kind of issuesno one knows i suppose besides the fact that having a property in san francisco bay area you cant risk anything bottom line dont waist your time with this company they are ridiculously unprofessional and lucking knowledge on current mortgage lending horrible experience

with alternative lenders are inherently more complicated and timeconsuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional

the norm they need a check for which i scraped together and sent it certified mailthe only address i was given was a po  box so thats not making me feel very secure to top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed  weeks ago my bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through i just got off the phone with impac who told me over the

the california lending market jason vaccariellos team at impac mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing  terms ive brokered altdoc deals to all of their

per their guidelines whereas others do not  the loan process with alternative lenders are inherently more complicated and timeconsuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more

loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner they give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amounton top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand   impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing

due to the rough start relative to the other alternative lenders in the california lending market jason vaccariellos team at impac mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing  terms ive brokered altdoc deals to all of their competitors and from experience i can tell you that all other alternative lenders are administratively incompetent bordering on negligent whereas jason and his impac mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not the loan process with alternative lenders are inherently more complicated and timeconsuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined such as stated income or borrowers with damaged credit despite these challenges impac still comes through and funds deals even though its not always easy my brokerage has funded close to  deals with them so far and counting incredibly great experience with this mortgage company id rate it  stars if possible last year we went through our seattlebased mortgage broker when we refinanced our home loan we were assigned to impac mortgage and completed the process last november we received an email from leif potter from impac asking us if were were interested in doing a streamline refinance which would lower our monthly payment my wife made contact with mr potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phone by far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done what has impressed my wife and i more than anything was how professional leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process we were constantly kept up to date on time lines document requests and recent federal loan changes unlike our previous refinance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months and constantly received criptic emails regarding the delays impac has gone way beyond our expectations there has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise or has not been fully explained we appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the process

we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand   impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the

property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount on top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over  they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they

need a check for which i scraped together and sent it certified mailthe only address i was given was a po  box so thats not making me feel very secure to top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed  weeks ago my bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through i just got off the phone with impac who told me over the  they never

without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount on top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over  they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business mr ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable forbes magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage it is appalling to see a president of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically i am sure the way he acts is translated throughout the company i do hope that their practices are challenged in doing commercial lending please beware before doing any loans with them absolute disaster bunch of unprofessional people dont waist your time i have tried to refinance my existing loan

that the salesman did not set up a escrow account and when i asked about it he said they dont do that until after they receive the first mortgage payment this is my th time purchasing or refinancing and ive always had my escrow account set up at the time of transaction it is  months later and i am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for which i scraped together and sent it certified mailthe only address i was given was a po  box so thats not making me feel very secure to top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed  weeks ago my bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of proof that the fax went through i just got off the phone with impac who told me over the  they never

researched with a  business day research period please if you have a choice dont use impac mortgage impac commercial lending has unethical practices and have the worst customer service they put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner they give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount on top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over  they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business mr ashmore who is the president of the company and who has an article in a reputable forbes magazine talks to you as if you a piece of garbage it is appalling to see a president of the company treating their customer so rudely and unethically i am sure the way he acts

have the worst customer service they put hefty penalties for loans that are not revealed in an apparent manner they give loans without explaining the terms which are of course in fine print i am surprised that after the financial crisis they continue to work in such a way impac definitely need to be scrutinized by federal agencies on their practices and unethical ways of lending we had a commercial loan with them with at the time we got the loan there was a prepayment penalty we modified the loan  they charged us the prepayment penalty when modifying the loan on top of that they added a new prepayment penalty on the modified note we were desperate for the modification so had to accept their terms we sold the property and had to pay the prepayment penalty so now we have paid penalty twice of hefty amount on top of that what was most ethical was when we sold the property recently and the escrow company got the payoff demand  impac charged us an extra month of interest they said that we had to let them know  days in advance that we are closing the loan with them that is a complete robbery i am surprised that these practices are allowed to charge an extra month of interest if the lender is not notified  days in advance that they will be closing the loan this was over  they have the worst customer service their senior management is the worst i have ever seen they are rude lack the proper communication skills and plain out unethical they refuse to communicate to their customers if they do they are intimidating techniques for doing business mr ashmore who is the

follow bob o stop following bob o  incredibly great experience with this mortgage company id rate it  stars if possiblelast year we went through our seattlebased mortgage broker when we refinanced our home loan we were assigned to impac mortgage and completed the process last november we received an email from leif potter from impac asking us if were were interested in doing a streamline refinance which would lower our monthly payment my wife made contact with mr potter and agreed to start the process based on how professional he was on the phoneby far this was the smoothest real estate loan we have ever done what has impressed my wife and i more than anything was how professional leif and his associates have been throughout the entire process we were constantly kept up to date on time lines document requests and recent federal loan changes unlike our previous refinance process with our broker where we our kept us in the dark for months and constantly received criptic emails regarding the delays impac has gone way beyond our expectations there has not been one element of this loan transaction that has been a surprise or has not been fully explained we appreciated timely responses to any questions we had during the processmy wife and i highly recommend this company if you are considering refinancing or establishing a new mortgage more so we highly recommend you contact mr leif

to the other alternative lenders in the california lending market jason vaccariellos team at impac mortgage offers the most efficient loan processing at the most competitive pricing  terms ive

impac mortgage team actually funds deals per their guidelines whereas others do not  the loan process with alternative lenders are inherently more complicated and timeconsuming than with conventional lenders as they are generally more complex unique and complicated loan scenarios that conventional lenders have declined such as stated income or borrowers with damaged credit despite these challenges

am still trying to set up the account only rather than building it into the loan which is the norm they need a check for which i scraped together and sent it certified mailthe only address i was given was a po  box so thats not making me feel very secure to top it off they have lost this months payment which my bank shows as processed  weeks ago my bank faxed them the proof and gave me a copy of

find out that they ordered the wrong one and stated it was our fault not sure how that works but at any rate on the first appraisal it stated we needed to hang doors and add fire alarms to finish our process which we did a few months go by and they decided they needed another appraisal which was going to be much more extensive and costly  really two appraisals i guestioned them about the second appraisal and raised holly hell with them which them they come back and state you need to add stairs on deck and add carpet to the house never mentioned in first appraisal to be completed mined you yet this is a refinance on a rental for a complete remodel we own the home outright just need a little money for a home facelift the home appraised for more then what we are asking for in a loan hmmmmm so with that being said we added the stairs and the carpet the home is almost done on the inside very small stuff  now we just need a little paint on the outside and some fence repairs and it will be ready for a renter the entire time we have worked on this home hoping for a little money we were hoping to have this rented out on june st nope not a chance  the second appraisal was done and our little investment appraised for much higher then the first appraisal our hard work has paid off which we thoughtso we started our loan process on  in hope to have the remodel completed and rented out by  nope still no loan and not rented out on  we were told we were going to sign papers on  and have our money soon well with that being said on   pm we still had not heard a word from them so i sent an email with no response back and they close at pm finally at pm i got a call stating sorry your paperwork has expired and your credit score has changed no loan so here we sit no money they
