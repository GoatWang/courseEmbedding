to overhaul airtraffic control equipment through the nextgen project a billiondollar effort to use satellites rather than groundbased radar to guide airplanes   born and raised in coral gables florida babbitt  is the son of wt “slim” babbitt a retired eastern airlines captain and margaret babbitt he attended the university of georgia and the university of miami before beginning his own career as a pilot for eastern in    during his  years as a commercial airline pilot flying dcs he became actively involved in the air line pilots association alpa the world’s largest union of airline pilots in the early s he served on several local alpa committees for eastern pilots and was later elected and served two years as vice chairman of the eastern pilots based in miami babbitt also chaired alpa’s national collective bargaining committee and its presidential committee on labor standards   in  he was chosen as the union’s executive administrator which called for assisting the president of alpa in a wide range of areas including administering staff departments acting as liaison between the national office and membership councils and pilot committees and troubleshooting collective bargaining situations babbitt was in this position when eastern airlines went on strike in —which resulted in  employees losing their jobs to replacement workers hired by the airline some of the fired pilots filed a class action lawsuit against the union on grounds that it failed to pursue other jobs for them   in  babbitt was elected president and ceo of the union serving two terms the following year he publicly slammed the federal government’s deregulation of the airline industry claiming the move had sent it into a “nosedive” and cost too many jobs he also publicly criticized samuel skinner secretary of transportation under president george h w bush and the faa for failing to upgrade the nation’s air traffic control system   in  he convinced the airline pilots union to endorse bill clinton for president—after decades of the union standing on the sidelines during presidential races   six years later babbitt backed the decision by pilots of northwest airlines to go on strike which lasted  days the longest strike of its kind since  the strike was the last that babbitt oversaw as head of the union because he stepped down at the end of    babbitt left the union in  to found eclat

competitive airline industry which supported deregulation of the airline industry and the faa management advisory council in  he was named by transportation secretary mary peters to an independent review team of aviation and safety experts tasked with evaluating and crafting recommendations to improve the faa’s implementation of the aviation safety system and its culture of safety that effort yielded the report “managing risks in civil aviation a review of the faa’s approach to safety”   industry observers say babbitt’s first priority as head of faa is likely to be settling a longrunning battle between the agency and its airtraffic controllers the two sides have been at odds over pay scales and work rules since  when the faa imposed pay cuts on new hires dress codes and other workplace restrictions following a period of acrimonious negotiations another goal will be to break the political logjam blocking deployment of the nextgeneration trafficcontrol system touted as the best cure for the chronic delays plaguing air travel the new system isn’t currently scheduled to be fully operational before  and such a long transition concerns lawmakers and industry airlines have balked at making expensive technology upgrades to their cockpits saying they need more proof of future benefits   outside of his professional work babbitt has volunteered for the boy scouts of america

fairfax city general district court judge ian o’flaherty ended the trial soon after it began after video of the traffic stop was played in court the judge said the officer had pulled babbitt over on a “mere hunch” the video showed babbitt making a routine lefthand turn into a fairfax city business complex from the southbound lane of old lee highway in the process babbitt crossed double yellow lines and a northbound lane but he did not drive on the wrong side of the road as fairfax city officer mike morris alleged in the criminal complaint defense attorney peter greenspun also said the first breath test given to babbitt showed that he had a bloodalcohol level of  below virginia’s legal limit of  a prosecutor said in court that later tests showed babbitt exceeding the legal limit but the
