characteristics of a business are far more important than its size we prefer to operate across the full market capitalization spectrum and invest in companies that are market leaders of an industry niche within these companies we look for worldclass management teams with superior execution skills who deliver on a consistent basis in varied environments we prefer managements that do not draw large salaries but rather have meaningful equity positions in their companies by adhering to our disciplines of primary research objective valuation analysis and patience we have been able to achieve superior and consistent returns in managed portfolios we firmly believe that the constant application of these disciplines protects our portfolios from the temptation of buying into investment fads
