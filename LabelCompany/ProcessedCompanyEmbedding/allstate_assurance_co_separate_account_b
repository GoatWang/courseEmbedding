values due to the different charges imposed under those contracts each of the allstate contracts and northbrook contracts also offer one or more general account options that are not registered under the  act d northbrook mva contracts the northbrook mva contracts are flexible premium deferred fixed annuity contracts that are offered to individuals and to eligible groups they have no variable investment options northbrook holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for and its other liabilities with respect to the northbrook mva contracts in a nonunitized separate account that is not registered under the  act market value adjustment interests in the northbrook mva contracts are registered under the  act e underwriter msdw a wholly owned subsidiary of morgan stanley dean witter  co is the principal underwriter for the northbrook contracts msdw was organized under the laws of delaware in  msdw is registered with the commission under the securities and exchange act of  as a brokerdealer and is a member of the new york stock exchange and the national association of securities dealers inc ii the proposed transactions a the merger northbrook will merge with and into allstate with allstate as the surviving corporation pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger and articles of merger collectively the merger agreement approved by the boards of directors of allstate and northbrook the merger is subject to approval by the insurance departments of arizona and illinois the states of domicile for northbrook and allstate respectively allstate and northbrook expect to consummate the merger including the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer on or about january   the effective date as a result of the merger allstate will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of the northbrook separate accounts and will become directly liable for northbrooks liabilities and obligations with respect to the northbrook contracts then outstanding each northbrook contract owner will become a contract owner of allstate by operation of law the merger will not affect the provisions of or the rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts moreover the merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the northbrook contracts nor will the merger affect the values determined under the northbrook contracts the merger will not affect any current allstate contract owners no charges will be imposed on or other deductions made from the northbrook separate accounts or allstate separate account i in connection with the merger in addition no payments will be required or charges imposed under the northbrook contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed no new investment options will be made available to owners of the northbrook contracts in connection with or by virtue of the merger nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated each subaccount of the northbrook separate accounts will continue to invest in the same underlying fund as that subaccount invested in prior to the merger the merger will not directly affect any of the underlying funds the underlying funds will not be a party to the merger or any related transaction the investment objectives policies and restrictions of the underlying funds will not be changed as a result of the merger or any related transaction no investment portfolios are proposed to be added to substituted by or terminated by the underlying funds in connection with the merger or any related transaction moreover the merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the underlying funds the underlying funds assets or the charges imposed on the underlying funds or their shareholders in addition the merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the northbrook contracts allstate and northbrook have determined that no provision of the northbrook contracts or state law provides the owners of those contracts northbrook contract owners with any right to optout of or to vote on or otherwise consent to the merger rather the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies moreover none of the events affecting the northbrook separate accounts in connection with the merger require a vote of northbrook contract owners under the  act in addition as described above the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the northbrook contracts will not change except that allstate will become the depositor of the northbrook separate accounts consequently northbrook contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the merger after the merger allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred northbrook contracts outstanding at the time the merger is effected and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the northbrook contracts currently being offered but for the change in depositor allstate will administer the northbrook contracts in the same manner as did northbrook immediately prior to the merger all costs of the merger will be borne by allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of northbrook or allstate contracts each a contract owner and collectively the contract owners b the separate account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook life separate account will transfer intact to allstate and become part of allstate on the effective date it will change its name to allstate life variable life separate account a and have allstate as its depositor rather than northbrook no other changes to northbrook life separate account will result from the merger the assets and liabilities that comprise northbrook life separate account immediately prior to the merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of allstate as the surviving company after the merger in addition northbrook life separate account will continue to fund the same contracts it did immediately prior to the merger c the separate account mergers pursuant to the merger agreement the northbrook va accounts will merge with allstate separate account i on the effective date to achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings allstate will consolidate any duplicative subaccounts that invest in the same underlying fund the consolidation of the subaccounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each northbrook contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging subaccounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving subaccount the values of the exchanged interests under the contracts will thus be equivalent the accumulation unit values for these subaccounts will not change and the contract value of any affected contract owner immediately after the subaccount consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the subaccount consolidation the separate account mergers will not affect the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts that are not duplicative those subaccounts will remain intact within allstate separate account i and their net asset values immediately after the merger will be the same as they were immediately before the merger d the fixed account transfer pursuant to the merger agreement northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts to allstate and allstate will assume northbrooks obligations under such contracts on the effective date as a result of the merger each nonunitized separate account of northbrook that funds the northbrook mva contracts will become a nonunitized separate account of allstate at the same time allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of northbrook under the northbrook mva contracts issued prior to the merger the fixed account transfer will not change the terms of the northbrook mva contracts except for the succession of allstate as the insurer under the northbrook mva contracts and it will not adversely affect the values determined under or the economic interests of the owners of those contracts e procedural matters allstate will file new registration statements on form n or form n as applicable under the  act to reflect the change in depositor of the northbrook separate accounts and allstates assumption pursuant to the merger of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook under the northbrook va contracts and northbrook vli contract allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date existing northbrook contract owners other than northbrook vli contract owners will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstates sponsorship of the northbrook separate accounts as a result of the merger new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor northbrook vli contract owners will receive a new form n prospectus that reflects the change in depositor allstate also will file new registration statements on form s under the  act for the northbrook mva contracts allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the effective date these new registration statements would reflect allstates assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of northbrook with respect to the northbrook mva contracts pursuant to the merger each person who owns a northbrook mva contract at the time of the fixed account transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects allstate as the issuer of the contract new contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer in compliance with applicable state law allstate and northbrook will notify the owners of the northbrook contracts that allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of northbrook under those contracts following the effective date allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the northbrook contracts until the new registration statements filed with the commission are effective iii discussion for the reasons discussed below we are of the view that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the proposed transactions we also are of the view as discussed below that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and that section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers finally we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to northbrook and other named parties prior to the merger may continue to be relied upon after the merger by allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications the staff has responded favorably to noaction requests dealing with the provisions of the  act and the  act noted above regarding transactions similar to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer we respectfully submit that the proposed transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those noaction requests a section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer the separate account mergers or the fixed account transfer  separate account transfer in our view the separate account transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account transfer would not change the northbrook vli contracts except that by operation of law allstate would succeed northbrook as the depositor of northbrook life separate account and coissuer of the contracts and would accordingly guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the contracts these rights and benefits eg surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by allstates larger pool of assets cash values under the northbrook vli contracts that are allocated to the northbrook life separate account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the separate account and its subaccounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the unit values under the northbrook vli contracts offered by allstate life variable life separate account a immediately after the separate account transfer would be the same as under the contracts offered by northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer therefore would not affect those aspects of the northbrook vli contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities eg the investment options available through the separate account the separate account transfer would have no effect on the northbrook life separate account except for the succession of allstate as depositor and coissuer described above and except for the change in name of that separate account to allstate life variable life separate account a the assets and liabilities that comprise the northbrook life separate account immediately before the separate account transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of allstate the financial history of the northbrook life separate account would be carried forward and with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by allstate would not change as discussed above contract owners will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the merger including the separate account transfer and will not by virtue of the merger have available any new or different investment options consequently contract owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the separate account transfer based on the foregoing we believe that section  of the  act and rule  thereunder do not apply to the separate account transfer  separate account mergers in our view the separate account mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act and rule  thereunder the separate account mergers would not result in any change to the northbrook va contracts except that allstate would succeed northbrook as depositor and as coissuer of the contracts the rights and benefits under the northbrook va contracts would remain the same all of the subaccounts of the northbrook va accounts would continue to invest in the same underlying funds the northbrook va contract values immediately following the merger will be the same as immediately before and contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the merger the change in depositor following the merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding the identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations for example the depositor in effect guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required regardless of whether the relevant contracts account value has already been depleted thereby we respectfully submit therefore that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the northbrook contracts rather than to those aspects of the contracts that constitute or cause the contracts to be securities this argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security moreover even if the separate account mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of new or different securities such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of section  or rule  because contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the separate account mergers accordingly the contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an offer or sale to occur that would bring section  into play nor in this case will there be the kind of security holder action that under the terms of the rule is required to bring rule  into play  fixed account transfer in our view the fixed account transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of section  of the  act no change will be made to the northbrook mva contracts by virtue of the fixed account transfer except that allstate will succeed northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the northbrook mva contracts these rights and benefits ie surrender rights annuity options death benefits etc will remain the same northbrook will transfer its nonunitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the northbrook mva contracts intact to allstate consequently when the fixed account transfer becomes effective allstate will hold these assets in the same nonunitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer as discussed above owners of northbrook mva contracts will not have the opportunity to optout of or to vote on or consent to the fixed account transfer and will not by virtue of the fixed account transfer have available any new or different investment options consequently owners of northbrook mva contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the fixed account transfer b section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer in our view the succession of allstate to the position of depositor for the northbrook life separate account as a result of the merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to section  of the  act the merger will cause a change in the depositor of the northbrook life separate account which will involve a change in the coissuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that separate account however the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the northbrook life separate account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the northbrook vli contracts or to the contract owners the northbrook life separate account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes including financial reporting the commissions ectoplasmic theory in our view supports the position that northbrook life separate account as such will have a continuing uninterrupted existence notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets although the assets of northbrook life separate account will become assets of allstate such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account and for financial reporting purposes the separate account will be treated as a continuing separate entity accordingly to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the northbrook life separate account from northbrook to allstate following the consummation of the merger allstate and the separate account will file a new registration statement on form n that will constitute an amendment to the separate accounts existing registration under the  act the form n registration statement also will register under the  act any securities transactions effected under the northbrook vli contracts after the merger allstate will file the form n registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the merger c section  of the  act does not apply to the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers based on the foregoing analysis we also believe that the separate account transfer does not involve an exchange of securities the separate account interests in the northbrook vli contracts issued by an investment company the northbrook vli separate account for securities of any other investment company for purposes of section  of the  act in addition for the reasons discussed above we believe that the separate account mergers do not involve an offer of exchange within the meaning of section  however should the separate account transfer or the separate account mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of section  we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of section a and rule ab thereunder because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values thus commission approval of such transactions should not be required under section  of the  act d continued reliance on prior exemptive relief is appropriate we believe the exemptions under the  act that northbrook the northbrook separate accounts and the other parties named therein have received from the commission or its staff should continue to apply after the merger to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and other parties named therein to the extent they continue to be relied upon without the filing with the commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief their continued applicability is appropriate because the merger will not change the operations of allstate separate account i nor its relationship to its depositor any other separate account or contract owners the only changes resulting from the merger are i the substitution of allstate for northbrook as depositor for the northbrook separate accounts and as coissuer and insurer of the northbrook contracts ii the transfer of the subaccounts of the northbrook separate accounts to allstate separate account i iii the transfer of northbrook life separate account to allstate and iv the consolidation of the transferred subaccounts that invest in the same underlying funds it is our view that such changes have no impact upon and are not relevant to the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions in support of our view we note that the commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several noaction letters iv noaction request based upon the above facts and circumstances we respectfully request that the commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the commission take any enforcement action under section  of the  act and rule  thereunder in connection with the merger including the separate account transfer the separate account mergers and the fixed account transfer or under section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and section  of the  act in connection with the separate account transfer and the separate account mergers in addition we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein to the extent they continue to be relied upon will continue to be applicable after the effective date in the manner described above to allstate allstate separate account i allstate life variable life separate account a and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions for the same assurance if you have any questions or require

other investment option under the contracts is the company’s general account which pays a fixed rate of interest ‘‘fixed account’’ as of verdate sep  feb   jkt  september   there were a total of  individual contract owners only  of whom were invested in the separate account contract owners may transfer account assets between the fixed account and the separate account but only once every  months  redemptions have significantly reduced the separate account’s assets over the past decade and are likely to continue notwithstanding any positive investment performance that may result in a net increase in the separate account’s assets as of september   the separate account had approximately  in total net assets  the public offering of the contracts under the securities act of  ‘‘securities act’’ was initially registered in  file no – the company discontinued the sale of new contracts in  although the contracts allow contract owners to make additional contributions the company has not received an additional contribution under the contracts since november  which was allocated to the fixed account no contributions or transfers have been allocated to the separate

 applicants respectfully request that the commission pursuant to section c of the act issue an order granting an exemption from all provisions of the act subject to the conditions set out in section iii below applicants believe based on the grounds set out in the application that the requested exemption meets the standards of section c of the act  section c of the act authorizes the commission to ‘‘conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person security or transaction or any class or classes of persons securities or transactions from the provisions of the act or of any rule or regulation thereunder if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act’’  applicants believe that the requested exemption is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act section c of the act makes clear that congress intended to exclude from the po  frm  fmt  sfmt  act entities in which there is no significant public interest as noted above only  individual beneficial owners are currently invested in the separate account well below the  person limit of section c in addition the company discontinued the sale of new contracts in  likewise the separate account has not received any additional contract owner money in over a decade no salesperson is engaged in any solicitation or marketing activity with respect to the contracts or the separate account and no compensation is being paid for any such activity the company has no intention of offering the contracts to new purchasers or encouraging any investments in the separate account and will not do so if the order is granted although the terms and conditions of the contracts permit contract owners to make future allocations to or investments in the separate account applicants assert that the separate account’s historical experience strongly suggests that the likelihood of receiving any such allocation or investment is remote  in addition applicants state that contract owners do not need the protections afforded by the act applicants assert that contract owners are adequately protected by the fact that their longstanding relationship with the company of over  years is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts which may not be changed without contract owner approval except where permitted or required by applicable law the contracts among other things fix the fees and charges including management fees associated with the separate account thus distinguishing the separate account from mutual funds whose expenses can change periodically the contracts also confer upon owners the right to receive at least annually a statement a reflecting the investment results for the prior year b listing the investments of the separate account as of the date of the statement and c reflecting the value of the accumulation units credited to the contracts moreover after the date of the order requested by the application applicants will provide contract owners with annual audited financial statements of the company and the separate account pursuant to proposed condition  described below in addition the contracts are governed by and administered according to state  hr rep no – at   s rep no – at   ‘‘section c was intended to exclude from the act private companies in which there is no significant public interest and which are therefore not appropriate subjects of federal regulation’’ efrfmfensgm fen federal register  vol  no   thursday february    notices mstockstill on dskgtprod with notices insurance law which requires that the company maintain in the separate account assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the separate account that the income gains and losses realized or unrealized from assets allocated to the separate account be credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income gains or losses of the company and that assets of the separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the separate account not be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct furthermore the requested relief would be subject to the other conditions described in section iii below  applicants state that there is very little contract owner interest in the separate account the last time a premium was received under a contract was in november  and the last time a premium or transfer was allocated to the separate account was in  the separate account’s assets have been declining due to redemptions over the past decade and are likely to continue to decline as the result of redemptions  applicants maintain that granting the requested relief would enable applicants to avoid the difficulties of trying to efficiently manage the separate account in compliance with the diversification and other requirements of the act as assets dwindle down to zero further applicants assert that granting the requested relief would enable applicants to avoid the significant ongoing legal accounting and other costs of maintaining a registered investment company which costs currently exceed the amount of revenues generated by the fees under the contracts  applicants submit that the relief is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act iii conditions applicants consent to the following conditions to any order issued by the commission  the company will continue to be responsible for satisfying all the obligations to contract owners as specified under the terms of their contracts in addition promptly after the issuance of the notice of the application the company will deliver a written document to all contract owners that will state that the notice has been issued that consequently after the verdate sep  feb   jkt  order granting the relief requested in the notice is issued certain legal protections afforded to contract owners allocating assets to an investment company registered under the act no longer apply to them that nevertheless the terms and conditions of such contracts have not changed and that the company continues to be responsible for satisfying all the obligations to such contract owners as specified under the terms of their contracts in the event a contract owner transfers money from the fixed account to the separate account the company and the separate account will notify such transferring contract owner that the separate account is no longer a separate account registered under the act and provide the contract owner a onetime opportunity to transfer the money back into the fixed account prior to the  month holding period required by the contracts any subsequent transfer by the same contract owner from the fixed account to the separate account will be subject to the  month holding period required by the contracts  the company will continue to be responsible for maintaining records of the values under each owner’s contract providing quarterly statements and transaction confirmations to contract owners and all other administrative functions in connection with the separate account as in the past the company may retain one or more administrators to provide such services but the company will remain ultimately responsible therefor  the separate account will at all times continue to be operated in the manner contemplated by rule –e and  under the act specifically a the separate account will continue to be an account established and maintained by an insurance company pursuant to the laws of a state or territory of the united states under which income gains and losses whether or not realized from assets allocated to the separate account are in accordance with the contracts credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income gains or losses of the insurance company b the separate account shall be legally segregated and the assets of the separate account will at the time during the year that adjustments in the reserves are made have a value at least equal to the company’s reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the separate account and at all other times will have a value approximately equal to or in excess of such reserves and liabilities and po  frm  fmt  sfmt   c that portion of the separate account’s assets having a value equal to such reserves and contract liabilities will not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business that the company may conduct  the company and the separate account will operate in compliance with applicable state insurance law including but not limited to filing annual audited financial statements of the company and the separate account with the insurance department of the company’s domiciliary state  the company will provide contract owners invested in the separate account with copies of the annual audited financial statements of the company and the separate account  the company and the separate account will not solicit additional contributions from contract owners or resume the sale of contracts and will not use the separate account to issue any other annuity contracts that would require the separate account to be registered under the act unless so registered in addition the company and the separate account will not solicit transfers from the fixed account into the separate account furthermore the separate account will not be used for any other business other than as a funding vehicle for the contracts  the separate account will reregister under the act should the number of beneficial owners invested in the separate account exceed   the separate account will continue to create maintain and keep current the books and records as set forth in rules a– and a– under the act for the periods specified by these rules iv conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above and in the application applicants submit that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the act and that the commission therefore should grant the

appropriate subjects of federal regulation   in addition applicants state that contract owners do not need the protections afforded by the act applicants assert that contract owners are adequately protected by the fact that their longstanding relationship with the company of over  years is established by the terms and conditions of the contracts which may not be changed without contract owner approval except where permitted or required by applicable law the contracts among other things fix the fees and charges including management fees associated with the separate account thus distinguishing the separate account from mutual funds whose expenses can change periodically the contracts also confer upon owners the right to receive at least annually a statement a reflecting the investment results for the prior year b listing the investments of the separate account as of the date of the statement and c reflecting the value of the accumulation units credited to the contracts moreover after the date of the order requested by the application applicants will provide contract owners with annual audited financial statements of the company and the separate account pursuant to proposed condition  described below in addition the contracts are governed by and administered according to state page  insurance law which requires that the company maintain in the separate account assets with a value at least equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the separate account that the income gains and losses realized or unrealized from assets allocated to the separate account be credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income gains or losses of the company and that assets of the separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the separate account not be charged with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct furthermore the requested relief would be subject to the other conditions described in section iii below  applicants state that there is very little contract owner interest in the separate account the last time a premium was received under a contract was in november  and the last time a premium or transfer was allocated to the separate account was in  the separate accounts assets have been declining due to redemptions over the past decade and are likely to continue to decline as the result of redemptions  applicants maintain that granting the requested relief would enable applicants to avoid the difficulties of trying to efficiently manage the separate account in compliance with the diversification and other requirements of the act as assets dwindle down to zero further applicants assert that granting the requested relief would enable applicants to avoid the significant ongoing legal accounting and other costs of maintaining a registered investment company which costs currently exceed the amount of revenues generated by the fees under the contracts  applicants submit that the relief is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act iii conditions applicants consent to the following conditions to any order issued by the commission  the company will continue to be responsible for satisfying all the obligations to contract owners as specified under the terms of their contracts in addition promptly after the issuance of the notice of the application the company will deliver a written document to all contract owners that will state that the notice has been issued that consequently after the order granting the relief requested in the notice is issued certain legal protections afforded to contract owners allocating assets to an investment company registered under the act no longer apply to them that nevertheless the terms and conditions of such contracts have not changed and that the company continues to be responsible for satisfying all the obligations to such contract owners as specified under the terms of their contracts in the event a contract owner transfers money from the fixed account to the separate account the company and the separate account will notify such transferring contract owner that the separate account is no longer a separate account registered under the act and provide the contract owner a onetime opportunity to transfer the money back into the fixed account prior to the  month holding period required by the contracts any subsequent transfer by the same contract owner from the fixed account to the separate account will be subject to the  month holding period required by the contracts  the company will continue to be responsible for maintaining records of the values under each owners contract providing quarterly statements and transaction confirmations to contract owners and all other administrative functions in connection with the separate account as in the past the company may retain one or more administrators to provide such services but the company will remain ultimately responsible therefor  the separate account will at all times continue to be operated in the manner contemplated by rule e and  under the act specifically a the separate account will continue to be an account established and maintained by an insurance company pursuant to the laws of a state or territory of the united states under which income gains and losses whether or not realized from assets allocated to the separate account are in accordance with the contracts credited to or charged against the separate account without regard to other income gains or losses of the insurance company b the separate account shall be legally segregated and the assets of the separate account will at the time during the year that adjustments in the reserves are made have a value at least equal to the companys reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the separate account and at all other times will have a value approximately equal to or in excess of such reserves and liabilities and c that portion of the separate accounts assets having a value equal to such reserves and contract liabilities will not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business that the company may conduct  the company and the separate account will operate in compliance with applicable state insurance law including but not limited to filing annual audited financial statements of the company and the separate account with the insurance department of the companys domiciliary state  the company will provide contract owners invested in the separate account with copies of the annual audited financial statements of the company and the separate account  the company and the separate account will not solicit additional contributions from contract owners or resume the sale of contracts and will not use the separate account to issue any other annuity contracts that would require the separate account to be registered under the act unless so registered in addition the company and the separate account will not solicit transfers from the fixed account into the separate account furthermore the separate account will not be used for any other business other than as a funding vehicle for the contracts  the separate account will reregister under the act should the number of beneficial owners invested in the separate account exceed   the separate account will continue to create maintain and keep current the books and records as set forth in rules a and a under the act for the periods specified by these rules iv conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above and in the application applicants submit that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the act and that the commission therefore should grant the requested order for the commission by the division of investment management pursuant to delegated authority eduardo a aleman

from good hands to boxing glovesedit this is the title of a book written by david berardinelli jd michael freeman phd dc mph and aaron deshaw dc jd with a foreword by eugene r anderson the book relates profitboosting strategies that consulting firm mckinsey  company presented to allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim mckinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for fortune  companies including controversial clients such as enron to maximize profits mckinsey’s recommendation to allstate according to berardinelli was to lowball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment allstate would offer its good hands in the way of a lowball claim and if the customer did not accept to get out boxing gloves  the book was reviewed by business week magazine according to that article allstate responded to berardinellis allegations by claiming that berardinellis allegations were unfounded and unproven rather than trying to cheat customers the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying exaggerated and fraudulent claims and that its processes are absolutely sound    to investigate evaluate and promptly resolve each claim fairly based on the merits court decisions on the issues debated by berardinelli and allstate have gone both ways according to the business week article as of  courts and regulators in a
