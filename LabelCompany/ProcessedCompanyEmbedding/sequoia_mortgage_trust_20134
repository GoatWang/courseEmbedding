believes the results of the review generally indicate strong underwriting controls originators with limited performance history the majority of the pool was originated by lenders with limited nonagency performance history the lack of performance history is partially mitigated by the  thirdparty diligence conducted on these loans that resulted in immaterial findings fitch also considers the credit enhancement ce on this transaction sufficient to mitigate the originator risk geographically diverse pool the collateral pool is geographically diverse the percentage in the top three metropolitan statistical areas msas is  and concentration in california is  similar to recent semt transactions the agency did not apply a default penalty to the pool due to the low geographic concentration risk transaction provisions enhance deal framework the representation warranty and enforcement mechanism framework is viewed positively as it is consistent with fitch criteria as in

those projected by fitchs shp model for this region the sensitivity analysis indicated no impact on ratings for all bonds in each scenario in its analysis fitch considered placing a greater emphasis on recent economic performance in determining market value declines while fitchs current loan loss model looks to three years of historical data and one year of projections this does not incorporate recent notable economic improvement to reflect the more recent economic environment a sensitivity analysis was performed using two years of historical economic data and two years of projections the result of this sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss expectations for this transaction this sensitivity analysis resulted in a base smvd of  slightly less than the  base smvd projected in the current model another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings would react to steeper mvds at the national level the analysis assumes mvds of   and  in
