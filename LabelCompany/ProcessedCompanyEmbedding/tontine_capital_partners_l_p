sgr trn fwltbreakdown tontine partners f can be summed up in  words regional bank mess he has a ton of them but they arent very big positions relative to his whole portfolio for the most part though gendell was selling all his financials including the regionals the only major financial plays he has left anyways are smaller positions and his only positions of major size in that sector are through calls so id have to think that he saved himself some serious money by exitingreducing a number of those regional positions as they could have really put him in the house of pain it should be noted that he made large additions to the big banks such as jpm and gsthe next major trend i noticed in his portfolio was that he is highly levered up with steel holdings while he did do some position size reducing across a few of his steel names x aks one still has to wonder how hes faring right now given the recent selloff in steel whether he has sold anymore substantial positions is the real question because if he hasnt the recent drop in steel stocks has undoubtedly affected his portfolio in a negative way although he did reduce his position sizes he still has massive stakes in the steel names after all the top  holdings of his fund and  out of the top  holdings as of june th were steel stocks so he definitely profited handsomely from these steel names by nearly topticking the market selling huge chunks before the peak in july but hes since given back much of these gains assumming he still holds the steel names this is actually a very unique situation where his f doesnt really help us these holdings were as of june th and that was conveniently around the same time steel stocks started topping out so the real action in the steel names has been occuring outside of the time period the f covers ie the past month and a half and he is either taking a lot of pain from these massive steel holdings or he has been partly responsible for the massive selloff in the steel names we can only guess at this point well have to wait until the next round of filings to find out what hes been up to unfortunately the timing overlap on this situation really prevents us from gaining much insightbut from this past quarter we can take away the fact that gendell definitely had strong conviction in steel and infrastructure names after all practically all of his top  holdings are concentrated in those  sectors one other top  holding i wanted to touch on though is his  holding quanta services pwr this chart has been breaking out and i have seen this name popping up more and more around financial sites plus it fits right into his whole infrastructure theme so it doesnt surprise me at all to see that gendell has already been in this name for quite some time after all hes a pretty smart guy keep in mind although some of these top holdings are indeed large stakes somemany have experienced price appreciation boosting their  share of the portfolio even moretontine partners most interesting moves whatever he has done in the past month and a half that we cant see no joke since such a massive allocation of his portfolio was dedicated to steel stocks his funds performance has no doubt been affected by whatever decisions he has made recently if he has been one of the many selling steel names then he is in great shape if not then hes screwed us plebeians will have to wait until the next round of fs to find out gendells steel fatef source secguest post by market follyfree daily hedge fund newsletterrelated to tontine capital partnersgeographical hedge fund
