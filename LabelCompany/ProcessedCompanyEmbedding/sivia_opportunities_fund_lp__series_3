industry takes a page from apples book • vaporizer companies are seeing huge growth as more states legalize marijuana• as the industry grows the technology is becoming more hightech chris morris  morrisatlarge thursday  apr    pm etcnbccom shares robyn beck  afp  getty images a man calling himself henry hemp inhales marijuana using a vaporizer pen at hempcon medical marijuana show as more states legalize medical and recreational marijuana the pot culture is spawning some big side industries vaporizers which were already seeing growth from people shifting away from traditional cigarettes have seen a sales surge as cannabis legalization has spread widely used by marijuana enthusiasts vapes have historically been lowcost lowtech products but many in the industry are now adopting business models that are more in line with tech giants like apple samsung and sony as a means to grow sales on april  the unofficial appreciation day for marijuana and a black fridaylike event for vape manufacturers it might first help to get a sense of the size of the vape market exact numbers are tough to come by because manufacturers are privately held most vaporizers are sold either directly from company websites or in tobacco and vapor shops where groups like nielsen have limited tracking while there are some outlandish claims putting the market in the  billionplus range that seems unlikely the winstonsalem journal estimated vaporizer sales excluding ecigarettes would hit  billion last year namaste technologies a leading internet marketer of vaporizers and accessories has predicted it will generate revenue of  million canadian  million us this fiscal year and  million canadian  million us for the fiscal year ending august   it expects revenues to increase  percent each year through  top vape manufacturers though say theyre seeing annual growth rates of several hundred percent year over year a big part of that is the decision by many to aggressively market highend highdollar products that feature regular upgrades show chapters year of the vape    monday  jan    am et   i think the reason youre seeing more premium vaporizers on the market is because its getting more competitive said pantelis ataliotis president of dr dabber its getting tougher to stand out in the crowd  with a standard vaporizer theres always room for great innovation said tyler goldman ceo at leading vaporizer manufacturer pax labs like in any typical tech business the top companies are likely to be the few who have better offerings consumers migrate quickly to the best products its a strategy thats luring investors in  san franciscobased pax announced it had closed a  million series c funding round with fidelity management  research company and sivia capital among the investors pax says that it has sold more than  million of its pax  pax  and pax  devices which sell for up to  last september the company released pax era a  product for people who prefer to consume liquids or oils the era already has a  percent share of the market in colorado goldman said over at kandypens another vape company sales increased  percent last year to  million founder and ceo graham gibson said the company aims to cross  million this year rather than relying on word of mouth for sales as some vape companies do kandypens aggressively markets its products to consumers its run fullpage ads in publications like rolling stone and snagged celebrity endorsements with the likes of dj khaled kandypens follows apples example of offering new products each year some  to  percent of the companys existing customers upgrade when those roll out even if the products arent dramatically different gibson said last march we launched the gravity this year in january we launched the elite its the same pen with a different finish and a different name — and we charged  more per unit gibson said once people are sold on a brand theyll buy whatever product you have coming out and theyll give their old product to a friend the growth rate at dr dabber has been just as impressive ataliotis estimates a sales increase of  percent to  percent over the past two years and while he wont make that same prediction for upcoming years hes optimistic about the growth potential because this industry is so new there are so many opportunities to make new products he said its not like everything that can be thought up has been thought up  whats out on the market is for the most part all the same theres a lot of room for innovation the market territory for vape companies is also expanding rapidly as more states pass marijuana laws that has some manufacturers considering options like an initial public offering ataliotis says thats an idea dr dabber toys with frequently though no plans are imminent weve been approached about it ataliotis said were very dynamic and good at adapting to whats going on  it would definitely be something wed consider watch simplifying the pot
