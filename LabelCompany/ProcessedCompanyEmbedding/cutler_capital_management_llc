plus discipline at cutler we believe that longterm riskadjusted performance is best achieved by combining the judgment of seasoned portfolio managers with the discipline of a welldefined investment process our security selection utilizes a five step bottomup approach that starts with a proprietary screen to generate ideas followed by detailed structural credit and fundamental analysis to complete our understanding of the securities value and risks our investment strategies all start with a core portfolio of convertible securities depending on the investment mandate and risk profile we then adjust the emphasis toward capital preservation or toward growth while our strategies range from relatively aggressive to more defensive the basic tenets of our investment philosophy remain the same across all of our portfolios identify value we look for convertibles and underlying equities that appear to be undervalued this sets the stage for capital appreciation and longterm outperformance without undue risk to principle capitalize on “positive asymmetry” certain convertibles have structural features that give them an advantageous riskreturn profile  in essence these securities can have significant upside potential yet still have strong downside protection  in our investment process we screen the global convertible universe for issues with low conversion premiums attractive yields and short maturities  we look for candidates that have a delta a measure of sensitivity to stock prices that is between  –  we typically avoid busted or deepinthemoney convertibles balance risk and reward we constantly monitor and evaluate riskreward profiles at the individual security level and at the portfolio level we also look for potential catalysts that could change our level of conviction towards any particular position taking profits and limiting losses is an important part of our discipline especially in our more conservative portfolios invest in what we know we perform our own credit market and interestrate research  we track securities and companies over time and develop a history with the issuer that is invaluable to our assessment of the investment potential of each security buy for the longterm by the nature of our investment process we favor strong companies with solid longterm prospects and we manage our portfolios for longterm appreciation  at the same time when we do trade we strive to be opportunistic in order to generate incremental performance commit to performance for our clients our focus is on delivering performance for our clients not on gathering the largest amount of assets  limiting assets under management has two key advantages it lets us manage portfolios that are composed exclusively of our “best ideas” and it lets us operate in sectors of the market that larger firms typically overlook  our investment approach is truly one that is designed to exploit the advantages of being a niche player in a growing yet still inefficient
