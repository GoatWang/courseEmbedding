street coons leaves wall street associates to launch hedge fund erin arvedlund apr  9  pm edt richard coons who made a name for himself as an early adopter among the streets technologyfocused money managers has left smallcap investor wall street associates to start a hedge fund before joining wall street associates in  coons was a topranked money manager for the  atebx alliance technology fund getting an early jump on the technology boom fueling the latest bull market his no  semiconductor stock pick in 9 according to a september fortune magazine issue intel  intc coons who had worked at wall street associates for  years alongside founders kenneth mccain and william jeff jeffery resigned last month vincent stefano who helped market the firm left with coons to open the new company catering to highnetworth individuals endowments and some institutional money coons yearold son mark joins his fathers new firm as a principal as well we always knew rich wanted to work with his kids says mccain the departure of coons  shows that hedge funds investment partnerships closed to all but the very wealthy continue to braindrain talent away from traditional moneymanagement firms for instance jon jacobson a star stockpicker left harvard management last year to open his own hedge fund highfield capital and john brennan and chris felipe left mfs investment management last month to set up a hedge fund according to published reports not only does the hedge fund format allow coons and stefano to break out from smallcap to allcap investing it could also allow them to make more money if the firm performs well the new firm viewpoint investment partners will charge the steep but standard hedge fund tithe of and or  management fees and  performance fees coons says meanwhile jeffery and mccain are staying at wall street associates a micro and smallcap growth manager they founded in 9  days before the stock market crashed wall street associates is a subadviser to the sei investments umbrella of funds it also has its own hedge funds wall street associates opened for business with about  million under management and within two years coons joined the firm from alliance wall street associates now manages about  billion some for corporate pensions and advisers such as sei and salomon smith barney and roughly  million in its two separate hedge funds mccain says however wall street associates specializes in smallcap emerginggrowth companies which have lagged in the market rush into bluechips freed of those smallcap handcuffs coons and stefano say their performance could be stronger in a pure smallcap or microcap account you have capitalization limits and its hard to find a good internet company for example with a capitalization less than  billion thats somewhat limiting coons says well focus less on just smallcap stocks and probably with a more aggressive use of shorting or making bets that certain stocks will fall when the coonsmccainjeffery trio was still a trio wall street associates managed a  return last year investors pay premium prices for hedgefund management and in return of course they expect superior performance which most of them didnt get in  the average hedge fund returned  last year while the benchmark sp  index returned  leaving many investors scratching their heads over why they paid a  performance fee for mediocre returns if you
