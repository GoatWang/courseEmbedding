officer of piedmont trust company a private north carolina trust company mr shields has over  years of investment and business experience including extensive experience in the financial sector  the board believes that each directors experience qualifications attributes and skills should be evaluated on an individual basis and in consideration of the perspective such director brings to the entire board with no single director or particular factor being indicative of board effectiveness however the board believes that directors need to have the ability to critically review evaluate question and discuss information provided to them and to interact effectively with fund management service providers and counsel in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties the board believes that their members satisfy this standard experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a directors educational background business professional training or practice public service or academic positions experience from service as a board member including the board or as an executive of investment funds public companies or significant private or nonprofit entities or other organizations andor other life experiences the charter for the boards nominating committee contains certain other specific factors considered by the nominating committee in identifying and selecting director candidates as described below to assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law the directors are counseled by their own independent legal counsel who participates in board meetings and interacts with ra and also may benefit from information provided by ras internal counsel both board and ras internal counsel have significant experience advising funds and fund board members the board and its committees have the ability to engage other experts as appropriate the board evaluates its performance on an annual basis board composition and leadership structure the investment company act requires that at least  of the funds directors not be interested persons as defined in the investment company act of the fund and as such are not affiliated with ra independent directors to rely on certain exemptive rules under the investment company act a majority of the funds directors must be independent directors and for certain important matters such as the approval of investment advisory agreements or transactions with affiliates the investment company act or the rules thereunder require the approval of a majority of the independent directors currently more than  of the funds directors are independent directors the board does not have a chairman but the president an interested person of the fund acts as chairman at the board meetings the independent directors have not designated a lead independent director but the chairman of the audit committee mr mehlman generally acts as chairman of meetings or executive sessions of the independent directors and when appropriate represents the views of the independent directors to management the board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate in light of the services that royce and its affiliates provide to the fund and potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships  audit committee report the board
