never survive in any other industry  so why does it plague the largest sector of the united states economy  there are a myriad of reasons  with surgeons hospitals anesthesiologists physical therapists and primary care physicians often being managed by different organizations breakdown in communication with a patient is extremely likely this fragmentation results in an increased likelihood of duplicative testing and ultimately more cost as patients become more responsible for paying for their health care through highdeductible health plans they end up having to pay for that waste to make matters worse patients currently receive bills from all the disparate parties mentioned above it’s no surprise that patients have no idea what the “real” cost of a procedure is when they leave their physician’s office  moreover are they aware of why a procedure is being performed at a hospital instead of an outpatient surgery center how does it work in a contessa health bundled payment program the physician is responsible for the quality and cost of care a patient receives the best way to achieve highquality outcomes in an efficient manner is to have someone involved throughout the entire episode managing those disconnected care providers – a care coordinator when the decision is made to have surgery our care coordinators are there to help the patient through the entire episode they will be there to answer any questions the patient may have as it relates to what they are experiencing who will be involved and where care will take place furthermore the procedure has a predetermined rate – for the entire episode the patient will not be burdened by receiving multiple bills  they will receive one bill for the entire episode of care and will have the peace of mind of knowing exactly what it will cost before deciding to move forward with surgery the complexities of bundled payments  who manages  what’s included which site is most appropriate what does the episode include how long is the episode of care how much should it cost  competing interests complex ecosystems associated with traditional bundled programs result in high implementation costs difficulty with care coordination lack of alignment  program administration  technical infrastructure how can we efficiently process claims who arranges the providers in the program who monitors the performance to ensure the highest quality care is delivered which technology is really needed bundled program arrangements clinical quality assurance proprietary technology platform bundled program arrangements our team’s prior experience with bundled payment initiatives helped us identify the inefficiencies and barriers to creating valuebased care programs we have the administrative resources needed to launch a prospective bundled payment program minimizing disruptions to our partners that should be focused on caring for patients administrative resources include defined episodes of care episode pricing analytics network arrangement provider contracts risk reinsurance back to top clinical quality assurance our proprietary care model contessacaretm is the result of extensive clinical design that is centered upon a homebased recovery for what traditionally required a hospitalization the success of the home hospitalization and the entire episode is dependent upon our physiciandirected care coordination model patient identification strict eligibility requirements define which site is most suitable for the patient marketbased care coordinators contessa coordinators are located in your market and are an integral part of the care team realtime personalized inmarket intelligence is needed to effectively manage the network of ancillary providers detailed postop protocols contessa
