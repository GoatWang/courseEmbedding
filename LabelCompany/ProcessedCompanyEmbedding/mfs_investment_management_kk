class by our most senior investment professionals over the shorter term however your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks and

alternative investments such as derivatives hedge funds private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments before you invest in alternative investments you should consider your overall financial situation how much money you have to invest your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk  nonfinancial assets such as closelyheld businesses real estate oil gas and mineral

investment decision we make because limiting losses in volatile markets is just as critical as maximizing returns on the upside we have a riskaware culture in which every member of our investment team is responsible for assessing risk embedded in our investment process risk management is always on and we conduct rigorous reviews regularly at the portfolio security and firm levels in market downturns and during periods of market volatility our active skill helps us take on intentional rather than unintentional risk — and it helps us find good entry points to invest for longterm value

collaborative approach for mfs “all star” portfolios  morningstar disclosure the morningstar rating for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns which are not indicative of future results class a share star ratings do not include any frontend sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms eg plan participants of a

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
