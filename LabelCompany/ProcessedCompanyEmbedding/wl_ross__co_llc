page about about us privacy terms wilbur ross quotes american  businessman born november     loading there is no evidence that more regulation makes things better the most highly regulated industry in america is commercial banking and that didnt save those institutions from making terrible decisions wilbur ross decisions america better its important to have a sound idea but the really important thing is the implementation wilbur ross important sound idea my wife hillary sometimes accuses me of trying to reinvent the th century in some ways shes right because i like things that i can understand and that arent too complicated wilbur ross wife trying me the one term i dont like to be called is a vulture because to me a vulture is a kind of assetstripper that eats dead flesh off the bones of a dead creature our bird should be the phoenix the bird that reinvents itself recreates itself from its ashes and thats much closer to what it is that we really do wilbur ross bird me kind i think its natural for any manager to want to grow his business the question is at what rate and in what direction and in what format wilbur ross business direction want i dont think theres anything inherently wrong with a bank being big in fact there are some good arguments about universality of geography that in theory if you have all your eggs in one little community and some big employer goes out that could be your downfall wilbur ross good community think banking i would argue is the most heavily regulated industry in the world regulations dont solve things supervision solves things wilbur ross world banking most shipping has a great oversupply of vessels that came from overordering a few years back we think  may be when it turns around wilbur ross great think back you cannot just keep borrowing more and more and keep spending more and more without eventually having a day of reckoning wilbur ross day you more shale gas if left to flourish could create several hundred thousand more jobs wilbur ross create more left i think at the end of the day the real sick man of europe is liable to turn out to be france not greece not portugal not spain not italy the reason is france is very uncompetitive to begin with on a global scale and the measures that hollande has been putting in have been very very negative from the point of view of economic growth wilbur ross growth man day each weekend i play at least one and maybe two sets of tennis a day my doubles team was in the finals recently at my tennis club in palm beach and lost a tiebreaker after a threehour match i must confess by the end of the three hours i was relieved it was over wilbur ross beach team day ships are a strange kind of commodity because theyre very lumpy very big individual units but theyre commodities wilbur ross strange kind ships everybody talks about tariffs as the first thing tariffs are the last thing tariffs are part of the negotiation the real trick is going to be increase american exports get rid of some of the tariff and nontariff barriers to american exports wilbur ross american negotiation real the fact that youre successful doesnt mean that you cant relate to working people wilbur ross successful people working i see myself as a privateequity investor that helps rebuild companies restructuring is a cottage industry in that there arent that many serious practitioners wilbur ross myself see serious generally speaking companies get into bankruptcy as a kind of meritocracy somebody made some sort of big mistake to get into bankruptcy and very often a part of the mistake is too much leverage wilbur ross mistake kind leverage between the community redevelopment act requiring banks to make what i would call very weak loans and specific quotas that the congress imposed on fannie mae and freddie mac that created the market demand that really led to the subprime phenomenon wilbur ross community act weak the typical big japanese company has somewhere between a third and  percent of its revenues coming from developing countries and about a third of japans exports are also to the emerging countries so in a strange way japan which has very little internal growth its big companies are a good way to play the emerging markets wilbur ross good growth strange the fundamentals are the us is going to end up being a net exporter of natural gas thats going to be wonderful to help our balance of payments reduce our dependence on a lot of countries that arent so crazy about us and change many many parts of what goes on here wilbur ross change balance end if you want to do something to destroy consumer spending just eat away at the middle class because the other problem we have is the structural problem of middle class america wilbur ross america problem want mexico has  treaties with other countries that make it very advantageous to do international shipping from mexico rather than from the united states believe it or not mexico has better treaties with the rest of the world than the united states does wilbur ross world believe better the problem with regional trade agreements is you get picked apart by the first country then you negotiate with the second country you get picked apart and you go with the third one you get picked apart again wilbur ross problem you country many of the smaller banks have had to get to the point where they now have more compliance people than they have lending offices thats crazy wilbur ross crazy people more part of the reason why im supporting trump is that i think we need a more radical new approach to government  at least in the us  from what weve had before wilbur ross government why think if you add up all the promises any politician makes the math doesnt work hillary clintons math doesnt work donalds math probably doesnt work i think you have to listen to their campaign pitches more as symbolic more as metaphors wilbur ross work promises think share this page cite this
