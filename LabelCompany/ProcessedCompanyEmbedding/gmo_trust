need to know about gmos by kate siegel suzanne verity genetically modified organisms  plants and animals whose genes have been changed by scientists  arent just thought over theyre fought over gmos often make news related to the environment world hunger the economy politics and yes even health those against them say eating foods made from gmos is bad for you those in favor argue that youre way better off from the benefits that gmos and other sciencebased innovations bring to the farm the store and the table a  survey by the pew research center shows this divide nearly  out of  scientists from the american association for the advancement of science say gmos are generally safe to eat though if youre like more than half of us adults from the general public in that same survey you think you probably shouldnt eat them people disagree about when you should call something genetically modified they argue about whether or not food made with gmos should be labeled they debate the longterm effects that producing and eating them will have on our planet and our bodies so what do you need to know to make good choices for your health nature on fastforward lets start with the basics changes to genes arent necessarily a bad thing they happen in nature in fact no matter whats on the menu it isnt exactly the same as what grew hundreds or thousands of years ago bits of dna called genes are responsible for all sorts of characteristics and traits in every living thing from height to how certain cells work useful traits help the plants and animals with them survive or thrive better than ones without them so they get passed along and eventually become common our ancestors sped up the process when they saved seeds of creamofthecrop plants to grow the next time and the next and the next thats what turned small bunches of tiny kernels on tall grass  years ago into the big ears of juicy corn on the cob we have today with animals picks of the litter were paired to breed newandimproved babies continued faster still  bypassing many many generations and seasons  are the ways that scientists create todays genetic changes or modifications they alter the dna of seeds with radiation or chemicals then choose which resulting plants to breed or they can snip a gene or several from a plant virus or bacteria and plug it in to another to transfer a desired feature these more precise and targeted adjustments often referred to as genetic engineering create what people typically think of when they hear gmos sometimes scientists move genes that come from the same kind of thing like from one tomato plant to another but they can mix different species too like a virus and a tomato plant why bother mixing plant species is how weve gotten papayas free of viruses corn plants that survive drought soybeans that stand up to weed killer potatoes that dont bruise and crops that yield more and cost less thats good news for our food supply and the business of farming some gmos are specially made to be packed with extra vitamins minerals and other health benefits for example swiss researchers created a strain of golden rice with a lot of betacarotene an antioxidant good for your eyes and skin soybeans whose fats have been changed so theyre more like olive oil can be turned into a hearthealthy replacement for oils with trans fats thats more heattolerant and better for cooking and those bruisefree potatoes are supposed to cut down on cancercausing chemicals created when spuds become french fries some biotech companies are doing experiments to make meat better for us such as boosting the amount of omegafatty acids in it these essential fats help prevent heart disease and stroke and may protect against cancer and other conditions they may also help control lupus eczema and rheumatoid arthritis but your body doesnt make them so you have to get them from food as the population grows its going to get harder to feed everyone the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao estimates food production will need to double in some parts of the world by  gmos are one way to make enough nutritious food available with limited land water and other resources but people worry about pollen and seeds from genetically engineered plants spreading beyond the fields where they were planted or what could happen if genetically modified animals mate with nonmodified or wild ones continued are they safe many critics think of the dna in gmobased foods as if its toxic a bad thing says alison van eenennaam phd cooperative extension specialist in animal genomics and biotechnology at the university of california davis as unappetizing as it may sound dna has always been part of our diet and its digested in your stomach along with the rest of your food she says there is not some evil trace of poison we got ruby red grapefruits through natural mutation yet few are questioning the safety of all the random genetic changes that went into their development says kevin klatt a phd student in the molecular nutrition program at cornell university what seems to make people uncomfortable is when those changes happen deliberately in a lab a group of scientists did an extensive review of research on the safety of crops from gmos over the past  years they found no significant harm directly tied to genetic engineering and the american medical association thinks genetically modified foods are ok part of an official statement notes that in almost  years no clear impacts on human health have been reported or confirmed in professional journals the world health organization agrees they along with the fao maintain a set of sciencebased standards guidelines and practices called the codex alimentarius to promote good safe food for everyone it includes biotechnology and genetic engineering too many governments draw from the codex to write their regulations and recommendations but there are still big differences of opinion even among some scientists and doctors stephen macdonald phd a biotechnology and business strategy consultant agrees that all foods  at the most basic level  are made of the same stuff even so he doesnt dish up gmobased foods for dinner because hes not convinced they have the same exact nutritional value i dont think they are dangerous per se but i dont trust the data that says they are entirely safe either he says but klatt says there is no evidence that exposing foods to chemicals or radiation is safer than methods of genetic engineering over the last  years these approaches to causing genetic changes in seeds has given us around  altered crops why isnt there as much fuss over them the public might be less familiar with traditional breeding techniques and therefore less concerned he says continued the role of the fda the fdas job is to make sure all food  genetically altered or not  is safe to eat through the plant biotechnology consultation program the fda raises safety concerns during the engineering process and helps developers identify the kinds of testing they should do a team of fda scientists reviews information provided by the developer they look at how a genetically engineered food compares to the original is it different nutritionally did the new genes introduce something that could be harmful for example a soybean enriched with a protein from a brazil nut wasnt brought to market even as animal feed because tests showed that it might trigger a reaction for people with an allergy to those nuts you cant catch a disease or get a virus from a plant but every now and then one makes its way from animals to humans like swine flu and bird flu because animal viruses may be used in genetic engineering some people worry they could infect humans or other animals that eat meat produced this way thats why the fda takes a slightly different approach with genetically engineered animal products theyve issued guidance to help developers meet the high standards of the codex alimentarius and us food safety regulations the center for veterinary medicine makes sure the animal is different in the way the developer says it is and that its safe to eat the fda is also required by the national environmental policy act to consider potential significant impacts of gmo animals on the environment like how easily they could spread disease for a genetically engineered salmon that grows to full size in about half the time it normally takes the fda wanted to know how likely these fish would be to mix with ones whose genes havent been tinkered with and how likely they would be to survive and reproduce if they did to minimize the risks the developer raises the salmon in secure facilities in canada and panama the tanks arent connected to any body of water and they have barriers such as screens and nets to prevent fish and eggs from getting out as well as birds and other predators from getting in the salmon grown for food are sterile a gmo food isnt allowed in stores in the us until the fda team is satisfied its safe ultimately the developer is legally responsible for the foods safety like any other product we eat continued can gmos change your dna even though its never happened before some people fear that you could become genetically modified from eating gmo food but genetic material doesnt get tacked on like pin the tail on the donkey an added gene isnt going to fall off and get stuck to yours bacteriafighting enzymes and processes in your body are designed to prevent a genetic invasion as a report from the american medical associations council on science and public health explains if an outside germ somehow survived digestion and got into your gut bacteria it would have to be enough like your own dna in just the right place at just the right time to glom onto one of your genes and change it to put things in perspective its just as possible or impossible for nongmo foods to change your genes anything you eat has dna thats foreign to you even so scientists take great care not to use genes that have any hint that they might cause problems whats in your food even though you may not realize it you probably eat gmos now up to  of processed foods in the us have them most of the sugar we eat comes from beets and almost all of them are gmos these days changing their genes has brought about bigger better sugar beets that are stronger and last longer than those grown in the past and whatever the source its just sugar or sucrose no dna no protein van eenennaam says there isnt something different or extra in sugar that comes from a bioengineered sugar beet nothing in the sugar can tell you where it came from you cant avoid eating genetically engineered sugar because it doesnt exist she explains engineered corn is the source of a lot of cornstarch used to thicken soups and sauces as well as the corn syrup that sweetens foods and drinks cottonseed canola and soybean oils made from gmos go into mayo salad dressing cereal bread and snacks galore but way more gmos  as much as  of whats grown  are used as animal feed studies show there is no difference in the makeup of meat milk eggs or other food that comes from animals whove been fed them and the animals themselves are just as healthy as those that eat nongmo meals the fda looks out for them by testing the safety of animal feed too continued can you avoid them china australia and the european union require gmo foods to be labeled but the us doesnt many states are in the process of passing laws about the labeling and sale of genetically engineered food but some federal lawmakers are trying to overrule them and prevent that the fda favors voluntary labeling and has published recommendations for manufacturers the agency also takes public comments about this guidance and is considering some citizen petitions the question of what could need a label is another sticky subject foods created by changing genes with radiation or chemicals dont fall under gmo regulations and wouldnt have to be labeled the latest methods of genetic engineering arent covered by older rules so you wont see labels on those foods either but the national academy of sciences says this inconsistency doesnt make sense what matters is the fact that genes have been artificially changed not the way it was done if you want to stay away from gmos eat only fresh whole unprocessed foods marked certified organic or usda organic thats how macdonald shops but the makers of these foods tag them on the honor system and theyre not checked by the government and its ok for these claims to appear on foods developed from genes originally altered by chemicals or radiation claims of nongmo and gmo free cant be scientifically or legally supported by any testing methods but the nonprofit nongmo project has independently certified specific foods and products from more than  brands as made with best practices for avoiding gmos look for the nongmo project verified seal in the produce section only a few things might be gmos edamame papayas from hawaii summer squash sweet corn zucchini the fastergrowing salmon which the fda cleared in november  after several years of study will probably be the first animal gmo in the supermarket after guidelines are set for how to label it even if that happened today it would be months or years before you could buy any stores like earth fare the fresh market sprouts farmers market and whole foods want to make sure their customers know what theyre buying and have choices these grocers offer their own nongmo products as well as stocking other brands without gmos when youre dining out your best bet is a restaurant that uses organic ingredients continued the great plate debate the overwhelming science so far says that gmos wont hurt us but concerns like the chance  however unlikely  that gmos may cause genetic changes allergies or other serious harm to your health leave room for further study there could be consequences no one thought to look for or traits scientists cant test for yet or worstcase scenarios reviewers hadnt considered for his peace of mind macdonald would like to see more careful welldesigned studies done in

modified organisms in many packaged foods—including those labeled natural published october  more than  percent of americans say they don’t want genetically modified organisms in their food according to a recent consumer reports national research center survey of  adults the trouble is it’s hard to avoid them consumer reports’ tests of breakfast cereals chips soy infant formulas and other popular products found that gmos lurk in many packaged foods—including some that carry labels suggesting that they don’t have these controversial ingredients in more than  countries manufacturers must label foods that contain genetically modified ingredients but gmo labeling isn’t required in the us yet our survey found that  percent of americans want genetically modified foods to be labeled and concerns about the potential health and environmental risks of gmos coupled with an unwillingness on the part of the federal government to mandate labeling are leading many states to take action on their own vermont recently passed legislation requiring gmo labeling and similar actions are being considered in more than two dozen other states including colorado and oregon where residents will begin voting on a gmolabeling ballot initiative in late october “federal law already requires labeling that lets consumers know whether foods have been previously frozen made from concentrate pasteurized or irradiated and we believe the label should also say if food is genetically engineered” says jean halloran director of food policy initiatives at consumers union the policy arm of consumer reports what are gmos anyway genetically modified organisms are created by deliberately changing the genetic makeup of a plant or animal in ways that could never occur in nature the majority of gmo crops currently on the market have been genetically engineered to produce their own pesticides andor withstand herbicides that normally would kill them  farmers use the herbicides to control weeds safety concerns you may be surprised to know that the federal government has not mandated that genetically modified organisms be proved safe before theyre used in your food but safety assessments are mandatory in other major developed countries including china japan and the countries of the european union some animal studies suggest that gmos may cause damage to the immune system liver and kidneys “there hasn’t been enough research to determine whether gmos are harmful to people” says michael hansen phd senior scientist at consumers union and an authority on genetic engineering “but scientists around the world agree that gmos have the potential to introduce allergens and create other unintended changes that may affect health” the use of genetically modified seeds has steadily grown over the last two decades that has led to about a fold increase in farmers’ use of glyphosate a weedkiller better known as roundup which is made by monsanto—a company that also produces genetically modified seeds—because the herbicide won’t harm their gmo crops but that in turn has created a new problem for farmers to battle a rising number of “superweeds” that have now become immune to glyphosate “this defeats one of the major reasons why gmos were introduced in the first place” hansen says   the food industry’s take companies that produce genetically modified organisms and their allies in the food industry argue that genetic engineering is just an extension of traditional breeding which humans have been doing for thousands of years but that process involves the transfer of dna between closely related plants or animals genetic engineering techniques on the other hand move genetic material from any organism to any other organism   there is fierce opposition to gmo labeling from many seed manufacturers and big food companies which have spent nearly  million in california and washington state alone to defeat gmolabeling ballot initiatives one of the major arguments they make is that stamping foods with a statement such as “contains gmo ingredients” implies that those foods are inferior to other conventional or organic foods when there’s no evidence that genetically modified organisms are harmful “our position is that gmo foods should be labeled period halloran says consumers have the right to know what’s in their food so that they can make informed choices learn what you can do to support mandatory gmo labeling gmos are found in surprising places gmo labeling should be required in the us but in the meantime some food manufacturers are choosing not to use genetically modified ingredients and are noting that on their products packaging to see how many foods have gmos and whether you can trust the claims you see on food packages we bought more than  different processed foods containing corn or soy between april and july  corn and soy are the two most widely grown genetically engineered crops in the us we tested at least two samples of each product each sample from a different lot to measure the gmo content then we compared our results with any nongmorelated claims find a list of all the products we tested in our full report genetically modified corn and soy are used in a wide variety of foods nearly all of the samples we tested of the products that did not make any nongmorelated claim on the package did in fact contain substantial amounts of genetically modified corn or soy they included many familiar foods such as kellogg’s froot loops general mills corn chex jiffy corn muffin mix doritos oven baked nacho cheese chips and boca original vegan veggie burgers four of the products in this group were soybased infant formulas enfamil prosobee soy infant formula gerber good start soy similac soy isomil and similac go  grow soy infant formula because our tests represented only a small slice of the market we can’t draw conclusions about all products containing corn or soy or about every product for a given brand  but until genetically modified organism labeling becomes mandatory our test results can help you decode the meaning behind the claims you see on grocery store shelves photo courtesy organic claims this indicates that a third party has certified that the product complies with usda organic guidelines which forbid the use of genetically modified organisms our tests found that products with organic ingredients—such as amy’s all american veggie burgers  everyday value organic corn tortillas and soy dream vanilla frozen dessert—qualified as nongmo many of the products that make organic claims also make some kind of nongmo claim on their packaging photo courtesy nongmo project verified seal all of the products we tested with this seal qualified as nongmo that means the product had no more than  percent genetically modified organisms in eu countries products that have ingredients that contain more than  percent genetically modified organisms are required by law to carry gmo labeling the nongmo project certifies manufacturers products through thirdparty testing among the products we tested that carried this seal were post grape nuts original cereal and silk original soymilk uncertified nongmo claims these claims made by the manufacturer—which may include the words no gmo and nongmo—have no standard definition and don’t require independent verification even so most of the products we tested containing nonorganic corn or soy that made an uncertified claim met nongmo standards these included clif builder’s chocolate peanut butter bar and bob’s red mill golden corn flour the exception was xochitl totopos de maiz original corn chips the package read “no gmo” and “all natural”  but our tests showed that the amount of genetically modified corn in the six samples we tested averaged more than  percent the manufacturer said it uses corn from a supplier that provided test results with many of the deliveries xochitl received indicating that the corn was nongmo when we tested samples from two packages of xochitl totopos de maiz organic white corn chips which were also labeled no gmo we found that the product met nongmo standards natural claims more than  percent of people in our national survey said they believed that “natural” means “no gmos” but that’s not what our tests found virtually all of the samples we tested of products that made only a natural claim did have a substantial amount of gmos although since we did our testing some manufacturers have removed the natural claim or have become nongmo project verified “the confusing nature of this claim is just one reason we are asking the government to ban the use of natural labels on food” says urvashi rangan phd director of the safety and sustainability center at consumer reports   —andrea rock take action if you’re in favor of genetically modified organism labeling efforts and you live in oregon or colorado your vote this fall obviously can communicate that message those who live elsewhere can contact their state legislators to express their support for mandatory labeling this is especially important if you live in one of the more than  states that have legislation pending on this issueyou also can contact your congressional representatives in washington dc to urge them to support the genetically engineered food right to know act a federal bill calling for mandatory labeling that has been introduced by sen barbara boxer dcalifornia and rep peter defazio doregon  ‪and for more information on gmo food and updates on labeling go to notinmyfoodorg     email newsletters free email newsletterschoose from

no epidemiological study relating consumption to healthalthough the industry aggressively tries to discredit all studies showing potential harm there are many showing toxicity in animals that predict serious medical consequences in humans from longterm exposure finally contrary to industry claims genetically modified crops have produced no increase in yield have elevated the use of herbicides

manufacturers’ relevance consumer trust  commentsby elizabeth crawfordelizabeth crawford  febtzlast updated on feb at  gmttz source the hartman group related tags gmo genetically modified hartman group nongmo project verified organic as more consumers avoid genetically modified organisms manufacturers that fail to label whether their products contain gmos are at an increased risk of losing consumer trust and relevance according to the hartman group  a consumer survey conducted by the market research firm recently revealed that four out of  consumers claim to be avoiding or reducing genetically modified foods in their daily diet and  of consumers are buying more nongmo products than last yearthe main reason for avoiding gmos given by  of consumers is they are concerned about the possible impact of gmos on their health and wellbeing followed by  of consumers who said they avoid gmos because they “want to know exactly what goes into the food i eat” according to the hartman organic  natural  report  “but when probed very few consumers can identify any singular specific health issue or disease risk to gmo consumption through their diet” which suggests “their stated health concern is really a concern about transparency” according to the report“fear of the unknown is driving most of the attitudinal concerns among consumers” the report adds noting that as a result  of consumers support mandatory gmo labeling and nearly half support banning the ingredientsmany manufacturers are responding by labeling when products do not include gmo with more than  bearing the nongmo project verified seal according to caroline kinsman communications manager for the nongmo project she notes that since the first nongmo project product was verified in  “we have been experiencing exponential growth” and “are verifying approximately  products each month”consumers are drawn to products with the seal because it offers them transparency into what they are eating and provides assurance that they are consuming “the most trusted alternatives to gmo food and products available today” kinsman saidmanufacturers that fail to label their products one way or the other risk losing consumer trust and could face liability issues in the near future according to the hartman group“the increasing availability of nongmo and labeled products further erodes consumer trust in companies who remain silent” the group notes adding that “taking a proactive approach to labeling gmos is likely to be perceived as positive in terms of transparency and care for the consumer”consumer perception of sealsbut simply qualifying for the nongmo project verified seal is not a panacea for food manufacturers facing the threat of lost sales due to gmo concerns the hartman group’s research revealsit found a  of gmo adverse consumers are not aware of the nongmo seal followed by  who have seen the seal but do not know what it means and  who are familiar with it but do not consider it when making food and beverage choices currently only  of gmo adverse consumers and  of core organic consumers actively look for the seal when making food and beverage choices according to the hartman group’s reportmany gmo adverse consumers also do not trust the usda organic seal to identify nongmo products the report reveals“although very trusting of the usda organic seal when shopping for organic foodsbeverages” only  of gmo adverse consumers would use the seal to identify nongmo products according to the reportthis may be due to so few consumers knowing that products must be nongmo to qualify as certified organic the report found only  of gmo adverse consumers and  of core organic consumers correctly stated without a prompt that usda certified organic products did not contain gmo ingredients“long term nongmo’s overlap with organic is likely to become more widely known in the coming years reducing its uniqueness” but until then manufacturers of organic foods might consider the redundant certification according to the hartman group it adds that current consumer behavior suggests the nongmo project verified seal will most likely “create the strongest correlation to purchase in nonorganic but otherwise natural fresh dairy meat and select center store categories more education necessaryconsumer education about gmos beyond using seals also is important for food manufacturers because gmo is “a nebulous concept” that many consumers do not understand which is generating mistrust of the food industry as a whole the hartman group saidit explains that while most consumers have heard of gmos confusion lingers about what they are what foods they are in and the pros and cons of themonly  of consumers say they know what gmos are only  know which crops are most likely to be gmo and only  know which products have gmo ingredientsthis lack of understanding is generating concerns that damage the overall food industry’s reputation the report’s findings suggestfor example some consumers view gmos as “unnatural and manipulated in a laboratory for questionable purposes” and others believe companies using gmo ingredients “are putting profit over consumers’ health” according to the report in addition “indignation over producers of gmos treating small farmers poorly and using coercive and unfair business tactics” reflects poorly on the food industry the hartman group notesthe easiest solution might be labeling gmos it adds given that “continued silence of food companies on the issue as well as some companies’ attempts to fight labeling only fuels consumer distrust and fears that companies are hiding something” this content is copyright protected however if you would like to share the information in this article you may use the headline summary and link

free buying  organic certified organic and usda organiclabeled products is usually the easiest way to identify and avoid genetically modified ingredients the united states and canadian governments do not allow companies to label products “  certified organic” if they contain genetically modified foods to put it in more detail  organic must contain  percent organically produced ingredients excluding water and salt this is the only label that certifies a completely organic product and completely gmofree ingredients certified organic  usda organic at least  percent of content is organic by weight excluding water and salt the  remaining ingredients must consist of substances approved on the usda’s national list gmos are not on this list so usda organic products are also usually gmofree for verification consult the following sources the usda’s national organic program overview page the usda’s national list of allowed and prohibited substances the usda’s organic  blog a  usda policy memo in response to confusion over gmos in organics the national organic standards board policy and procedures manual made with organic up to  of the ingredients are organic these products can not carry a “usda organic” label however their “remaining nonorganic ingredients are produced without prohibited practices including genetic engineering” but lately even organic products are at risk… why say “usually” if usda certification requires at least  of content to be organic and a gmo ingredient can’t be included in that  then usda organic is gmofree right not always depending on the product sometimes there are tiny loopholes says barry estabrook author of politics of the plate in this excellent article “the casings for those tasty usda organic sausages can come from conventionally raised animals that have been fed antibiotics or gmoladen corn the hops in your favorite organic beer can be sprayed with all manner of chemical pesticides and fertilizers” the usda’s loophole list also includes two far more common ingredients nonorganic cornstarch which in our opinion is long overdue for removal from the “acceptable” list considering how many sources of organic cornstarch are now readily available to commercial food manufacturers and soy lecithin though only one form of soy lecithin is allowed and only when an organic option is not available the loophole list includes a few surprises too such as the use of antibiotics on organic apples and pears in order to prevent fire blight fortunately the national organics standards board recently decided to disallow this practice effective october  how are these organic loopholes possible typically it’s because there is no readily available commercially manufactured organic option for that particular product or ingredient though in the case of organic cornstarch we beg to differ if you’re curious to know more here’s a great article that describes how these decisions get made but sometimes there’s another reason… says barry “the national organic standards board nosb which has the power to determine what materials can — and cannot — be used in organic production too often weakens regulations in the face of intense lobbying by corporations who are more interested in the higher profits conferred by the word “organic” than in strong and meaningful standards” and let’s just remember how much monsanto has invested in corporate lobbying dollars… getting discouraged yet there’s more… despite rigid organic certification procedures organic certification is about the process of growing food not about the actual resulting food there is no testing process for organic ingredients so there is a chance that gmo contamination could occur and sadly gmo contamination can happen any number of natural ways  via crosspollination between gmo and nongmo crops  from trace amounts of gmo ingredients found in animal feed as per the alfalfabluegrass section above  from seeds traveling by wind or by migratory birds that take root in the soil of an organic farm and  from ingredient suppliers that comingle various sources just look at this recent response from the usda regarding a series of questions raised by organic farmers after gmo alfalfa was approved a similar situation is already happening in australia— a farmer just lost his organic certification due to windborne contamination from a neighboring gmo crop even more sobering is the potential contamination from genetically engineered kentucky bluegrass this grass is used in animal forage — including grassfed animals now that kentucky bluegrass been genetically engineered for roundup resistance not only does it contain genetic material that is no longer natural but it can be heavily sprayed with roundup to remove weeds and because grass spreads rapidly it’s only a matter of time before this becomes the next superweed last but not least “contamination” can also happen when it takes nearly three years for a manufacturer who illegally uses the term “organic” in their labeling to be noticed reported investigated and forced to amend their label the oversight of organic manufacturers “falls far short of assuring standards are met” buying usda organic  gmo free as explained above buying usda organic is by no means a failsafe however at this point in time usda organic remains one of the best and most easilyidentifiable ways of assuring that you are eating gmofree foods most of the time want to take it one step further buy products that are also certified by the nongmo project the certification process behind this label is currently the best possible way of assuring that you are eating gmofree food though bear in mind not all of the products bearing the nongmo project label are organic—for the best of both worlds chose products that also include the usda organic label sadly however just like organic certification the word “usually” once again comes into play the nongmo project’s website clearly states that its label does not guarantee a product is  gmofree because contamination is an evergrowing threat so what does the label really mean gmo free certification process when you see the above label on a product it means the producer took additional time effort and money to go through a certification program similar to the one used to obtain organic certification only it’s designed to focus on gmofree processes started initially by retailers the nongmo project’s product verification program pvp‘s core requirements include “traceability segregation and testing at critical control points” compliant products bear the nongmo project seal shown above explained in detail here indicating that the product has been produced in accordance with the best practices of the nongmo project standard read a great article about the reasons why this program was started despite similar process testing procedures for organic products another gmo free certification process those of you who are familiar with natural food certifiers‘ “apple k kosher” certification process  label will be happy to know that the organization now offers their own nongmo verification program and label called gmo guard announced in  nfc’s program “meets the nogmo verification needs for the entire food chain from farm to table is designed to be as clear and easy to navigate as possible and remain affordable” other gmo free labels when you see a “gmo free” label on an organic product how does it compare to certified organic or certified nongmo project standards hard to say because there is no certification program associated with this label it is simply the producer’s word that all fields ingredients processes and storage avoid contact with and contain no genetically modified ingredients this doesn’t mean this label isn’t valid sometimes producers can’t afford the cost of becoming certified organic or certified through the nongmo project and thus use this label as a sign of good faith and because so many consumers don’t know that certified organic  gmo free i didn’t until i did the research it can be a more obvious and affordable way of letting customers know no label in sight sometimes you need to read the fine print some manufacturers don’t include a little gmo free icon but they do include the words “we don’t use genetically engineered ingredients” or similar wording on the back of their labeling hope you brought your reading glasses to the grocery store 🙂 organic versus certified naturally grown when the usda organic program started in  many small farms were forced to make a difficult choice either pay high certification fees and complete mounds of paperwork to become “certified organic” or give up using the word “organic” to describe their produce andor livestock believing that neither choice was very attractive a group of farmers created certified naturally grown cng to provide an alternative way to assure their customers that they observed strict growing practices their methods include using natural biological cycles – incorporating a careful balance of microorganisms soil flora and fauna natural pollinators plants and animals – to create a sustainable farming system the resulting products meet and in some cases exceed the usda standards but do not carry any of the official government approved organic seals cng now consists of more than  member farms in  states and growing note the majority of the cng producers farms and apiaries that i perused included the words “gmo free” in their product descriptions other “natural” product labeling terms additional labeling terms – such as natural cage free free range certified humane raised and handled vegetarian diet fair trade and locally grown – have no direct relevance to whether a product is gmo free genetically modified vegetables can and do get used in animal feed sometimes… particularly corn fed to pigs cows and chickens for a helpful description about each of these click here for a helpful ranking chart about egg labeling in particular click here the even longer story behind gmos and organics includes excerpts from the organic and non gmo report website to have a product certified as organic a producermanufacturerfarmer must undergo third party verification to ensure that the requirements of usda national organic program are met these requirements certify the process of growing the crop they do not test the resulting cropsfood processes that are reviewed include • all production methods — which must be free from most synthetic chemicals eg pesticides herbicides  fertilizers antibiotics  hormones genetically modified organisms irradiation and use of biosolids • all farmlands — which must be free from synthetic chemicals for generally  or more years • storage procedures — producers must keep strict physical separation of organic products and noncertified products • onsite inspections — producers are subject to initial and sometimes subsequent inspections want to read an even more detailed description about organic certification click here organic certifiers want to ensure that gmos are not used in organic products but getting  percent verification that all substances are nongmo may not be possible apparently the effort is significant and requiring  percent verification could grind a processor’s operation to a halt due to a lack of guidance from us national organic program nop organic certifiers have developed their own methods to address gmo challenges posed by nonorganic ingredients for that  of nonorganic ingredients allowed in foods labeled organic oregon tilth certified organic and ccof developed flowcharts or “decision trees” to evaluate the gm status of ingredients quality assurance international qai developed a gmo declaration that it asks clients to submit to verify the nongmo status of ingredients says gwendolyn wyard oregon tilth’s processing program reviewer “the problem is that “organic” is a process certification we’re asking whether they use gmos not whether there is gm dna or protein in the final product” verifying the nongm status of some ingredients can be challenging for example the supply of the ingredient tocopherolvitamin e has been controlled by one or two companies who collected soybean oil from many comingled sources oregon tilth requires that tocopherols come from an identity preserved nongm source but quality assurance international qai does not require an ip identity preserved tocopherol says jessica walden qai technical specialist instead qai developed a “gmo declaration” to address questions raised by the nop’s rule on genetic engineering the declaration describes qai’s policy toward gmos focusing on three categories when a product is a nonorganic agricultural ingredient such as cornstarch in order to qualify as nongmo in “organic” and “made with organic” categories the original organism that produced the ingredient must be nongenetically modified when a product is a nonorganic nonagricultural ingredient such as flavors and colors the product must be free from genetically modified dna or proteins lastly if microorganisms such as citric acid are used the microorganism must be a nongmo on the declaration the supplier must highlight measures taken to verify their nongmo claim such as traceabilityidentity preservation gmo testing and independent audits qai’s gmo declaration has streamlined the response from suppliers for gmo documentation instead of receiving various gmo statements qai has its clients submit the gmo declaration reading all of this you gain a new respect for farmers who not only buck the industrial farming system by going organic but by their perseverance in navigating the volumes and diverse methods of certification so what does this all boil down to when you’re trying to choose a product just this week i was looking for mayonnaise at my local natural foods coop they had a fairly broad selection of various organic mayonnaises from different manufacturers all of the mayo labels said “organic” somewhere on the label two of them said usda certified organic but only one had “gmo free” in addition to “organic” on the label coincidentally it was the only mayonnaise that was not made from one the “big four” gmo crops corn soy canola or cotton seed oil does that mean it was the only mayo that was gmo free no the others were labeled organic which technically means they couldn’t be gmo yet they didn’t have a “nongmo” label and they were sourced from crops with high incidences of gmo farming soy and canola i tried consulting my two “non gmo shopping list” iphone apps but none of the mayo brands on the shelf were mentioned either as a pro or a con so i ended up playing it extra safe and buying the safflowerbased mayo with the nongmo label what would you have done learn more… to view or download if you wish a pdf document containing an indepth evidencebased examination of the “myths and truths”

reply ↓ unfortunately they do not consider the poison fluoride a contaminant so they can use it in the process when it comes to the usda certification the government just put a man in charge of their organic certification that was an executive for monsanto and under the usda guidelines beef can be fed and injected with anything up till the last  to  weeks before slaughter when they must be fed only organic feed but the damage has already been done the best way to be sure of what you get is to go to a local farm if possible and grow your own gardens these can be grown in cities as well as in the country just use raised beds and get rid of the lawn reply ↓ pingback why we need gmo labeling and how to get it « gmo awareness i’ve done some research on this certified organic does not mean it is nongmo according to what i found out nor is there any such thing as government certification for nongmo there are private certifications but they are not regulated by the government which can then mean you have to simply trust them like i trust the government the problem with nongmo is there is no national standard and it can be very misleading to consumers to claim “nongmo” in a product reply ↓ jouh i did extensive research myself and while it’s true that there is no way to guarantee a product is truly gmofree due in part to crosscontamination testing of practice versus product and companies who are quite simply not telling the truth certified organic does indeed have established parameters to prevent gmos in the product if you check my links you will see i have sourced actual documents wherever possible now i will agree that many of us have lost faith in both the government and private certifications but underneath that is a lack of faith in any human effort and i am more of a “glass half full” person who wants to believe that somewhere somehow the truth will prevail 😀 reply ↓ thank you for this information it is so sad that we live in a world where food is becoming less of a solution and more of a problem greed is the standard and those with less will suffer so much more safe healthy nonmodified hazard free food should really be the goal of all providers governments and even big business money should not mean more than human life reply ↓ you are most welcome tameca it is sad… but i take comfort that we live in a country where we have choices i couldn’t agree with you more… reply ↓ are we really sure that we have choices just because we are on the subject does to you sounds like we have a choice when our govenrment imposes us to drink water added with fluoride have anyone even asked why we are coerced to drink water with fluoride i made a research and turns out that constant assumption of fluoride is unhelthy in particular for the adverse effects having on the human epithelial gland the most important gland in our body this is an extract of what i discovered “…fluorosis a progressive degenerative disorder resulted from excessive intake of fluoride f either by natural or by anthropogenic sources and most commonly through drinkingwater endemic fluorosis is prevalent in many parts of the world and often seriously impairs the health of human or animals fluorosis causes damage not only to skeletal tissue and teeth but also to soft tissues such as brain  several studies indicated that excessive exposure to fluoride may be associated with central nervous system dysfunction animal studies have shown that chronic or subchronic fluoride exposure may lead to changes in behavior and neurodegeneration – intelligence quotient iq in children with exposure to high fluoride levels in drinking water was reduced – although the toxic effects of fluoride on the central nervous system were found the specific mechanisms remained unknown…” my question is why should authorities add fluoride to our waters but not for example vitamines or other substances seen the effects of fluoride such as reducing human iq and seen the autority decision to impose us consumption of such substance couldn’t the answer be that fluoride is a very easy way for the government allies of the powerful rich to keep people mentally and so socially quite and obbidient so that the reacher can become reacher and powerful without having to deal with people that would be otherwise incomodous if belligerant this is a theory that i heard from other as well and makes perfectly sense to me maybe because my iq level is still in good condition due to the fact that i lived most of my life in europe where fluoride is not imposed by governments in water something to carefully think about it spittin real shit my nigga keep fightin’ the good fight that’s the truth reply ↓ i use a relatively affordable over the counter water filtration system that removes fluoride from my drinking water among other harmful elements it filters it’s ten stage water filtration enviro products by new wave for which you can buy refill

hopefully that much info won’t feel more overwhelming 🙂 httpsgmoawarenesscomshoppinglist reply ↓ so nice to find explanations that are thorough whew like we don’t have enough other things to do – being a little confused just makes it hangbanginghard lol i am still learning and wanted to ask the question – if it is labeled with a statement “nongmo nonsoy” doesn’t that equate with organic or no i am trying to raise an organically kept flock of hens and so far the local organically inclined gardening shop i purchase feed from has this new layer feed with that on the label looking ti up online the label explains that it uses peanuts and sorghum – which they also claim is nongmo at this time thoughts 🙂 reply ↓ hello tracy thanks for such an awesome compliment here’s my opinion about things that are labeled “nongmo” or any “nonwhatever” statement first i’m assuming there is no nongmo project certification label on the feed bag as that would answer the question for me immediately second if there’s no certification brand on the bag remember usda organic  nongmo too i personally like to see more proof behind mere words on a label does the chicken feed bag have a website printed on it does the website have an faq page that mentions gmos along with the company’s approach behind testingcertification if not is there an email or phone number you can contact to ask though sometimes the “customer service” people simply read the written stuff they’ve been given which often mirrors what’s printed on a label third i know of no genetically modified peanuts but i have heard of genetically modified sorghum and concerns about it crosspollinating with nongmo sorghum httpwwwwiredcomwiredsciencegmaluminumtol this does not mean they are using gmo sorghum it just means it exists last but not least have you heard of a company called “scratch and peck an eggsellent feed company they are nongmo project certified and they claim to be the only feed that is httpswwwfacebookcomscratchandpeckfrefts my summary opinion certified organic andor certified nongmo project products are superior not only for their lack of genetically engineered ingredients but also for their methods involving less pesticides antibiotics better animal welfare routine inspections and the like whew sorry for the long reply 🙂 and kudos to you for taking the extra time and effort to be aware and be healthy reply ↓ just starting this process and am very grateful to for your research and sharing of all this educational material reply ↓ barb you are most welcome reply ↓ thanks so much for this comprehensive post on the gmo debate with all the “greenwashing” out there it’s hard to know what’s a legitimate regulated label it’s so great seeing a community of people that care about this very important issue keep up the great work 🙂 reply ↓ thanks for finding me and helping to raise awareness… your blog looks awesome reply ↓ hi there someone in my facebook group shared this website with us so i came to take a look i’m definitely loving the information i’m bookmarking and will be tweeting this to my followers outstanding blog and superb design and style reply ↓ thanks so much crystle… i’ve been trying to figure out which facebook group or page shared my blog so i could give them a big round of thanks if you don’t feel comfy sharing please pass along my gratitude the more we can all raise awareness the better our future reply ↓ i have heard many people wonder why should they spend more  on gmofree products when they cannot trust whether their food is gmo free or not the answer is simple if you buy products that are labeled “organic” then you have a  chance that you are buying gmo free and pesticide free food if you decide to purchase nonorganic food then what is your chance of getting gmo free food practically zero  the choice is yours but i’d rather take my chances on the  than the zero how about you reply ↓ i’ve used the same argument… agreed  another thing i like to tell people is… where our dollars go so follows the market do you want to support mega corporations who use your dollars to fight gmo labeling measures like so many of them did with california’s prop  or do you wanna support familyowned companies with ethics who provide us with organic gmofree food and go out of their way to help raise awareness about gmos i know what my answer is… 🙂 thanks for commenting reply ↓ great point reply ↓ reblogged this on cultivateeatsustain reply ↓ the problem i’ve found with a company saying they use gmo free ingredients or a store claiming there is no gmo produce in their stores is that they don’t know because gmo’s are not labeled i met a lady who makes a homemade product and puts a sticker on it that says it’s gmofree when i looked at the ingredients and asked her about the coconut she uses she said it’s just the baker’s angel flake sweetened coconut from the store i called baker’s  they said their sugar has gmo sugar beet sugar so this lady was wrong in putting her sticker on her product even though it was an innocent mistake also i think walmart has gmo sweet corn on the cob in the produce isle but when i asked the produce manager he looked on the box the corn was delivered in and since it didn’t say “genetically modified” he said they don’t have any gmo corn in the store the problem is that nothing in the us is labeled as gmo so everyone thinks they are not eating or buying gmo foods this is a tradgedy reply ↓ we must do our due diligence here before you begin purchasing a product call them and ask them i called the alexia brand criss cut sweet potatoes while standing in whole foods i asked them if their was any ” biotech” in their products and they confirmed it  i then went and complained to the managerto no avail apparently as whole foods stills sells that crap when they began selling the “backto nature packaged foods i called them again standing in trhe isle kraft asnwered the phone so i just hung up kraft like post general mills kellogs conagra and many others are “pushers” for monsanto so why bother reading them the riot act they’ve all heard it from me many times over if you cannot talk to someone at least by email then do not buy the product my  cents worth… reply ↓ and alexia is owned by conagra who donated  to prevent gmo labeling in california  reply ↓ well in  all food sold at whole foods will be labeled as either containing gmos or gmo free reply ↓ i heard that whole foods bowed to pressure from monsanto to rescind their pledge to not carry gmos i’d appreciate any links to whether or not this is true reply ↓ lesley this story from back in  was based on a comment made by the whole foods’ ceo in regard to a meeting they had with tom vilsack i think personally that the truth lies somewhere in the middle whole foods sent an email out that was most definitely not very clear about their stance indicating things like “gmos were prevalent” and “while we oppose we also recognize…” a copy of this email which originally appeared on their blog has since been removed which would indicate they at least recognized that it was poorly written or at most realized their error in making the statement the organic consumers association blasted them for not taking a stronger stance you can find the freshly minted whole foods’ positions about these issues on their blog more recently whole foods announced that all products on their shelves will have gmo labeling by  i give them kudos for setting a precedent and a big “hmm” for taking so long but then again i’ve never owned a national food chain so i can’t speak to the intricacies of carrying out such an order i have additional personal opinions about whole foods and trader joes that keep me shopping at another local organic coop chain in my area 🙂 reply ↓ thanks for the response i am ambivalent about wf too a new store is coming to my area in late  i watched wf absorb the absolutely splendid bread  circus

eggs they have started with eating “regular” feed which i believe may not be organic 😦 however this week they will be moving on to adult feed i am so thrilled to have found organic feed about   hrs from my house at hiland’s naturals interestingly they sell certified organic feed and nongmo feed when i asked the difference i found that the nongmo is not organic i think the best bet for us is the certified organic we will have organic healthy eggs in a couple months i have wondered if there have been tests on eggs that are not organic do traces of gmo toxins show up thanks again looking forward to eating more organic nongmo foods reply ↓ great to hear this can you share the name of the company  brand of this feed even better if you could post a photo of the bag to our facebook page that would be much appreciated httpwwwfacebookcomgmoawarenessusa reply ↓ thank you for the information you have provided i try to buy organic nongmo products but it is a daunting process at times all new information is helpful everyone needs to be aware of monsanto and what is happening in congress right now i hope that more and more people become aware of the dangers of gmo foods again thanks reply ↓ you are most welcome lisa thanks for writing reply ↓ we’ve been trying to go organic and now nongmo for over a year now our problem is that in a household such as ours the cost involved becomes prohibitive i’m working at building my business online with the largest percent of my earnings going toward food that is healthier for my family we live on disability here though this means that we’re often scraping by and don’t have the choice as to what brand to purchase it’s literally purchase what we can afford or the kids don’t get a sandwich etc it’s disheartening but i think the information here and in other sites iv’e found at least makes me feel like i’m not alone in caring and in desperately not wanting this food on my family table reply ↓ katrina bless you for trying you are not alone in the struggle with cost is it possible for you to grow a portion of your own food either in your back yard front yard containers or a local “pea patch” community garden perhaps here’s a link for safe nongmo seeds another great tip is costco… they are starting to stock more and more organic products and produce i took photos of the organics i found on a recent visit it never hurts to talk to their managers and ask for more… they are definitely a company that responds to input from their customers last but not least i saw a great article on foodbabe’s blog not too long ago listing  tips for eating organic on a budget… my guess is you are already doing a lot of these but perhaps there are a few that might be new to you very best of luck and my sincere kudos to you for your efforts reply ↓ i’m actually going to try my hand at a garden for the first time ever this year yikes and can’t wait to check out the other links you shared thanks for the encouragement small big

gm free i was crushed when i heard that costco’s organic green beans are actually from china and leads me to wonder how to tell what else is in the maze of things out there my most frustrating challenge has been the “processed or packaged in usa” that costco trader joe’s and many other stores are carrying i love costco and hope you can tell me some good news about the organics being sold there reply ↓ bailey i love how costco has been bringing in more and more organics making it more affordable for the average family to eat healthy food that said i am less convinced that their organic produce is at a standard i am personally willing to purchase i have been sticking to the usda organic labeled packages on brands that i recognize annie’s nature’s path etc as for china that is a topic i’ve been slowly gathering research on… and it hasn’t been easy to get to the bottom of the story they do have organic standards in place but they are even more convoluted than the us’ standards to read much less interpret and i can’t find any confidence in their enforcement in their defense china recently told brazil they want gmofree soy… so we know the intentions are there i’m just not sure

reply ↓ i was very impressed with your site until i came to the big promo for nongmo project your false statement that eating “products certified by the nongmo project    assures that you are eating gmofree food” calls into question the accuracy and truthfulness of all the other information you provide here how can you make such a reckless claim when nongmo project’s own website specifies that their “verified” seal does not mean the product is gmofree see httpwwwnongmoprojectorglearnmoreunderstandingourseal furthermore organic consumers association and others have revealed that the test results data and related information which nongmo project supposedly utilizes are all secret and can never be released publicly by contractual agreement with the corporations that pay them for their label we don’t even know who conducts the tests oca has called nongmo project a greenwashing operation i will watch for your reply hoping you will amend your recommendation and plead that you made an honest mistake reply ↓ thanks for your comment i take your use of the words “reckless” and “recommendation” quite seriously i’m puzzled why you feel this article is a promo piece for the nongmo project the intent is to provide consumers with an overview of all of the labeling methods that apply to identifying gmo free products allow me to excerpt several statements from this article under the header “buying usda organic  gmo free…” first paragraph “as explained above buying usda organic is by no means a failsafe however at this point in time usda organic remains one of the best and most easilyidentifiable ways of assuring that you are eating gmofree foods most of the time” second paragraph “want to take it one step further buy products that are also certified by the nongmo project” note the use of the word “also” “the certification process behind this label is currently the best possible way of assuring that you are eating gmofree food though bear in mind not all of the products bearing the nongmo project label are organic—for the best of both worlds chose products that also include the usda organic label note my reference to the certification process–which goes beyond what the usda organic certification process does my use of the word ‘also’ indicates that a manufacturer has taken the time to go through two separate certification processes–something i personally find to be an indicator of added attention to gmos… versus an assurance of no gmos as you interpreted the paragraph to imply third paragraph since you reference the nongmo project’s website in your comment i’m surprised you missed my reference to it here “sadly however just like organic certification the word “usually” once again comes into play the nongmo project’s website clearly states that its label does not guarantee a product is  gmofree because contamination is an evergrowing threat so what does the label really mean” contamination is discussed at length prior to this third paragraph we reference it again here to illustrate that both labeling methods–usda organic and nongmo project–are still susceptible to contamination regarding your statement about secret test results and “who conducts the tests” you can request and receive test results directly from the nongmo project i have on several occasions they include a list of the labs and resources that perform their testing on their website this does not make me a fan of them any more than i am a fan of the usda they and the usda are simply the two main certification agencies  processes that we have currently available to us as consumers in summary no process is failsafe as i state in this article i’ve seen the test reports on products that were previously certified by the nongmo project that later came back contaminated this is the world we live in the purpose of article is to help consumers navigate that world realistically in an informed manner in the best way they can in light of and in spite of the processes that are being used today reply ↓ you’re puzzled i was clear the first time again your statement — that nongmo project certification assures “you are eating gmofree food” — is false again nongmo project itself says their label does not mean a product is “gmofree” one has to dig for that information but it’s there and i linked you to that page on nongmo project’s website it’s your use of the term “gmofree” that’s at issue here this is an important point and one that cannot be glossed over a food product carrying the nongmo project seal may well contain gmos in fact even when testing clearly shows the presence of gmos nongmo project may still provide their nongmo project “verified” label again they say so on their website this is quite the opposite of what any consumer who sees that seal is reasonably likely to believe after all other food labels that say “nongmo” do indeed mean the product contains no gmos it’s only nongmo project which by adding the word “project” drains the original meaning from the term nongmo and transforms it into something entirely different it’s not unlike the way some companies use the word “natural” on the labels of their gmo frankenfoods in an effort to mislead consumers with a term that appears to mean one thing but in fact means something else your statement that nongmo project’s label is “the best possible way” of assuring you are eating gmofree food only compounds the problem now if your intentions are to accurately inform your readers you should remove all references linking nongmo project to any “gmofree” claims you should also publish a correction to your article stating your original text was misleading and not only is the nongmo project label no guarantee that a product is  gmofree in fact nongmo project explicitly rejects the use of the term “gmofree” and their label is not intended to mean the product contains no gmos quite unlike the usda organic label i should mention that your portrayal of nongmo project’s seal as somehow equivalent to or even superior to the usda organic label is quite unfortunate for anyone interested cornucopia institute has some incisive information on that subject sign up for their free email newsletters as to the secrecy of nongmo project test data you say you have received some i notice you do not identify yourself except to say you have a “background in regulatory affairs and biotechnology” the truth is many independent scientists and others not associated with biotech companies or the institutions they fund are being denied this data if the data is indeed available to the public as you say you are free to publish it on your site will you do that i don’t think you will because that data is not to be released publicly in other words it’s secret

reply ↓ pingback usda organic vs nongmo labeling it’s complicated – sustainable scoop i still think that this is a good article for general reference i was looking for an overview on if organic

product is labeled ‘ organic’ ‘organic’ or just ‘made with organic ingredients’ then even the nonorganic ingredients cannot be produced from gmos for example products labeled as ‘made with organic ingredients’ only require  of the ingredients to be organic but  must be nongmo” organic means gmofree whether there is an additional “gmofree” label on the product or not in the us a seller can’t claim a product is “organic” unless that product meets usda standards sellers can claim “natural” and “beyond organic” and “pesticidefree” and “pastured” etc and none of those are necessarily gmofree unless that is stated on the product i trust the nongmo project verified label since that project is supported by jeffrey smithirt gmo contamination is the only thing a farmer cannot predict or in most cases prevent until after the fact nothing is guaranteed in life as far as gmos in my food supply i shop with my local farmers who i have met i growraise more and more of my own food and i decide which labels i will trust short of being on the farm at some point you have to gather the evidence and trust reply ↓ i couldn’t agree with you more sally 🙂 reply ↓ my store assures me the if there is an “organic” label with the  on the sticker it’s organic though not necessarily fda certified … in this case apples is this true reply ↓ yes if it’s a  digit code starting with  it is indeed organic however this  digit code will not tell you if the product is gmo… because this code system is not mandatory gmo producers  manufacturers are not using it more info here httpwwwhuffingtonpostcomjeffreysmithplucodesdonotindicatebhtml reply ↓ all this article tells me is that nothing is  gmo free because of cross contamination there will always be trace amounts all we can do as consumers is limit our exposure even the companies who claimed they did not support monsanto still had trace amounts in their products do we even know what a limited exposure will do to us

compost if you aren’t starting  using your own presumably organic compost bin avoid getting manure from farms that spray pesticides on their fields andor feed their chickenscows gmo grain i’ve also

great site 🙂 reply ↓ boy if only we had the answer to that question… at least the first two qualities are a moot point usda organic  gmofree but adding in the soy factor does seem to confuse both the producers  labelers as well as we poor consumers hopefully with more and more naturopaths encouraging patients to find soyfree eggs as part of a gradual elimination diet process the demand will spark

looking for nongmo should consider nongmo project verification to be of a higher standard than usda organic the latter sets no thresholds for inadvertent contamination and you will not lose your organic standards due to it that is to say if you are following all the guidelines set in the standards and your crop is contaminated inadvertently you’re good to go nongmo project verification sets the same standards for contamination found in places like eu and china which is no more than  if you have inadvertent contamination you will lose your right to the nongmo project verified seal in your annual testing of course there are other reasons to choose organic other than nongmo but if your primary goal is to choose nongmo foods then the project is the  label you should be looking for then

taking fluoride arsenic and other harmful chemicals out of water since those enter our organic crops since they don’t regulate the water the most important part food and water are our greatest natural resource and we need to treat it that way and cherish it more than gold how was it a huge problem to use stem cells for research but they can genetically modify your food america  we should be outraged at the people behind this as bill gates claims we need population control and is the biggest contributor to monsanto the largest gmo company and gmos have caused infertility in lab rats in later generations this is an attack on the american people we need to fight back and end this see how hard it is to find  non gmo foods monsanto went to courts and had a judge sign a document that states if any crop – including organics crops get contaminated from a gmo crop that monsanto now owns it under legal authority and just look up cross contamination idk if you have ever grown a crop but their are male and female plants the females have nodes or basically vaginas where the pollen or sperm can enter the male plants have balls which produce pollen which is very light and bees winds bugs pretty much everything in the air takes it places if you have one male plant in your crop of females they will all get seeds aparantley the cross contamination is out of control with monsanto crops simply because pollen is impossible to control they can literally end real food legally too how are people ok with this i read this stuff and my blood boils i get so enraged i want to do everything i can to change this shit it’s barbaric so maybe that’s the only way we can act to take these corporations down then again mass awareness is the only way to start social change reply ↓

label allows for about lb of gmo ingredients for every lb is that not relevant what this label is doing is to devalue organic products which should at the moment be the only products that are of actually zero gmo content the nongmo project label also sneaks gmos under a “healthy” type of label that should simply not exist what should exists is a no gmo label that allows zero gmo content or a gmo inside label only one of these would be honest and clear about gmo content and provide the informed or uninformed customer with a way to avoid gmos completely i find the nongmo project label to be a misleading marketing gimmick that is unnecessary and effective only to add value where it isn’t needed for the sake of more sales of course as per the nongmo project’s website “we use an action threshold of  this is in alignment with laws in the european union where any product containing more than  gmo must be labeled absence of all gmos is the target for all nongmo project standard compliant products continuous improvement practices toward achieving this goal must be part of the participant’s quality management systems” source httpwwwnongmoprojectorglearnmoreunderstandingourseal reply ↓ in response to the person who asked about imported cheese from europe i read in more than one place that in such cases they sell their gmo free cheese to their own but to the us they sell gmo cheese so we cannot assume it’s gmo free without the label saying so just because it is imported unfortunately they are already making gmo free cheese why can’t they just extend that to us why consciously feed americans poison my guess is because it’s cheaper higher profits from the us market we don’t have the label to turn us off whereas in europe they have the gmo label still shame on

someone here mentioned that greed is the underlying problem behind all of the problems in our food chain the inherent weakness of capitalism is the fact that corporations are beholden to its shareholders unfortunately the primary reason why someone invests in a corporation is to have increased dividend payments increased equity value or a combination of both here corporations have two options  decrease costs andor  increase sales a corporation increases sales by basically giving the consumers what they want a cheaper product with a higher value proposition however said corporation has to keep the investors shareholders happy so they have to maintain their profits while producing that cheaper product in order for them to maintain profits they have to decrease its costs in producing the product it’s a vicious cycle that is fed by the system but the reality is that we the consumer are ultimately responsible for this problem we are demanding our products for cheaper and we strive to justify the reduced cost by turning a blind eye to the idea that somewhere in the supply chain corners are being cut to supply this product this is something that extends to all industries food clothing transportation housing etc we have become so used to paying pennies for a crappy product that when we see a product that is more expensive we think that product is a ripoff yes there are impoverished communities that can’t afford more but these communities are spelling their own demise by shopping at the walmarts the fact is that the farms can’t survive by being completely clean it simply costs too much and in the end the consumers don’t care enough to pay the extra amount it takes to produce the clean product reply ↓ pingback can gmo foods also be organic
