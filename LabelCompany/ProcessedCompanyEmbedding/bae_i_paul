american corporations boeing and mcdonnell douglas which followed the forming of lockheed martin the worlds largest defence contractor in  increased the pressure on european defence companies to consolidate in june  british aerospace defence managing director john weston commented europe is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the us european governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity a european aerospace and defence company as early as  british aerospace and the german aerospace and defence company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company the two companies envisaged including aérospatiale the other major european aerospace company but only after its privatisation the first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of airbus from a consortium of british aerospace dasa aérospatiale and construcciones aeronáuticas sa into an integrated company in this aim british aerospace and dasa were united against the various objections of aérospatiale as well as airbus british aerospace and dasa were partners in the panavia tornado and eurofighter typhoon aircraft projects merger discussions began between british aerospace and dasa in july  just as french participation became more likely with the announcement that aérospatiale was to merge with matra and emerge with a diluted french government shareholding a merger was agreed between british aerospace chairman richard evans and dasa ceo jürgen schrempp in december  meanwhile gec was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation reporting the appointment of george simpson as gec managing director in  the independent had said some analysts believe that mr simpsons inside knowledge of bae a longrumoured gec bid target was a key to his appointment gec favours forging a national champion defence group with bae to compete with the giant us organisations when gec put mes up for sale on  december  british aerospace abandoned the dasa merger in favour of purchasing its british rival the merger of british aerospace and mes was announced on  january  evans stated that in  that his fear was that an american defence contractor would acquire mes and challenge both british aerospace and dasa the merger created a vertically integrated company which the scotsman described as a combination of british aerospaces contracting and platformbuilding skills with marconis coveted electronics systems capability for example combining the manufacturer of the eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircrafts electronic systems british aerospace was mes largest customer in contrast dasas response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with aérospatiale to create the european aeronautic defence and space company eads a horizontal integration eads has since considered a merger with thales to create a fully rounded company seventeen undertakings were given by bae systems to the department of trade and industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the monopolies and mergers commission these were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender subcontracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries another condition was the firewalling of former british aerospace and mes teams on defence projects such as the joint strike fighter jsf in  the government on advice from the office of fair trading announced it had agreed to release bae systems from ten of the undertakings due to a change in circumstances bae systems inherited the uk government owned golden share that was established when british aerospace was privatised this unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the companys articles of association without the permission of the secretary of state these articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than  of the companys shares or control the majority of the board and that the ceo and the chairman of bae systems must be british nationals british aerospaces head office was in warwick house farnborough aerospace centre in farnborough hampshire bae systems retains this but the registered office and base for the senior leadership team is in the city of westminster sedit bae systems first annual report identified airbus support services to militaries and integrated systems for air land and naval applications as key areas of growth it also stated the companys desire to both expand in the us and participate in further consolidation in europe bae systems described  as an important year for its european joint ventures which were reorganised considerably the company has described the rationale for expansion in the us it is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the western european nations combined importantly us investment in research and development is significantly higher than in western europe when dick olver was appointed chairman in july  he ordered a review of the companys businesses which ruled out further european acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a strategic bias for expansion and investment in the us the review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and with two acquisitions in  and  bae moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world this shift in strategy was described as remarkable by the financial times between  and early  bae acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on traditional defence items such as warships and tanks in  matra marconi space a joint bae systemsmatra company was merged with the space division of dasa to form astrium on  june  bae sold its  share to eads for £ million however due to the lossmaking status of the company bae systems invested an equal amount for restructuring in january  airbus industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company bae systems sold its  majority share of bae systems canada an electronics company in april for ca approx £ million as of december  in november  the company announced the closure of the avro regional jet avro rj production line at woodford and the cancellation of the avro rjx an advanced series of the aircraft family as the business was no longer viable the final avro rj to be completed became the last british civil airliner in november  bae sold its  share of thomson marconi sonar to thales for £ million a further step of european defence consolidation was the merger of baes share of matra bae dynamics and the missile division of alenia marconi systems ams into mbda in december mbda thus became the worlds second largest missile manufacturer although eads has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of mbda bae has said that unlike airbus mbda is a core business the astuteclass submarine project caused bae to issue a profit warning in  and invest £ million to overcome its difficulties in june  bae systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with trw an american aerospace automotive and defence business this was prompted by northrop grummans £ billion approx us billion c  hostile bid for trw in february  a bidding war between bae systems northrop and general dynamics ended on  june when northrops increased bid of £ billion was accepted on  december  the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the nimrod mra maritime reconnaissanceattack aircraft and the astuteclass submarine projects on  february  bae took a charge of £ million against these projects and the ministry of defence mod agreed to pay a further £ million of the cost in  the company had taken a £ million loss charge on the nimrod contract which was expected to cover all the costs of completion of the current contract the uk government following a cabinet row described as one of the most bitter cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the westland helicopter affair in  ordered  bae hawk trainer aircraft with  options in july  in a deal worth £ million the deal was significant because it was a factor in indias decision to finalise a £ billion order for  hawks in march  also in july  bae systems and finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies to be collectively known as eurosystems these companies would have pooled the avionics cistar and communications businesses of the two companies however the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a reevaluation of the proposal bae systems  annual report states that recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed eurosystems transaction with finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model the main part of this deal was the dissolution of ams and the establishment of selex sensors and airborne systems bae systems sold its  share of the latter to finmeccanica for € million approx £ million c  in march  in may  it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions bae systems naval ships and bae systems submarines it was understood that general dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at barrowinfurness while vt group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the clyde however in  bae systems merged its surface fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of vt group to form bvt surface fleet an aim central to the british governments defence industrial strategy baes £ billion purchase of united defense in  added the mm bradley family of armoured vehicles to its product line on  june  bae systems outbid general dynamics for alvis vickers the uks main manufacturer of armoured vehicles alvis vickers was merged with the companys ro defence unit to form bae systems land systems recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to general dynamics bae systems executives soon identified the us defence company united defense industries udi a major competitor to general dynamics as a main acquisition target on  march  bae announced the £ billion approx us billion c  acquisition of udi udi now bae systems land and armaments manufactures combat vehicles artillery systems naval guns missile launchers and precision guided munitions in december  bae systems announced the sale of its german naval systems subsidiary atlas elektronik to thyssenkrupp and eads the sale was complicated by the requirement of the german government to approve any sale the financial times described the sale as cut price because french company thales bid € million but was blocked from purchasing atlas on national security grounds on  january  the company announced the sale of bae systems aerostructures to spirit aerosystems inc having said as early as  that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a core business on  august  saudi arabia signed a contract worth £ billion to £ billion for  eurofighter typhoons to be delivered by bae systems on  september  the company was awarded a £ billion contract for the upgrade of  royal saudi air force tornado idss one of bae systems major aims as highlighted in the  annual report was the granting of increased technology transfer between the uk and the us the f jsf programme became the focus of this effort with british government ministers such as lord drayson minister for defence procurement suggesting the uk would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the uk to operate and maintain fs independently however on  december  lord drayson signed an agreement which allows an unbroken british chain of command for operation of the aircraft on  december  bae received a £ million contract to provide guaranteed availability of royal air force raf tornados on  may  the company announced its subsidiary bae systems inc was to purchase armor holdings for £ billion approx us billion c  and completed the deal on  july  the company is a

repeated suggestions as early as  that bae systems wished to sell its  share of airbus the possibility was consistently denied by the company however on  april  bbc news reported that it was indeed to

£m criminal fines to the us and £m to the uk the uk had already massively benefited from £ billion contract in tax receipts and jobs in the uk and dropped an anticorruption investigation into the al

american corporations boeing and mcdonnell douglas which followed the forming of lockheed martin the worlds largest defence contractor in  increased the pressure on european defence companies to consolidate in june  british aerospace defence managing director john weston commented europe is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the us european governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity a european aerospace and defence company as early as  british aerospace and the german aerospace and defence company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company the two companies envisaged including aérospatiale the other major european aerospace company but only after its privatisation the first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of airbus from a consortium of british aerospace dasa aérospatiale and construcciones aeronáuticas sa into an integrated company in this aim british aerospace and dasa were united against the various objections of aérospatiale as well as airbus british aerospace and dasa were partners in the panavia tornado and eurofighter typhoon aircraft projects merger discussions began between british aerospace and dasa in july  just as french participation became more likely with the announcement that aérospatiale was to merge with matra and emerge with a diluted french government shareholding a merger was agreed between british aerospace chairman richard evans and dasa ceo jürgen schrempp in december  meanwhile gec was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation reporting the appointment of george simpson as gec managing director in  the independent had said some analysts believe that mr simpsons inside knowledge of bae a longrumoured gec bid target was a key to his appointment gec favours forging a national champion defence group with bae to compete with the giant us organisations when gec put mes up for sale on  december  british aerospace abandoned the dasa merger in favour of purchasing its british rival the merger of british aerospace and mes was announced on  january  evans stated that in  that his fear was that an american defence contractor would acquire mes and challenge both british aerospace and dasa the merger created a vertically integrated company which the scotsman described as a combination of british aerospaces contracting and platformbuilding skills with marconis coveted electronics systems capability for example combining the manufacturer of the eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircrafts electronic systems british aerospace was mes largest customer in contrast dasas response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with aérospatiale to create the european aeronautic defence and space company eads a horizontal integration eads has since considered a merger with thales to create a fully rounded company seventeen undertakings were given by bae systems to the department of trade and industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the monopolies and mergers commission these were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender subcontracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries another condition was the firewalling of former british aerospace and mes teams on defence projects such as the joint strike fighter jsf in  the government on advice from the office of fair trading announced it had agreed to release bae systems from ten of the undertakings due to a change in circumstances bae systems inherited the uk government owned golden share that was established when british aerospace was privatised this unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the companys articles of association without the permission of the secretary of state these articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than  of the companys shares or control the majority of the board and that the ceo and the chairman of bae systems must be british nationals british aerospaces head office was in warwick house farnborough aerospace centre in farnborough hampshire bae systems retains this but the registered office and base for the senior leadership team is in the city of westminster sedit bae systems first annual report identified airbus support services to militaries and integrated systems for air land and naval applications as key areas of growth it also stated the companys desire to both expand in the us and participate in further consolidation in europe bae systems described  as an important year for its european joint ventures which were reorganised considerably the company has described the rationale for expansion in the us it is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the western european nations combined importantly us investment in research and development is significantly higher than in western europe when dick olver was appointed chairman in july  he ordered a review of the companys businesses which ruled out further european acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a strategic bias for expansion and investment in the us the review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and with two acquisitions in  and  bae moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world this shift in strategy was described as remarkable by the financial times between  and early  bae acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on traditional defence items such as warships and tanks in  matra marconi space a joint bae systemsmatra company was merged with the space division of dasa to form astrium on  june  bae sold its  share to eads for £ million however due to the lossmaking status of the company bae systems invested an equal amount for restructuring in january  airbus industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company bae systems sold its  majority share of bae systems canada an electronics company in april for ca approx £ million as of december  in november  the company announced the closure of the avro regional jet avro rj production line at woodford and the cancellation of the avro rjx an advanced series of the aircraft family as the business was no longer viable the final avro rj to be completed became the last british civil airliner in november  bae sold its  share of thomson marconi sonar to thales for £ million a further step of european defence consolidation was the merger of baes share of matra bae dynamics and the missile division of alenia marconi systems ams into mbda in december mbda thus became the worlds second largest missile manufacturer although eads has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of mbda bae has said that unlike airbus mbda is a core business the astuteclass submarine project caused bae to issue a profit warning in  and invest £ million to overcome its difficulties in june  bae systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with trw an american aerospace automotive and defence business this was prompted by northrop grummans £ billion approx us billion c  hostile bid for trw in february  a bidding war between bae systems northrop and general dynamics ended on  june when northrops increased bid of £ billion was accepted on  december  the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the nimrod mra maritime reconnaissanceattack aircraft and the astuteclass submarine projects on  february  bae took a charge of £ million against these projects and the ministry of defence mod agreed to pay a further £ million of the cost in  the company had taken a £ million loss charge on the nimrod contract which was expected to cover all the costs of completion of the current contract the uk government following a cabinet row described as one of the most bitter cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the westland helicopter affair in  ordered  bae hawk trainer aircraft with  options in july  in a deal worth £ million the deal was significant because it was a factor in indias decision to finalise a £ billion order for  hawks in march  also in july  bae systems and finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies to be collectively known as eurosystems these companies would have pooled the avionics cistar and communications businesses of the two companies however the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a reevaluation of the proposal bae systems  annual report states that recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed eurosystems transaction with finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model the main part of this deal was the dissolution of ams and the establishment of selex sensors and airborne systems bae systems sold its  share of the latter to finmeccanica for € million approx £ million c  in march  in may  it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions bae systems naval ships and bae systems submarines it was understood that general dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at barrowinfurness while vt group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the clyde however in  bae systems merged its surface fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of vt group to form bvt surface fleet an aim central to the british governments defence industrial strategy baes £ billion purchase of united defense in  added the mm bradley family of armoured vehicles to its product line on  june  bae systems outbid general dynamics for alvis vickers the uks main manufacturer of armoured vehicles alvis vickers was merged with the companys ro defence unit to form bae systems land systems recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to general dynamics bae systems executives soon identified the us defence company united defense industries udi a major competitor to general dynamics as a main acquisition target on  march  bae announced the £ billion approx us billion c  acquisition of udi udi now bae systems land and armaments manufactures combat vehicles artillery systems naval guns missile launchers and precision guided munitions in december  bae systems announced the sale of its german naval systems subsidiary atlas elektronik to thyssenkrupp and eads the sale was complicated by the requirement of the german government to approve any sale the financial times described the sale as cut price because french company thales bid € million but was blocked from purchasing atlas on national security grounds on  january  the company announced the sale of bae systems aerostructures to spirit aerosystems inc having said as early as  that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a core business on  august  saudi arabia signed a contract worth £ billion to £ billion for  eurofighter typhoons to be delivered by bae systems on  september  the company was awarded a £ billion contract for the upgrade of  royal saudi air force tornado idss one of bae systems major aims as highlighted in the  annual report was the granting of increased technology transfer between the uk and the us the f jsf programme became the focus of this effort with british government ministers such as lord drayson minister for defence procurement suggesting the uk would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the uk to operate and maintain fs independently however on  december  lord drayson signed an agreement which allows an unbroken british chain of command for operation of the aircraft on  december  bae received a £ million contract to provide guaranteed availability of royal air force raf tornados on  may  the company announced its subsidiary bae systems inc was to purchase armor holdings for £ billion approx us billion c  and completed the deal on  july  the company is a

was incorporated as airbus sas a joint stock company in return for a  share in the new company bae systems transferred ownership of its airbus plants known as airbus uk to the new company despite repeated suggestions as early as  that bae systems wished to sell its  share of airbus the possibility was consistently denied by the company however on  april  bbc news reported that it was indeed to sell its stake then conservatively valued at £ billion due to the slow pace of informal negotiations bae systems exercised its put option which saw investment bank rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation six days after this process began airbus announced delays to the a with significant effects on the value of airbus shares on  june  rothschild valued the companys share at

turner said in  we had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldnt have taken these competition rules were introduced by lord levene during the s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to cost plus contracts where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit bae systems was operating in the only truly

american corporations boeing and mcdonnell douglas which followed the forming of lockheed martin the worlds largest defence contractor in  increased the pressure on european defence companies to consolidate in june  british aerospace defence managing director john weston commented europe is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the us european governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity a european aerospace and defence company as early as  british aerospace and the german aerospace and defence company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company the two companies envisaged including aérospatiale the other major european aerospace company but only after its privatisation the first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of airbus from a consortium of british aerospace dasa aérospatiale and construcciones aeronáuticas sa into an integrated company in this aim british aerospace and dasa were united against the various objections of aérospatiale as well as airbus british aerospace and dasa were partners in the panavia tornado and eurofighter typhoon aircraft projects merger discussions began between british aerospace and dasa in july  just as french participation became more likely with the announcement that aérospatiale was to merge with matra and emerge with a diluted french government shareholding a merger was agreed between british aerospace chairman richard evans and dasa ceo jürgen schrempp in december  meanwhile gec was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation reporting the appointment of george simpson as gec managing director in  the independent had said some analysts believe that mr simpsons inside knowledge of bae a longrumoured gec bid target was a key to his appointment gec favours forging a national champion defence group with bae to compete with the giant us organisations when gec put mes up for sale on  december  british aerospace abandoned the dasa merger in favour of purchasing its british rival the merger of british aerospace and mes was announced on  january  evans stated that in  that his fear was that an american defence contractor would acquire mes and challenge both british aerospace and dasa the merger created a vertically integrated company which the scotsman described as a combination of british aerospaces contracting and platformbuilding skills with marconis coveted electronics systems capability for example combining the manufacturer of the eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircrafts electronic systems british aerospace was mes largest customer in contrast dasas response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with aérospatiale to create the european aeronautic defence and space company eads a horizontal integration eads has since considered a merger with thales to create a fully rounded company seventeen undertakings were given by bae systems to the department of trade and industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the monopolies and mergers commission these were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender subcontracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries another condition was the firewalling of former british aerospace and mes teams on defence projects such as the joint strike fighter jsf in  the government on advice from the office of fair trading announced it had agreed to release bae systems from ten of the undertakings due to a change in circumstances bae systems inherited the uk government owned golden share that was established when british aerospace was privatised this unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the companys articles of association without the permission of the secretary of state these articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than  of the companys shares or control the majority of the board and that the ceo and the chairman of bae systems must be british nationals british aerospaces head office was in warwick house farnborough aerospace centre in farnborough hampshire bae systems retains this but the registered office and base for the senior leadership team is in the city of westminster sedit bae systems first annual report identified airbus support services to militaries and integrated systems for air land and naval applications as key areas of growth it also stated the companys desire to both expand in the us and participate in further consolidation in europe bae systems described  as an important year for its european joint ventures which were reorganised considerably the company has described the rationale for expansion in the us it is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the western european nations combined importantly us investment in research and development is significantly higher than in western europe when dick olver was appointed chairman in july  he ordered a review of the companys businesses which ruled out further european acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a strategic bias for expansion and investment in the us the review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and with two acquisitions in  and  bae moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world this shift in strategy was described as remarkable by the financial times between  and early  bae acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on traditional defence items such as warships and tanks in  matra marconi space a joint bae systemsmatra company was merged with the space division of dasa to form astrium on  june  bae sold its  share to eads for £ million however due to the lossmaking status of the company bae systems invested an equal amount for restructuring in january  airbus industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company bae systems sold its  majority share of bae systems canada an electronics company in april for ca approx £ million as of december  in november  the company announced the closure of the avro regional jet avro rj production line at woodford and the cancellation of the avro rjx an advanced series of the aircraft family as the business was no longer viable the final avro rj to be completed became the last british civil airliner in november  bae sold its  share of thomson marconi sonar to thales for £ million a further step of european defence consolidation was the merger of baes share of matra bae dynamics and the missile division of alenia marconi systems ams into mbda in december mbda thus became the worlds second largest missile manufacturer although eads has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of mbda bae has said that unlike airbus mbda is a core business the astuteclass submarine project caused bae to issue a profit warning in  and invest £ million to overcome its difficulties in june  bae systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with trw an american aerospace automotive and defence business this was prompted by northrop grummans £ billion approx us billion c  hostile bid for trw in february  a bidding war between bae systems northrop and general dynamics ended on  june when northrops increased bid of £ billion was accepted on  december  the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the nimrod mra maritime reconnaissanceattack aircraft and the astuteclass submarine projects on  february  bae took a charge of £ million against these projects and the ministry of defence mod agreed to pay a further £ million of the cost in  the company had taken a £ million loss charge on the nimrod contract which was expected to cover all the costs of completion of the current contract the uk government following a cabinet row described as one of the most bitter cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the westland helicopter affair in  ordered  bae hawk trainer aircraft with  options in july  in a deal worth £ million the deal was significant because it was a factor in indias decision to finalise a £ billion order for  hawks in march  also in july  bae systems and finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies to be collectively known as eurosystems these companies would have pooled the avionics cistar and communications businesses of the two companies however the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a reevaluation of the proposal bae systems  annual report states that recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed eurosystems transaction with finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model the main part of this deal was the dissolution of ams and the establishment of selex sensors and airborne systems bae systems sold its  share of the latter to finmeccanica for € million approx £ million c  in march  in may  it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions bae systems naval ships and bae systems submarines it was understood that general dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at barrowinfurness while vt group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the clyde however in  bae systems merged its surface fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of vt group to form bvt surface fleet an aim central to the british governments defence industrial strategy baes £ billion purchase of united defense in  added the mm bradley family of armoured vehicles to its product line on  june  bae systems outbid general dynamics for alvis vickers the uks main manufacturer of armoured vehicles alvis vickers was merged with the companys ro defence unit to form bae systems land systems recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to general dynamics bae systems executives soon identified the us defence company united defense industries udi a major competitor to general dynamics as a main acquisition target on  march  bae announced the £ billion approx us billion c  acquisition of udi udi now bae systems land and armaments manufactures combat vehicles artillery systems naval guns missile launchers and precision guided munitions in december  bae systems announced the sale of its german naval systems subsidiary atlas elektronik to thyssenkrupp and eads the sale was complicated by the requirement of the german government to approve any sale the financial times described the sale as cut price because french company thales bid € million but was blocked from purchasing atlas on national security grounds on  january  the company announced the sale of bae systems aerostructures to spirit aerosystems inc having said as early as  that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a core business on  august  saudi arabia signed a contract worth £ billion to £ billion for  eurofighter typhoons to be delivered by bae systems on  september  the company was awarded a £ billion contract for the upgrade of  royal saudi air force tornado idss one of bae systems major aims as highlighted in the  annual report was the granting of increased technology transfer between the uk and the us the f jsf programme became the focus of this effort with british government ministers such as lord drayson minister for defence procurement suggesting the uk would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the uk to operate and maintain fs independently however on  december  lord drayson signed an agreement which allows an unbroken british chain of command for operation of the aircraft on  december  bae received a £ million contract to provide guaranteed availability of royal air force raf tornados on  may  the company announced its subsidiary bae systems inc was to purchase armor holdings for £ billion approx us billion c  and completed the deal on  july  the company is a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies bae systems and british aerospace previously was a technology partner to the mclaren formula one team from  to december  the partnership originally focused on mclarens f cars aerodynamics eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques wireless systems and fuel management bae systems main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of mclaren the company announced the acquisition of tenix defence a major australian defence contractor on  january  the purchase was completed on  june for a million £ million making bae systems australia that countrys largest defence contractor the uk ministry of defence awarded bae systems a year munitions contract in august  worth up to £ billion and known as mass the contract guarantees supply of  of the uk armed forces ammunition and required bae to modernise its munitions manufacturing facilities bae systems expanded its intelligence and security business with the £ million purchase of detica group in july  it continued this strategy with purchases of danish cyber and intelligence company eti for approximately  million in december  and norkom group plc the following month for € million the latter provides counter fraud and antimoney laundering solutions

systems inherited british aerospaces share of airbus industrie which consisted of two factories at broughton and filton these facilities manufactured wings for the airbus family of aircraft in  airbus was incorporated as airbus sas a joint stock company in return for a  share in the new company bae systems transferred ownership of its airbus plants known as airbus uk to the new company despite repeated suggestions as early as  that bae systems wished to sell its  share of airbus the possibility was consistently denied by the company however on  april  bbc news reported that it was indeed to sell its stake then conservatively valued at £ billion due to the slow pace of informal negotiations bae systems exercised its put option which saw investment bank rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation six days after this process began airbus announced delays to the a with significant effects on the value of airbus shares on  june  rothschild valued the companys share at £ billion well below its own analysts and even eads expectations the bae systems board recommended that the company proceed with the sale on  october  shareholders voted in favour and the sale was completed on  october bae systems sale of its airbus share saw the end of uk owned involvement in civil airliner production airbus operations ltd the former airbus uk continues to be the airbus centre of excellence for wing production employing over  but is entirely owned by the airbus group formerly eads sedit in february  bae systems announced a £ million writedown of the former armor holdings

performer of bae systems subsidiaries growing from sales of £ million in  to £ billion in  bae systems inherited british aerospaces  share of saab ab with which it produced and marketed the gripen fighter aircraft in  it reduced this share to  and in march  announced its intention to sell the remainder the times stated that the decision brought to an end its controversial relationship with the gripen fighter aircraft several of the export campaigns for the aircraft were subject to allegations of bribery and corruption meanwhile the company was increasing its presence in india with the formation of defence land systems india in april a joint venture with mahindra  mahindra limited bae systems holds just  of the equity due to indian foreign direct investment regulations the company

turner said in  we had entered into contracts under the old competition rules that frankly we shouldnt have taken these competition rules were introduced by lord levene during the s to shift the burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to cost plus contracts where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit bae systems was operating in the only truly

american corporations boeing and mcdonnell douglas which followed the forming of lockheed martin the worlds largest defence contractor in  increased the pressure on european defence companies to consolidate in june  british aerospace defence managing director john weston commented europe is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the us european governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity a european aerospace and defence company as early as  british aerospace and the german aerospace and defence company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company the two companies envisaged including aérospatiale the other major european aerospace company but only after its privatisation the first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of airbus from a consortium of british aerospace dasa aérospatiale and construcciones aeronáuticas sa into an integrated company in this aim british aerospace and dasa were united against the various objections of aérospatiale as well as airbus british aerospace and dasa were partners in the panavia tornado and eurofighter typhoon aircraft projects merger discussions began between british aerospace and dasa in july  just as french participation became more likely with the announcement that aérospatiale was to merge with matra and emerge with a diluted french government shareholding a merger was agreed between british aerospace chairman richard evans and dasa ceo jürgen schrempp in december  meanwhile gec was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation reporting the appointment of george simpson as gec managing director in  the independent had said some analysts believe that mr simpsons inside knowledge of bae a longrumoured gec bid target was a key to his appointment gec favours forging a national champion defence group with bae to compete with the giant us organisations when gec put mes up for sale on  december  british aerospace abandoned the dasa merger in favour of purchasing its british rival the merger of british aerospace and mes was announced on  january  evans stated that in  that his fear was that an american defence contractor would acquire mes and challenge both british aerospace and dasa the merger created a vertically integrated company which the scotsman described as a combination of british aerospaces contracting and platformbuilding skills with marconis coveted electronics systems capability for example combining the manufacturer of the eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircrafts electronic systems british aerospace was mes largest customer in contrast dasas response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with aérospatiale to create the european aeronautic defence and space company eads a horizontal integration eads has since considered a merger with thales to create a fully rounded company seventeen undertakings were given by bae systems to the department of trade and industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the monopolies and mergers commission these were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender subcontracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries another condition was the firewalling of former british aerospace and mes teams on defence projects such as the joint strike fighter jsf in  the government on advice from the office of fair trading announced it had agreed to release bae systems from ten of the undertakings due to a change in circumstances bae systems inherited the uk government owned golden share that was established when british aerospace was privatised this unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the companys articles of association without the permission of the secretary of state these articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than  of the companys shares or control the majority of the board and that the ceo and the chairman of bae systems must be british nationals british aerospaces head office was in warwick house farnborough aerospace centre in farnborough hampshire bae systems retains this but the registered office and base for the senior leadership team is in the city of westminster sedit bae systems first annual report identified airbus support services to militaries and integrated systems for air land and naval applications as key areas of growth it also stated the companys desire to both expand in the us and participate in further consolidation in europe bae systems described  as an important year for its european joint ventures which were reorganised considerably the company has described the rationale for expansion in the us it is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the western european nations combined importantly us investment in research and development is significantly higher than in western europe when dick olver was appointed chairman in july  he ordered a review of the companys businesses which ruled out further european acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a strategic bias for expansion and investment in the us the review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and with two acquisitions in  and  bae moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world this shift in strategy was described as remarkable by the financial times between  and early  bae acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on traditional defence items such as warships and tanks in  matra marconi space a joint bae systemsmatra company was merged with the space division of dasa to form astrium on  june  bae sold its  share to eads for £ million however due to the lossmaking status of the company bae systems invested an equal amount for restructuring in january  airbus industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company bae systems sold its  majority share of bae systems canada an electronics company in april for ca approx £ million as of december  in november  the company announced the closure of the avro regional jet avro rj production line at woodford and the cancellation of the avro rjx an advanced series of the aircraft family as the business was no longer viable the final avro rj to be completed became the last british civil airliner in november  bae sold its  share of thomson marconi sonar to thales for £ million a further step of european defence consolidation was the merger of baes share of matra bae dynamics and the missile division of alenia marconi systems ams into mbda in december mbda thus became the worlds second largest missile manufacturer although eads has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of mbda bae has said that unlike airbus mbda is a core business the astuteclass submarine project caused bae to issue a profit warning in  and invest £ million to overcome its difficulties in june  bae systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with trw an american aerospace automotive and defence business this was prompted by northrop grummans £ billion approx us billion c  hostile bid for trw in february  a bidding war between bae systems northrop and general dynamics ended on  june when northrops increased bid of £ billion was accepted on  december  the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the nimrod mra maritime reconnaissanceattack aircraft and the astuteclass submarine projects on  february  bae took a charge of £ million against these projects and the ministry of defence mod agreed to pay a further £ million of the cost in  the company had taken a £ million loss charge on the nimrod contract which was expected to cover all the costs of completion of the current contract the uk government following a cabinet row described as one of the most bitter cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the westland helicopter affair in  ordered  bae hawk trainer aircraft with  options in july  in a deal worth £ million the deal was significant because it was a factor in indias decision to finalise a £ billion order for  hawks in march  also in july  bae systems and finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies to be collectively known as eurosystems these companies would have pooled the avionics cistar and communications businesses of the two companies however the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a reevaluation of the proposal bae systems  annual report states that recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed eurosystems transaction with finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model the main part of this deal was the dissolution of ams and the establishment of selex sensors and airborne systems bae systems sold its  share of the latter to finmeccanica for € million approx £ million c  in march  in may  it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions bae systems naval ships and bae systems submarines it was understood that general dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at barrowinfurness while vt group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the clyde however in  bae systems merged its surface fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of vt group to form bvt surface fleet an aim central to the british governments defence industrial strategy baes £ billion purchase of united defense in  added the mm bradley family of armoured vehicles to its product line on  june  bae systems outbid general dynamics for alvis vickers the uks main manufacturer of armoured vehicles alvis vickers was merged with the companys ro defence unit to form bae systems land systems recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to general dynamics bae systems executives soon identified the us defence company united defense industries udi a major competitor to general dynamics as a main acquisition target on  march  bae announced the £ billion approx us billion c  acquisition of udi udi now bae systems land and armaments manufactures combat vehicles artillery systems naval guns missile launchers and precision guided munitions in december  bae systems announced the sale of its german naval systems subsidiary atlas elektronik to thyssenkrupp and eads the sale was complicated by the requirement of the german government to approve any sale the financial times described the sale as cut price because french company thales bid € million but was blocked from purchasing atlas on national security grounds on  january  the company announced the sale of bae systems aerostructures to spirit aerosystems inc having said as early as  that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a core business on  august  saudi arabia signed a contract worth £ billion to £ billion for  eurofighter typhoons to be delivered by bae systems on  september  the company was awarded a £ billion contract for the upgrade of  royal saudi air force tornado idss one of bae systems major aims as highlighted in the  annual report was the granting of increased technology transfer between the uk and the us the f jsf programme became the focus of this effort with british government ministers such as lord drayson minister for defence procurement suggesting the uk would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the uk to operate and maintain fs independently however on  december  lord drayson signed an agreement which allows an unbroken british chain of command for operation of the aircraft on  december  bae received a £ million contract to provide guaranteed availability of royal air force raf tornados on  may  the company announced its subsidiary bae systems inc was to purchase armor holdings for £ billion approx us billion c  and completed the deal on  july  the company is a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies bae systems and british aerospace previously was a technology partner to the mclaren formula one team from  to december  the partnership originally focused on mclarens f cars aerodynamics eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques wireless systems and fuel management bae systems main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of mclaren the company announced the acquisition of tenix defence a major australian defence contractor on  january  the purchase was completed on  june for a million £ million making bae systems australia that countrys largest defence contractor the uk ministry of defence awarded bae systems a year munitions contract in august  worth up to £ billion and known as mass the contract guarantees supply of  of the uk armed forces ammunition and required bae to modernise its munitions manufacturing facilities bae systems expanded its intelligence and security business with the £ million purchase of detica group in july  it continued this strategy with purchases of danish cyber and intelligence company eti for approximately  million in december  and norkom group plc the following month for € million the latter provides counter fraud and antimoney laundering solutions to the global financial services industry where its software assists institutions to comply with regulations on financial intelligence and monitoring airbus shareholdingedit main article airbus bae systems inherited british aerospaces share of airbus industrie which consisted of two factories at broughton and filton these facilities manufactured wings for the airbus family of aircraft in  airbus was incorporated as airbus sas a joint stock company in return for a  share in the new company bae systems transferred ownership of its airbus plants known as airbus uk to the new company despite repeated suggestions as early as  that bae systems wished to sell its  share of airbus the possibility was consistently denied by the company however on  april  bbc news reported that it was indeed to sell its stake then conservatively valued at £ billion due to the slow pace of informal negotiations bae systems exercised its put option which saw investment bank rothschild appointed to give an independent valuation six days after this process began airbus announced delays to the a with significant effects on the value of airbus shares on  june  rothschild valued the companys share at £ billion well below its own analysts and even eads expectations the bae systems board recommended that the company proceed with the sale on  october  shareholders voted in favour and the sale was completed on  october bae systems sale of its airbus share saw the end of uk owned involvement in civil airliner production airbus operations ltd the former airbus uk continues to be the airbus centre

burden of risk to the contractor and were in contrast to cost plus contracts where a contractor was paid for the value of its product plus an agreed profit bae systems was operating in the only truly

american corporations boeing and mcdonnell douglas which followed the forming of lockheed martin the worlds largest defence contractor in  increased the pressure on european defence companies to consolidate in june  british aerospace defence managing director john weston commented europe is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the us european governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity a european aerospace and defence company as early as  british aerospace and the german aerospace and defence company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company the two companies envisaged including aérospatiale the other major european aerospace company but only after its privatisation the first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of airbus from a consortium of british aerospace dasa aérospatiale and construcciones aeronáuticas sa into an integrated company in this aim british aerospace and dasa were united against the various objections of aérospatiale as well as airbus british aerospace and dasa were partners in the panavia tornado and eurofighter typhoon aircraft projects merger discussions began between british aerospace and dasa in july  just as french participation became more likely with the announcement that aérospatiale was to merge with matra and emerge with a diluted french government shareholding a merger was agreed between british aerospace chairman richard evans and dasa ceo jürgen schrempp in december  meanwhile gec was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation reporting the appointment of george simpson as gec managing director in  the independent had said some analysts believe that mr simpsons inside knowledge of bae a longrumoured gec bid target was a key to his appointment gec favours forging a national champion defence group with bae to compete with the giant us organisations when gec put mes up for sale on  december  british aerospace abandoned the dasa merger in favour of purchasing its british rival the merger of british aerospace and mes was announced on  january  evans stated that in  that his fear was that an american defence contractor would acquire mes and challenge both british aerospace and dasa the merger created a vertically integrated company which the scotsman described as a combination of british aerospaces contracting and platformbuilding skills with marconis coveted electronics systems capability for example combining the manufacturer of the eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircrafts electronic systems british aerospace was mes largest customer in contrast dasas response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with aérospatiale to create the european aeronautic defence and space company eads a horizontal integration eads has since considered a merger with thales to create a fully rounded company seventeen undertakings were given by bae systems to the department of trade and industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the monopolies and mergers commission these were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender subcontracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries another condition was the firewalling of former british aerospace and mes teams on defence projects such as the joint strike fighter jsf in  the government on advice from the office of fair trading announced it had agreed to release bae systems from ten of the undertakings due to a change in circumstances bae systems inherited the uk government owned golden share that was established when british aerospace was privatised this unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the companys articles of association without the permission of the secretary of state these articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than  of the companys shares or control the majority of the board and that the ceo and the chairman of bae systems must be british nationals british aerospaces head office was in warwick house farnborough aerospace centre in farnborough hampshire bae systems retains this but the registered office and base for the senior leadership team is in the city of westminster sedit bae systems first annual report identified airbus support services to militaries and integrated systems for air land and naval applications as key areas of growth it also stated the companys desire to both expand in the us and participate in further consolidation in europe bae systems described  as an important year for its european joint ventures which were reorganised considerably the company has described the rationale for expansion in the us it is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the western european nations combined importantly us investment in research and development is significantly higher than in western europe when dick olver was appointed chairman in july  he ordered a review of the companys businesses which ruled out further european acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a strategic bias for expansion and investment in the us the review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and with two acquisitions in  and  bae moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world this shift in strategy was described as remarkable by the financial times between  and early  bae acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on traditional defence items such as warships and tanks in  matra marconi space a joint bae systemsmatra company was merged with the space division of dasa to form astrium on  june  bae sold its  share to eads for £ million however due to the lossmaking status of the company bae systems invested an equal amount for restructuring in january  airbus industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company bae systems sold its  majority share of bae systems canada an electronics company in april for ca approx £ million as of december  in november  the company announced the closure of the avro regional jet avro rj production line at woodford and the cancellation of the avro rjx an advanced series of the aircraft family as the business was no longer viable the final avro rj to be completed became the last british civil airliner in november  bae sold its  share of thomson marconi sonar to thales for £ million a further step of european defence consolidation was the merger of baes share of matra bae dynamics and the missile division of alenia marconi systems ams into mbda in december mbda thus became the worlds second largest missile manufacturer although eads has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of mbda bae has said that unlike airbus mbda is a core business the astuteclass submarine project caused bae to issue a profit warning in  and invest £ million to overcome its difficulties in june  bae systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with trw an american aerospace automotive and defence business this was prompted by northrop grummans £ billion approx us billion c  hostile bid for trw in february  a bidding war between bae systems northrop and general dynamics ended on  june when northrops increased bid of £ billion was accepted on  december  the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the nimrod mra maritime reconnaissanceattack aircraft and the astuteclass submarine projects on  february  bae took a charge of £ million against these projects and the ministry of defence mod agreed to pay a further £ million of the cost in  the company had taken a £ million loss charge on the nimrod contract which was expected to cover all the costs of completion of the current contract the uk government following a cabinet row described as one of the most bitter cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the westland helicopter affair in  ordered  bae hawk trainer aircraft with  options in july  in a deal worth £ million the deal was significant because it was a factor in indias decision to finalise a £ billion order for  hawks in march  also in july  bae systems and finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies to be collectively known as eurosystems these companies would have pooled the avionics cistar and communications businesses of the two companies however the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a reevaluation of the proposal bae systems  annual report states that recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed eurosystems transaction with finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model the main part of this deal was the dissolution of ams and the establishment of selex sensors and airborne systems bae systems sold its  share of the latter to finmeccanica for € million approx £ million c  in march  in may  it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions bae systems naval ships and bae systems submarines it was understood that general dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at barrowinfurness while vt group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the clyde however in  bae systems merged its surface fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of vt group to form bvt surface fleet an aim central to the british governments defence industrial strategy baes £ billion purchase of united defense in  added the mm bradley family of armoured vehicles to its product line on  june  bae systems outbid general dynamics for alvis vickers the uks main manufacturer of armoured vehicles alvis vickers was merged with the companys ro defence unit to form bae systems land systems recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to general dynamics bae systems executives soon identified the us defence company united defense industries udi a major competitor to general dynamics as a main acquisition target on  march  bae announced the £ billion approx us billion c  acquisition of udi udi now bae systems land and armaments manufactures combat vehicles artillery systems naval guns missile launchers and precision guided munitions in december  bae systems announced the sale of its german naval systems subsidiary atlas elektronik to thyssenkrupp and eads the sale was complicated by the requirement of the german government to approve any sale the financial times described the sale as cut price because french company thales bid € million but was blocked from purchasing atlas on national security grounds on  january  the company announced the sale of bae systems aerostructures to spirit aerosystems inc having said as early as  that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a core business on  august  saudi arabia signed a contract worth £ billion to £ billion for  eurofighter typhoons to be delivered by bae systems on  september  the company was awarded a £ billion contract for the upgrade of  royal saudi air force tornado idss one of bae systems major aims as highlighted in the  annual report was the granting of increased technology transfer between the uk and the us the f jsf programme became the focus of this effort with british government ministers such as lord drayson minister for defence procurement suggesting the uk would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the uk to operate and maintain fs independently however on  december  lord drayson signed an agreement which allows an unbroken british chain of command for operation of the aircraft on  december  bae received a £ million contract to provide guaranteed availability of royal air force raf tornados on  may  the company announced its subsidiary bae systems inc was to purchase armor holdings for £ billion approx us billion c  and completed the deal on  july  the company is a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies bae systems and british aerospace previously was a technology partner to the mclaren formula one team from  to december  the partnership originally focused on mclarens f cars aerodynamics eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques wireless systems and fuel management bae systems main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of mclaren the company announced the acquisition of tenix defence a major australian defence contractor on  january  the purchase was completed on  june for a million £ million making bae systems australia that countrys largest defence contractor the uk ministry of defence awarded bae systems a year munitions contract in august  worth up to £ billion and known as mass the contract guarantees supply of  of the uk armed forces ammunition and required bae to modernise its munitions manufacturing facilities bae systems expanded its intelligence and security business with the £ million purchase of detica group in july  it continued this strategy with purchases of danish cyber and intelligence company eti for approximately  million in december  and norkom group plc the following month for € million the latter provides counter fraud and antimoney laundering solutions to the global financial services industry where its software assists institutions to comply with regulations on financial intelligence and monitoring airbus shareholdingedit main article airbus bae systems inherited british aerospaces share of airbus industrie which consisted of two factories at broughton and filton these facilities manufactured wings for the airbus family of aircraft in  airbus

american corporations boeing and mcdonnell douglas which followed the forming of lockheed martin the worlds largest defence contractor in  increased the pressure on european defence companies to consolidate in june  british aerospace defence managing director john weston commented europe is supporting three times the number of contractors on less than half the budget of the us european governments wished to see the merger of their defence manufacturers into a single entity a european aerospace and defence company as early as  british aerospace and the german aerospace and defence company daimlerchrysler aerospace dasa were said to be keen to create a transnational aerospace and defence company the two companies envisaged including aérospatiale the other major european aerospace company but only after its privatisation the first stage of this integration was seen as the transformation of airbus from a consortium of british aerospace dasa aérospatiale and construcciones aeronáuticas sa into an integrated company in this aim british aerospace and dasa were united against the various objections of aérospatiale as well as airbus british aerospace and dasa were partners in the panavia tornado and eurofighter typhoon aircraft projects merger discussions began between british aerospace and dasa in july  just as french participation became more likely with the announcement that aérospatiale was to merge with matra and emerge with a diluted french government shareholding a merger was agreed between british aerospace chairman richard evans and dasa ceo jürgen schrempp in december  meanwhile gec was also under pressure to participate in defence industry consolidation reporting the appointment of george simpson as gec managing director in  the independent had said some analysts believe that mr simpsons inside knowledge of bae a longrumoured gec bid target was a key to his appointment gec favours forging a national champion defence group with bae to compete with the giant us organisations when gec put mes up for sale on  december  british aerospace abandoned the dasa merger in favour of purchasing its british rival the merger of british aerospace and mes was announced on  january  evans stated that in  that his fear was that an american defence contractor would acquire mes and challenge both british aerospace and dasa the merger created a vertically integrated company which the scotsman described as a combination of british aerospaces contracting and platformbuilding skills with marconis coveted electronics systems capability for example combining the manufacturer of the eurofighter with the company that provided many of the aircrafts electronic systems british aerospace was mes largest customer in contrast dasas response to the breakdown of the merger discussion was to merge with aérospatiale to create the european aeronautic defence and space company eads a horizontal integration eads has since considered a merger with thales to create a fully rounded company seventeen undertakings were given by bae systems to the department of trade and industry which prevented a reference of the merger to the monopolies and mergers commission these were largely to ensure that the integrated company would tender subcontracts to external companies on an equal basis with its subsidiaries another condition was the firewalling of former british aerospace and mes teams on defence projects such as the joint strike fighter jsf in  the government on advice from the office of fair trading announced it had agreed to release bae systems from ten of the undertakings due to a change in circumstances bae systems inherited the uk government owned golden share that was established when british aerospace was privatised this unique share prevents amendments of certain parts of the companys articles of association without the permission of the secretary of state these articles require that no foreign person or persons acting together may hold more than  of the companys shares or control the majority of the board and that the ceo and the chairman of bae systems must be british nationals british aerospaces head office was in warwick house farnborough aerospace centre in farnborough hampshire bae systems retains this but the registered office and base for the senior leadership team is in the city of westminster sedit bae systems first annual report identified airbus support services to militaries and integrated systems for air land and naval applications as key areas of growth it also stated the companys desire to both expand in the us and participate in further consolidation in europe bae systems described  as an important year for its european joint ventures which were reorganised considerably the company has described the rationale for expansion in the us it is by far the largest defence market with spend running close to twice that of the western european nations combined importantly us investment in research and development is significantly higher than in western europe when dick olver was appointed chairman in july  he ordered a review of the companys businesses which ruled out further european acquisitions or joint ventures and confirmed a strategic bias for expansion and investment in the us the review also confirmed the attractiveness of the land systems sector and with two acquisitions in  and  bae moved from a limited land systems supplier to the second largest such company in the world this shift in strategy was described as remarkable by the financial times between  and early  bae acquired five cyber security companies in a shift in strategy to take account of reduced spending by governments on traditional defence items such as warships and tanks in  matra marconi space a joint bae systemsmatra company was merged with the space division of dasa to form astrium on  june  bae sold its  share to eads for £ million however due to the lossmaking status of the company bae systems invested an equal amount for restructuring in january  airbus industrie was transformed from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company bae systems sold its  majority share of bae systems canada an electronics company in april for ca approx £ million as of december  in november  the company announced the closure of the avro regional jet avro rj production line at woodford and the cancellation of the avro rjx an advanced series of the aircraft family as the business was no longer viable the final avro rj to be completed became the last british civil airliner in november  bae sold its  share of thomson marconi sonar to thales for £ million a further step of european defence consolidation was the merger of baes share of matra bae dynamics and the missile division of alenia marconi systems ams into mbda in december mbda thus became the worlds second largest missile manufacturer although eads has been reported to be interested in acquiring full control of mbda bae has said that unlike airbus mbda is a core business the astuteclass submarine project caused bae to issue a profit warning in  and invest £ million to overcome its difficulties in june  bae systems confirmed it was in takeover discussions with trw an american aerospace automotive and defence business this was prompted by northrop grummans £ billion approx us billion c  hostile bid for trw in february  a bidding war between bae systems northrop and general dynamics ended on  june when northrops increased bid of £ billion was accepted on  december  the company issued a shock profit warning due to cost overruns of the nimrod mra maritime reconnaissanceattack aircraft and the astuteclass submarine projects on  february  bae took a charge of £ million against these projects and the ministry of defence mod agreed to pay a further £ million of the cost in  the company had taken a £ million loss charge on the nimrod contract which was expected to cover all the costs of completion of the current contract the uk government following a cabinet row described as one of the most bitter cabinet disputes over defence contracts since the westland helicopter affair in  ordered  bae hawk trainer aircraft with  options in july  in a deal worth £ million the deal was significant because it was a factor in indias decision to finalise a £ billion order for  hawks in march  also in july  bae systems and finmeccanica announced their intention to set up three joint venture companies to be collectively known as eurosystems these companies would have pooled the avionics cistar and communications businesses of the two companies however the difficulties of integrating the companies in this way led to a reevaluation of the proposal bae systems  annual report states that recognising the complexity of the earlier proposed eurosystems transaction with finmeccanica we have moved to a simpler model the main part of this deal was the dissolution of ams and the establishment of selex sensors and airborne systems bae systems sold its  share of the latter to finmeccanica for € million approx £ million c  in march  in may  it was reported that the company was considering selling its shipbuilding divisions bae systems naval ships and bae systems submarines it was understood that general dynamics wished to acquire the submarine building facilities at barrowinfurness while vt group was said to be interested in the remaining yards on the clyde however in  bae systems merged its surface fleet arm with the shipbuilding operations of vt group to form bvt surface fleet an aim central to the british governments defence industrial strategy baes £ billion purchase of united defense in  added the mm bradley family of armoured vehicles to its product line on  june  bae systems outbid general dynamics for alvis vickers the uks main manufacturer of armoured vehicles alvis vickers was merged with the companys ro defence unit to form bae systems land systems recognising the lack of scale of this business compared to general dynamics bae systems executives soon identified the us defence company united defense industries udi a major competitor to general dynamics as a main acquisition target on  march  bae announced the £ billion approx us billion c  acquisition of udi udi now bae systems land and armaments manufactures combat vehicles artillery systems naval guns missile launchers and precision guided munitions in december  bae systems announced the sale of its german naval systems subsidiary atlas elektronik to thyssenkrupp and eads the sale was complicated by the requirement of the german government to approve any sale the financial times described the sale as cut price because french company thales bid € million but was blocked from purchasing atlas on national security grounds on  january  the company announced the sale of bae systems aerostructures to spirit aerosystems inc having said as early as  that it wished to dispose of what it did not regard as a core business on  august  saudi arabia signed a contract worth £ billion to £ billion for  eurofighter typhoons to be delivered by bae systems on  september  the company was awarded a £ billion contract for the upgrade of  royal saudi air force tornado idss one of bae systems major aims as highlighted in the  annual report was the granting of increased technology transfer between the uk and the us the f jsf programme became the focus of this effort with british government ministers such as lord drayson minister for defence procurement suggesting the uk would withdraw from the project without the transfer of technology that would allow the uk to operate and maintain fs independently however on  december  lord drayson signed an agreement which allows an unbroken british chain of command for operation of the aircraft on  december  bae received a £ million contract to provide guaranteed availability of royal air force raf tornados on  may  the company announced its subsidiary bae systems inc was to purchase armor holdings for £ billion approx us billion c  and completed the deal on  july  the company is a manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies bae systems and british aerospace previously was a technology partner to the mclaren formula one team from  to december  the partnership originally focused on mclarens f cars aerodynamics eventually moving on to carbon fibre techniques wireless systems and fuel management bae systems main interest in the partnership was to learn about the high speed build and operations processes of mclaren the company announced the acquisition of tenix defence a major
