time prior to or after the substitution in accordance with the terms of the contract finally the substitution should in no way affect whatever tax benefits contract owners currently enjoy and will not engender any adverse tax consequences applicants legal analysis  section b of the  act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substitution of the securities held by the trust the section further provides that the commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the  act  applicants assert that the proposed substitution meets the standards that the commission has applied to past substitutions  applicants assert that the investment objectives and policies of vp advantage and vp balanced are sufficiently comparable that the investment strategies currently employed by contract owners may be maintained after the substitution both funds seek to provide investors with the benefits of a balanced portfolio of fixed income and equity securities that serves as a more conservative alternative to traditional growth funds and as a more aggressive alternative to traditional bond funds  applicants further assert that contract owners will benefit from the proposed substitution because vp balanced has greater assets than vp advantage accordingly vp balanced should continue to have lower expenses as a percentage of net asset than does vp advantage creating the opportunity for better performance conclusion applicants assert for the reasons stated above that the proposed substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act and the requested order approving the substitution should be granted start signature for the
