affirms cnh equipment trust b july    am eastern daylight time chicagobusiness wirefitch ratings affirms all classes of cnh equipment trust b at their current ratings a full list of rating actions follows at the end of this ratings action commentary key rating drivers the affirmations of the class a notes reflect loss coverage levels consistent with the current ratings as of the june  reporting period cumulative net losses totaled  basis points and as such the transaction is extrapolating below fitchs initial base case loss proxy the stable outlook for all classes reflects fitchs expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the transaction amortizes rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxy which would impact available loss coverage lower loss coverage could impact ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transaction the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to x and x higher of fitchs base case loss expectation initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the new issue report published june   to date the transaction has exhibited strong performance with losses within fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels as such continued strong performance for the transaction would most likely result in continued stable ratings conversely a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pool to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings due diligence usage no third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation
