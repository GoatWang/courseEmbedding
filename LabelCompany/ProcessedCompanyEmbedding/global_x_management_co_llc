explanation download chart data csv how can the fund trade at a premiumdiscount to its nav the primary explanation is that timing discrepancies can arise between the nav and the closing price of the fund since shares of the fund trade on the open market prices are affected by the constant flow of information received by investors corporations and financial institutions depending on how this changing information affects investor sentiment shares of the fund may deviate slightly from the value of the funds underlying assets as a result shareholders may pay more than nav when they buy fund shares and receive less than nav when they sell those shares because shares are purchased and sold at current market prices however due to the creation and redemption process that is unique to etfs market makers are able to minimize these deviations from nav by taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities what causes these time discrepancies close of trading times although both the nav and the closing trade of the fund are generally calculated at the closing time of  pm eastern time slight differences in this timing may cause discrepancies time of last trade trading of global x funds generally takes place during normal trading hours  am to  pm eastern time however it is important to note that the last trade  from which the closing price is determined  may not occur at exactly  pm eastern time therefore changing market sentiment during the time difference may cause the nav to deviate from the closing price international holdings the premiums and discounts for funds with significant holdings in international markets may be less accurate due to the different closing times of various international markets because the funds trade during us market hours while the
