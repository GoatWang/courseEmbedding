interview terry davenport starbucks cmo mcds java push will work in our favor davenport says chain will draw customers via mccafe education by emily bryson york published on june   chicago adagecom  starbucks chief marketer terry davenport has a big job these days the embattled coffee chain is looking for ways to offer value without discounts that would degrade the brand and market without pandering all while fighting off the onslaught that is mcdonalds mccafe mr davenport a former kfc marketer joined starbucks in  several promotions culminated in his scoring the cmo spot about a year ago since then he points to a few recent successes including solid sales of the companys loyalty cards a strong response to its getoutthevote offer and encouraging results for via instant coffee starbucks cmo terry davenport but many hurdles lie ahead the chain has been posting negative samestore sales for over a year and many analysts expect mcdonalds initial mccafe push which began last month to significantly dent starbucks sales if only initially in the most recent quarter starbucks reported samestore sales down  and earnings down  primarily due to restructuring charges still thanks to a strong yearold relationship with its agency bbdo new york starbucks is more visible than ever while keeping marketing spending relatively constant according to tns media intelligence starbucks spent about  million in measured media during  it began its first concerted branding campaign last month with a series of newspaper ads the work makes starbucks case for its prices including health care for its employees relationships with coffee farmers and its dedication to sustainability starbucks also now runs onetime tv ads in highprofile shows such as saturday night live or quick hits on news networks such as cnn which then drive traffic online the marketer made more waves this week with the sponsorship of msnbc morning news program morning joe a natural partnership mr davenport said it will include occasional references to the chains environmental activism or efforts in volunteerism mr davenport  reports to michelle gas exec vpmarketing and category and also works closely with ceo howard schultz a man he describes as one of the most respected marketing minds in the business and someone who rolls up his sleeves and gets involved in messaging in an interview with ad age mr davenport explained why mccafe will be good for starbucks because the golden arches are paying to educate the mass market in a way starbucks has never been able to ad age starbucks is facing attacks on a variety of fronts from fastfood companies with enormous ad budgets to superpremium local and regional coffee chains that are quicker and nimbler what about that is most troubling mr davenport the obvious brandguy answer is that we absolutely will not allow ourselves to be squeezed into the middle of those two groups on the mass side we know from research over the years that there are still a lot of people who drink coffee every day but dont understand the difference between a cappuccino a mocha and a latte but we never had hundreds of millions of dollars to do that education the fact that there are people spending money and having that conversation we think it will benefit the entire category and well get our fair share if people get into the category get comfortable and want to trade up to a premium higherquality version were in a great position to capture some of those ad age how has your strategy changed during the recession mr davenport early on we got to a point of view that this is not just some temporary speed bump we have to manage through but a seismic shift that has happened in consumer consciousness and consumer spending habits arent just going to return to what they once were and as to how starbucks and your starbucks occasion stays relevant to that consumer mindset there are two things the emotional part to our brand thats bigger than just that cup of coffee  its an emotional connection  and now more than ever its that sense of community something in life can connect you to something larger ad age how are you measuring roi these days mr davenport were probably more focused than ever on storelevel transactions and the number of people who walk into every store every day probably more than ever were focused on what it takes to bring people into our stores and keep their frequency at a time when theyre having to make some tough budgeting choices ad age are you involved with pricing decisions mr davenport pricing decisions are very much a part of the marketing mix were aware that now more than ever pricing cant be a blunt instrument and as you look at pricing its got to be in the consumer construct youll probably continue to see us do instore tests of a lot of ways to bring value to core customers ad age starbucks began its first true branding campaign last month why did you choose newspapers mr davenport we started working with bbdo in october or november of last year and one of the things on our joint todo list was to find a way to get our stories out there in a way that both our existing customers would recognize and that would speak to the employees and partners and give them a sense of pride and thats clearly happened were exceedingly pleased with it to date if youre going to look at a quick roi and if one of the ways you gauge that is the visibility and kind of talk its getting  weve had a huge return on that investment ad age you managed to launch a major campaign just days before mcdonalds mccafé blitz began was that planned mr davenport we didnt move it up or back based on anybody elses schedule its about coffee and launching in the middle of the summer wouldnt have been the right time before the weather turned hot we feel like we got it out there in the right time and we felt really comfortable with it ad age how do online communities and the energy around the starbucks brand affect your media and marketing plans mr davenport starbucks is not just a product it is an idea the idea is that sense of community and conversation that can happen over a great cup of coffee thats why our brand has such relevance in that space customers and employees are looking for the truth behind what their company stands for and want to get behind brands that share certain values when we go out and have good traction with facebook its because of those types of messages ad age can you give an example mr davenport take how we communicate our valuepairing message its very important to our value strategy its been very successful at the store level but thats why we communicate that at the store level a tiein with facebook on value pairings isnt something youre necessarily going to run out and share with your friends but learning that starbucks has a tiein with red and that on world aids day well contribute a nickel for every beverage we sell  for people in the red community thats big news and theyll pass it on to their friends ad age hows it going with the new agency mr davenport we work exceedingly closely with bbdo and in a very short time feel like were all part of one team and that includes howard howard and michelle are very involved with formation of strategy down to getting our voice correct and in this day and age you need an agency thats willing to roll up their sleeves and get involved with you and learn about your brand and bring creative solutions that are brandappropriate in this article cmo interviews most popular become a member register now renew membership
