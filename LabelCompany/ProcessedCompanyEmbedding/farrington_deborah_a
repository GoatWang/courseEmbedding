need feedback corner office by adam bryant may   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview with deborah farrington a founder and general partner at starvest partners a venture capital firm in new york was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq what were some important leadership lessons you’ve learneda i found early on as a manager that it was hard to learn how to delegate i think that most people in their early leadership positions either tend to delegate too little or too much and i delegated too little at first i felt i needed to know everything that was going on so i ended up doing a lot of the work myself that the people who reported to me should have been doing i found myself working  hours a day seven days a week i stepped back and said “this is not going to work”so i sat down and talked to the people who worked for me and we agreed on various goals but then i delegated too much when they came back at the end of the quarter and i saw what they did i realized that approach didn’t work well either so i learned the importance of weekly checkins and then i think i got the balance rightq what elsea i had a terrific boss at merrill lynch who taught me that the most important conversation you can have with anybody who works for you is the performance review because people especially those who are goaloriented and very highachieving want feedback they need that and my boss made me feel that nothing was more important than this conversation when you’re young you know you can improve you want to improve you need feedback and you need constructive feedback advertisement continue reading the main story so when i coach and rate ceo’s today — if i’m on a board if i’m hiring them or giving them feedback — i’m always looking to see if they understood what they’ve done well do they understand what they didn’t do well are they listening to my feedback can they accept it how do they then modify their behavior continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story q when you started your own firm you had a blank slate to create the culture you wanted what did you do a there were four of us who started the business together — three women and one man — and we had each worked at firms that we felt had been too aggressive too cutthroat we came from investment banks from private equity from other venture firms where people were always vying to say “i did this and therefore i want the biggest reward”we wanted to start a firm that was based on respect for the individual with a moral culture so we started out with a rule “no jerks allowed ever” the language was a little more blunt but you get the idea we’d all worked with too many people like that photo in evaluating chief executives deborah a farrington says she watches for their ability to understand what they are and aren’t doing well credit earl wilsonthe new york times and we wanted a culture where accomplishments and results were valued above politics each person would have time to be heard and each person would be required to be heard you had to have an opinion you couldn’t just say “well i’m going to pass on that”another thing we did was to bring in a leadership consultant not long after we started the business in  to run offsite meetings for the four founders once or twice a year he helped us understand our individual styles and how we liked to make decisions and interact one person went a b c d — very linear another person quickly processed things immediately went from a to z and said “this is it” and other people had something in between so it really helped us understand the decisionmaking style of the partners and that helped us develop some of the ground rules for how we make decisionsso we really focused on communication and clarity one of our rules is that everybody gets a chance to speak and they have three minutes each then we would discuss and then we would vote we really focused on

subscribed to this email view all new york times newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime q when you’re working with ceo’s of the companies you’re investing in do you find yourself repeating certain things a what i tend to say to them is “talk to me about what you’re doing right and how you’re doing it and what you feel you can do better” i don’t want to hear only good news because with a growing company and especially for firsttime ceo’s i think they feel that they need to know all the answers — “i can’t show weakness i can’t show that i don’t know how to do something” advertisement continue reading the main story so they tend to want to come to you with answers and the problems solved and i say “no that’s not what i want tell me what the problems are so i can help you solve them this stuff is tough we don’t expect you to do everything yourself let me help you let the board help you”i look for people who don’t think they know all the answers because no one does in this very fastchanging world especially in technology i want to know if they’re going to listen when i’m giving them feedback because i’ve seen a lot i’ve invested in about  companies and i’ve looked at hundreds of others i tell them i’m not preaching to you i’m partnering with you i’m not your boss i’m a board member and i’m trying to make you be the best ceo you can be q tell me more about how you assess chief executives a obviously you want expertise technical skills and you want them to be really smart but i’m also looking for more subjective things like selfawareness do they understand their own strengths and weaknesses can they create excitement for others and the desire to achievei would say that in  percent of the companies we’ve invested in the board has decided to change the ceo so when you are hiring a new ceo of course you want to know if they know what to do and how to do it what i always ask them is “review your career for me tell me what you did and why you did it” i want to understand that person’s history and in describing their professional history their personal history comes out when they explain why they changed jobsif they’re a firsttime ceo can they learn do they have the attributes that’ll make a great ceo can they hire “a” players can they build a sense of mission and urgency can they maintain

of starvest partners by melissa j anderson new york city deborah farrington cofounder and general partner of starvest partners said one of her key career themes has been an ability to take risks at the appropriate time and seize opportunities as they presented themselves she encouraged women to be more open to taking on new challenges when they arise – to walk through doorways when they are opened “don’t shy away from things i think you’ll be surprised at how well you can do them” she said farrington is now a leading venture capitalist and as one of only two women named on the forbes midas list of top tech investors this year she is enthusiastic about getting more women into the field taking on new opportunities farrington began her career in chase manhattan’s global credit training program with her first job at chase lending to small businesses “it was very good preparation for venture because small business is all about managing cash flow to survive” she explained next she pursued an mba at harvard business school and after graduating took a job at merrill lynch in investment banking when her husband who worked for salomon brothers was transferred to hong kong merrill lynch was able to find a role for her in hong kong as well “i was covering emerging markets in the ‘s which was all about high growth” she said then when they moved to tokyo she took a job as a securities analyst “in japan at the time they didn’t really know what to do with a female investment banker” she explained so when merrill asked “how about being a securities analyst” she responded “i can do that” she recalled “it was the beginning of the asian growth miracle and i joined a hong kong merchant bank called asia oceanic group in the late ‘s our mandate was facilitating the flow of capital and technology between asia and the us that was my first exposure to private equity and to being  a principal instead of an agent and i loved it i headed corporate finance in new york and then hong kong our firm started coinvesting alongside our clients in tech companies which were just beginning to outsource to china from headquarters  in hong kong at the time” when she came back to new york farrington ran a small public company controlled by asian oceanic “i said i’d never done that before but i’d certainly give it a try” she said with a laugh “i then approached a group of friends from harvard business school about backing me to buy the public company i had been running they declined but invited me to join them and we started a multistrategy private equityventure group we had a thesis about business services going on the web and made an investment and it did extremely well” this was the first investment at what became victory ventures where she was ceo and she noted the group eventually did end up buying the public company she had been running after four years she decided that the time was right to start her own fund to invest in internetbased business services and joined with three other partners in  to start starvest which invests in software as a service ecommerce and internet marketing technologies she said “venture capital is by far the most interesting thing i’ve ever done every day part of my job is to think about what’s the next big thing in technology and a key part of the job of a venture capitalist is  to help guide and grow our companies and work with ceos mentoring them and providing resources the primary responsibility of a venture capitalist is to successfully exit our companies to send money back to our limited partner investors this requires judgments about economic trends and opportunities for liquidity in the public ipo market and through mergers and acquisitions being an investment banker was good training for this ” finally she added because the majority of starvest’s investors are state and city pension funds “we have an important fiduciary duty to provide investment returns to fund their pension obligations” getting more women into venture according to a recent survey by the national venture capital association nvca and dow jones venturesource only about  percent of the industry is female according to farrington increasing the percentage of women in the field would yield important benefits first of all she said “you always have to think about who your customers are with ecommerce and social media increasing steadily in importance as venture investments at least half of your customers are going to be women that alone is a reason for having more women go into venture” “second in my experience women have a better ability to come to collective decisions men are more frequently confrontational while women tend to be better collaborators one of the things i always find important to making good decisions is bringing together a lot of different views and focusing on the best of those without pride of authorship women are particularly good at that especially at the board level” “i’m often the only woman on a board and i find myself asking the question where are we now and how can i edit and synthesize that in order to move forward’” she added and third she continued “getting as many views as possible into a room is important particularly in venture it’s very important to have people who will look at things in a different way than the prevailing wisdom” where are the women then she answered “this is something i have thought a lot about i look at it in the historical context of finance waves of women went into different areas at different times first it was commercial banking in the early ‘s then investment banking in the ‘s then private equity in the ‘s as these areas expanded and became more mainstream women turned to the opportunities as they became available but there are always special challenges for the pioneers” she continued “venture came to the forefront in the late ‘s and early s with some of the huge wins like ebay intuit salesforcecom and such which tend to be technology oriented but fewer women have a background in technology and engineering – and this is one challenge” “i have marveled at the opportunities afforded by each of the fields i’ve worked in but especially venture there’s so much going on right now there’s so much value creation possible and i think this area is best able to be an engine for job creation by backing entrepreneurs which is a particular challenge in our economy and now and very important for our society in starvest’s portfolio the companies we’ve backed have created thousands of jobs i want to make sure women are more aware of and can take advantage of and participate in these opportunities” she continued “as women it’s important that we guide our own destinies gain financial independence and contribute to and have a real voice in society and the economy i think by having women more  involved in  more parts of the economy it will create a better society by enabling all the best minds to be involved” overcoming challenges farrington said that one of the main barriers for women in getting into the field is just that they don’t “venture has not done a particularly good job with outreach i do think there are other ways for people to get involved in venture for example my background in finance gave me expertise in analyzing business models” besides an awareness issue she said women can develop the expertise necessary for getting into venture by going into related fields that provide training such as an investment banking analyst or developing expertise in the area of venture they’d like to participate in such as ecommerce technology product management or digital media and she said she wants the industry to realize the value that women bring to the venture conversation “the field needs to recognize that women are additive to the firm and in the boardroom i believe the dialogue in the boardroom is richer and better when women are involved” she continued “the excellent returns generated from investing in social and digital media and ecommerce where women are more concentrated should do a lot to open the eyes of the men  at vc firms” farrington cited companies like gilt and birchbox which were founded by women “you want someone analyzing them from the customer’s ie woman’s eyes” “there are more women ceos and there need to be more women vcs too it’s time to recognize that women are much more involved in some of the areas that these firms are making most of their money in” she added in her personal time in her nonstarvest time farrington follows her two passions women’s education and women’s economic empowerment “most of my philanthropic activities revolve around these” she is a board member of opportunity international a leading international microfinance institution that makes loans primarily to women and traveled to uganda in each of the last two summers for them with her  year old nephew as well as to nicaragua she is on the investment committee of her alma mater smith college and is a member of the dean’s visiting committee at harvard business school where she recently endowed a fellowship for women entrepreneurs farrington also loves sports with her favorites being running and yoga at least three times a week as well as skiing which she has done all her life but most important of all to her is her family she asked “what would life be
