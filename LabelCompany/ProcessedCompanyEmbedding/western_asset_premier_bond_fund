market is undergoing a series of profound changes challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities we believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixedincome landscape interest rates may challenge investors opportunities exist across the globe across the spectrum divergence in global growth lower liquidity may mean higher volatility can your portfolio keep up we believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns  overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their longterm investments not individual bonds and money market funds for their shortterm investments explore

returns around a particular average level this fund is new and has limited operating history you cannot invest directly in an index investors should carefully consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund before investing to obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information please call wise  or visit wisdomtreecom investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing there are risks associated with investing including possible loss of principal unlike typical exchangetraded funds there is no index that the fund attempts to track or replicate thus the ability of the fund to achieve its objective will depend on the effectiveness of the portfolio manager fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk their value will normally decline as interest rates rise in addition when interest rates fall income may decline fixed income investments are also subject to credit risk the risk that the issuer of a bond will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline highyield or junk bonds have lower credit ratings and involve a greater risk to principal foreign investing involves special risks such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty investments in emerging offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments derivative investments can be volatile and these investments may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effects of varied economic conditions the fund may engage in short sale transactions where losses may be exaggerated potentially losing more money than the actual cost of the investment and the third party to the short sale may fail to honor its contract terms causing a loss to the fund please read the funds prospectus for specific details regarding the fund’s risk profile wisdomtree funds are distributed by
