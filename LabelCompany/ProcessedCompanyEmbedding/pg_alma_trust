trustmap include jabber jive team podio chatter ms sharepoint and microsoft yammera complete list of collaboration tools is available herecollaboration tools overviewwhat is collaboration softwarecollaboration software is designed to make working together on professional projectsespecially bottleneck processes like getting feedback and giving approvaleasier and faster the three core areas of functionality for collaborative tools are communication project  task management and file sharing  management some products stress one feature set over another these take a bestofbreed approach and often work well if they are highly integratable slack for example is an online team collaboration app that provides messaging and file sharing and integrates for everything else collaboration tools are closely related to a number of other types of software including business communications eg email community platforms enterprise social document storage and project management software many of these platforms include builtin collaboration features some collaboration tools can replace these more traditional solutions however it is more common for pureplay collaboration tools to be integrated with a companys existing communication and workflow infrastructure online collaboration toolsalthough locally hosted collaboration solutions like redbooth private cloud are available online collaboration tools are more abundant and are often more convenient especially for disparate teams or team members who work remotely online collaboration tools are saas or cloud solutions that allow eprofessionals to work together on common tasks they come in many forms from mobile apps to browser extensions some are industry and use casespecific for instance online collaboration tools like murally and conceptboard are optimized for brainstorming sessions among graphic designers others like microsoft yammer are designed to be more like a social network for corporate enterprises there are numerous other formats for collaboration as well such as confluences internal knowledge base mindmeisters flowchart mindmaps and trellos simple todo card system there are many basic free online collaboration options such as govisually trello and podio and many paid solutions have free trials or freemium versions available adoptionadoption is key to success with collaboration software it will only be effective if everyone involved with the project is on board so it is important to choose a collaboration tool thats easy to use and that fits with your teams project culture but there are a ton of collaboration products on the market right now and its a growing space here are some considerations to help you drill down and find a good fit for your use case what types of projects will you collaborate onwhat are the steps of a typical projecthow do people on your team currently handle communication and workflowwhere do they store project fileshow many people will be collaborating in how many departmentswill project managers or the people doing the project be collaborating or bothsince integration is so important what other platforms and apps does your team usecollaboration features  capabilitiescommunicationsome tools like skype google hangouts and hipchat have communication capabilities at their core other collaboration features are available as well but their scale number of collaborators for example may be limited or dependent on the level of the subscription communication features common across collaboration tools include options for integrated messaging such as a live chat comments within a file and private or group messagesprivacy  access settingsconference callingvideo chats with screensharingprojectbased conversationsproject  task managementmany online collaboration tools have basic project  task management capabilities but these are not usually as advanced as the capabilities available from traditional project management vendors asana microsoft yammer basecamp trello and huddle are other collaboration tools noted for significant project  task management features some of these products skirt the line between collaboration and project management for example wrike has very robust project management capabilities but its design aims to emulate the ease and engagement of a social networka quality common among collaboration tools project  task management capabilities are often more important to larger teams teams working between departments or teams within larger organizations where there are more dependencies and levels of approval collaboration features related to project  task management can includeworkflow automationtracking the location of a file as well as who has opened or changed it and whenbrainstorming toolspinboardstask lists and assignments with due dates subtasks and file attachment capabilitiesscheduling with calendar integration and automated reminders and alertsgantt chartsfile sharing

environment to grow overall markets and increase its market share the company needs to invest in improved product formulations packaging sales coverage advertising sampling upstream rd and consumer and customer value a significant portion of the abovenoted investments will be funded by the company’s billions of identified cost saving opportunities across the organization investors should buy the company’s shares at a valueoriented price for income and to benefit from its incisive and likely effective efforts to drive revenueearnings growth in recent years procter  gamble nysepg has been in the midst of a transformation to drive revenue growth in a depressed global environment while also addressing the adverse effects of a strong us dollar while we believe that part of pgs struggles related to its large size and the law of large numbers we also believe that the company had very real problems that needed to be addressed earlier in  according to pg multiple factors contributed to decelerating sales growth including delayed tax returns higher gas prices bad weather and a likely drawdown of athome inventory while the company has acknowledged that it has been facing an unprecedented amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty it has emphasized that it is aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate the impacts of such multiple adversities pg is also protecting its investments in its businesses to maintain and accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable market constructive and value accretive way the company has also noted that in the near term the external challenges it faces including slow market growth geopoliticaleconomic instability the strong us dollar increasing commodity costs and retail trade transformation will continue despite the abovenoted challenges pg is in the midst of several strategic objectives that include  enhancing product and package superiority  emphasizing excellence of execution  focusing on cost and cash productivity and  ensuring organizational design culture and accountability the company sees such strategic efforts as necessary in a slow growth environment to grow markets and market share to achieve positive outcomes category growth increased household penetration strong share positions and sales and profit growth in this difficult environment the company understands that it must combine a foundation of irresistibly superior product and packaging experiences with superior execution in advertising sampling and instore fundamentals with winning value equations to accomplish such higher standards more consistently the company acknowledges it will need to invest in improved product formulations packaging sales coverage advertising sampling upstream research and development and consumer and customer value a significant portion of such investments will be funded by pgs billions of identified cost saving opportunities across the organization while the company has made progress to date with respect to such strategic efforts it knows its efforts must continue earlier in june  pg participated in the deutsche bank global consumer conference and made a presentation in regard to its innovation marketing and transformational efforts to drive more substantive and consistent revenueearnings growth in such presentation pg highlighted the significant changes to the company it had made to create shareholder value more specifically the company noted that it has become a simpler and more focused organization by  narrowing its product portfolio to focus on its most profitable core brands and  driving productivity through operational efficiencies in about two years pg divested discontinued or consolidated  brands which represented about  percent of fiscal  sales and only about  percent of profit with such divestitures the company has a  productcategory portfolio with more historical revenueprofit growth than the old pg with respect to the product categories the company has retained each category has a leading market position and is used daily where purchase intent and choice are driven more by a specific job to do and product effectiveness in doing such job a decade earlier about a third of pgs sales were in categories where purchase decisions were primarily driven by fashion flavor or fragrance today almost no company category is driven by fashion flavor or fragrance pgs retained product categories leverage its core strengths consumer understanding branding product and packaging innovation and its gotomarket capabilities beyond the companys product portfolio rationalization it has also made significant productivity improvements to maximize the value of its future growth over the prior five years pg achieved its target to save  billion to achieve such cost savings the company significantly reduced its productbrand categories but also reduced its number of manufacturing sites mainly in developed markets and moved more of the work closer to consumers and faster growing developing markets the company  simplified manufacturing platforms  decreased manufacturing enrolment  reduced its number of advertising public relations and other agencies supporting the business  reduced nonworking media costs and  decreased the number of its office buildings and research and development centers pg net of reinvestments into innovation sales coverage media and sampling productivity savings has been able to deliver constant currency growth and operating profit margin improvement in high single digits to doubledigit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years pg understands that it needs to accelerate revenue growth as it continues to improve its margins the company understands further that to be a consumer products leader in total shareholder returns they must have balanced revenue growth margin growth and high cash efficiency balance growth and value creation according to pg there are three areas of value creating that include  product superiority such as impactful meaningful advantages that earn trial and repurchase grow markets and build share  productivity such as bestinclass core structures by category to fuel growth and value creation and  organization culture and accountability that includes personnel that are experienced agile accountable to deliver and sustain exceptional performance the company is establishing a higher standard of excellence for itself for products and packages communication execution in stores and online and consumer and customer value delivering on such higher standards is what it needs in the current slow growth environment to grow markets and market share and to prevent commoditization of its categories and minimize deflationary impacts such standards are also needed to decrease promotional spending and create strong retail relevance across channels offline and online pg understands that its new higher standards represent its need to deliver products that have a significant enough advantage to change consumers affinity for its brands and their expectations of a product category for example superior products are ideally delivered in superior packages superior packaging attracts the consumer provides integrity and quality protection and delights consumers during use superior packaging creates recognizable brands on shelves aides the consumer in selecting the best product for their needs conveys the equity of a brand and closes the sale superior products and superior packages drive market growth and prevent commoditization with improved product and packaging pg needs to advertise to communicate such benefits as such the company is setting a higher standard of excellence on advertising quality with a focus on brand performance claims that communicates a brands benefits instore execution is another area where pg is setting a higher standard growing product categories and its brands for example the company requires the right trade coverage right product forms sizes and price points and the right instore shelving and merchandising execution to deliver against key business drivers for each product category in every store across all channels pg knows that when it executes the above strategies correctly product category growth accelerates overall growth accelerates and it is able to deliver tradespending efficiencies that enable it to reinvest and improve store coverage in additional stores in addition the company recognizes that its online shopping experience also demands excellence in execution for example strong online execution includes video strong performance claims and strong value offerings so that consumers search for and purchase pg products pgs ecommerce sales are increasing  percent in the current fiscal year significantly outpacing offline sales the companys ecommerce sales are  billion larger than its top three competitors combined as such the company is committed to winning in such fastgrowing selling channel with this said the companys last element of superior execution is winning consumer and customer value equations price is one element of a winning consumer value equation but pg is looking at the superior value of the total proposition of products that meets consumer needs in a noticeable and superior way with packages that are convenient to use with compelling communication to fund pgs investments in the above initiatives the company continues to improve upon on productivity given the needs for such investments pg has plans to save up to another  billion from the current fiscal year through fiscal  the company has identified  billion of additional cost of goods savings which comes on top of the  billion of cost of goods savings it achieved over the previous five years the largest opportunity within such new goal is about  billion is raw and packaging materials such savings will come from strategic prior partnerships supplier consolidation and through a simplification of its product lineup and manufacturing platforms for example the company has innovated with respect to lowercost packaging and new packaging for the ecommerce channel the company is aiming for about  billion of savings and manufacturing expense pg is also digitizing its manufacturing operations and automating with robotics the company also sees an opportunity for an additional  billion of savings from transportation warehousing and other costs of goods sold further the company sees over  billion of savings in marketing spending the company is also estimating it can achieve another  billion to  billion of additional overhead cost reduction in total pg has identified  billion to  billion of cost savings but has riskadjusted such amount down to  billion to account for uncertainty that exists with the majority of pgs transformational efforts behind it and we believe that the company will benefit from more focused brand spending and therefore an improved ability to more effectively recognize and respond to changing consumer trends while pg will continue to face competition along many of its product lines from branded and privatelabel products the company supports its multiple billiondollar iconic brands with its expertise of innovation marketing and promotion to fend off and stand up to such competition in addition the companys research and development capabilities enable it to launch new products and to extend product lines so as to adapt to changing consumer tastes while we recognize the adversities that pg faces we also recognize that it is an iconic global consumer innovator manufacturer and marketer of convenient effective and valueadded products that consumers want and trust a company such as pg has too many levers to pull to achieve more consistent revenueearnings growth in the intermediate and long term the only question then for a potential pg investor is at what price they should consider buying pgs shares for a longterm hold and we refer them to our price range noted below for the suggested buying range our view every company can lose its way in their efforts to meet wall street and investor quarterly expectations pg is no different than any other company in this respect the company grew through acquisitions and new product introductions to a point where it became too unwieldy and the law of large numbers caught up with it to pgs credit it recognized its problems and retrenched towards its strongest most profitable core brands at great cost much to the chagrin of big investors searching for an easy fix with the company on a course that we believe will drive more consistent revenueearnings growth we believe that a stock such as pg a consumer product company should serve as a more conservative incomeproducing cornerstone of any overall portfolio as noted above larger scale adversities adversely affecting the company include an environment of global economic uncertainty and a strong us dollar pgs transformational efforts to adjust its product portfolio have also adversely affected its nearterm sales and profits pgs additional multibillion dollar cost reduction efforts also allow it to reinvest cost savings in product innovation and advertising to drive revenueearnings growth with its product portfolio adjustment behind it the company is engaged in several strategic moves  enhancing product and package superiority  emphasizing excellence of execution  focusing on cost and cash productivity and  ensuring organizational design culture and accountability we recommend investors read the transcript from the consumer products conference mentioned above the current pricetoearnings ratio for pg is about  and the shares yield  percent the companys forward pricetoearnings ratio is about  based on fiscal year  earnings estimates of  and about  based on fiscal year  earnings estimates of  we should note that estimates for each year remained relatively steady over the past three months we believe investors with a longterm horizon should purchase shares in a price range of  to  on a pricetoearnings ratio range of  to  based on fiscal  earnings estimates during the next overall market selloff and reinvest the dividend until the companys transformation begins to show improved results as noted in the articles title we trust in pgs ability turn its ship around given that it is a world class innovative product developer marketer and seller of multiple iconic billiondollar brands with few peers we believe the companys strategy to revive revenueearnings growth will reward shareholders for years to come with share price appreciation improved dividend increases and share repurchases click follow next to our contributor name at
