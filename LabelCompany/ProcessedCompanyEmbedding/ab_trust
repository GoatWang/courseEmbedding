you die in a manner that avoids probate and reduces estate tax you can also use it to provide for the management of property left to young beneficiaries this ab revocable living trust is for a married couple with combined assets likely to be worth more than the current federal estate tax exemption threshold this revocable living trust allows a husband and wife or registered domestic partners to transfer assets into the trust and to each stipulate how their assets are to be divided following their deaths in many cases one spouse or partner will leave their entire estate to the other spouse partly to allow the survivor to have the benefit of their assets and partly because the transfer is taxfree however if as a result of this transfer the value of the surviving spouse’s estate ultimately ends up exceeding the unified estate tax credit at the time of his or her death then estate tax will be payable on the excess this charge to tax or rather part of it can be avoided by using an ab trust this ab revocable living trust is a downloadable form it comes complete with guidance instructions on how to fill in the form as well as a variety of sample clauses including utma

complicated taxavoidance trust by mary randolph jd share on google plus share on facebook because of changes to state and federal laws in the last few years most couples no longer need to worry about federal estate tax but what if you set up a taxavoidance trust years ago you may want to act now to get rid of it and avoid unnecessary expense and hassle for your family law changes that make ab trusts less desirable several big developments in the law have made ab trusts—the most common kind of taxavoidance trust—much less desirable or needed increased exemptions for federal estate tax the amount that is exempt from federal estate tax has increased enormously for deaths in  each person can give away or leave  million without owing tax this exemption amount rises each year to adjust for inflation as a result fewer than one half of one percent of estates will owe federal estate tax so unless your family is one of the richest in the country you don’t need to worry about federal estate tax big tax breaks for married couples wealthy married couples can combine the federal estate tax exemption of each spouse giving the couple a total exemption of   million for deaths in  repeal of state estate taxes several states have abolished their own estate taxes of the states that impose them some exempt as much property as does the federal government but some exempt less  state estate tax rates are generally much lower than the federal ones and it may not be worth it to create an ab trust just to avoid state estate taxes marriage equality rulings samesex couples now get the same federal tax breaks as other married couples after a us supreme court ruling invalidating parts of the federal defense of marriage act the irs announced that it would treat all legally married couples the same for tax purposes whether or not a couple lives in a state that recognizes samesex marriage why not to leave an ab trust in place if you created an ab trust a few years back when the estate tax exemption was much lower and many more people paid the tax you may think that there’s no harm in keeping the trust after all it will ensure that your assets avoid probate and if there’s no estate tax to pay so much the better right but the truth is that an ab trust has some significant costs—and if you don’t need to avoid taxes they probably aren’t worth it a refresher if it’s been a while since you’ve thought about how these trusts work when one spouse dies the trust is split into two trusts trust a and trust b one is irrevocable the surviving spouse can’t change its terms restrictions on the surviving spouses use of the property  probably the most important drawback of an ab trust is that the surviving spouse has only limited rights to use the assets that are in the irrevocable trust typically the survivor gets only the income generated by the trust assets cost  when one spouse dies the survivor must hire a lawyer or accountant to determine how to best divide the couples assets between the irrevocable trust and the surviving spouses revocable living trust this decision can have important tax consequences trust tax returns  the irrevocable trust is a separate taxpaying entity the surviving spouse must get a taxpayer id number for it and file an annual trust income tax return recordkeeping  the surviving spouse must keep separate records for the irrevocable trust property how to revoke an ab trust as long as both spouses are alive you can revoke your trust and avoid the expense and hassle that will come after one spouse dies to do it right follow these essential steps transfer all of the trust assets out of the trust and back into your names this entails reversing all the work you did to “fund” the trust when you transferred everything into your names as trustees for example if you wanted to hold your house in the trust you executed a new deed transferring the real estate from you and your spouse to you and your spouse in your capacity as trustees of your trust now you need to reverse that and create and record another deed transferring the house back into your names as individuals not trustees create and sign a simple document revoking the trust let people know that you’ve revoked the trust if you’ve notified a lawyer bank financial adviser or anyone else that you created an ab trust now tell them that you’ve revoked it this will help avoid confusion after your death what you may want instead for most families a simple probateavoidance trust is better than the much more complex ab trust  a simple revocable trust is basically a substitute for a will it isn’t designed to continue past the death of a spouse instead the trust assets are quickly distributed to the people who inherit them no probate court proceedings are necessary after the death which saves money and hassle and because the trust doesn’t stay in existence for years no trust tax returns are necessary most people can make a revocable living trust themselves without hiring a lawyer to draft the paperwork but even if you do hire a lawyer to create the trust or to review your work the cost will be significantly less than you’ll pay either to create an ab trust or to administer it after a spouse dies share on google plus share on facebook talk to a lawyer need a lawyer start here practice area please selectairplane business

avoiding probate estate and gift taxes federal estate taxes us state death taxes inheritors guide glossary view all by julie garber updated february   married couples can maximize the use of both of their federal exemptions from estate taxes by using ab trusts as part of their estate plan the ab trust system can be set up under the couples last will and testaments or revocable living trusts the a trust is also commonly referred to as the marital trust qtip trust or marital deduction trust the b trust is also commonly referred to as the bypass trust credit shelter trust or family trust ab trusts and portability of the estate tax exemptionnote that beginning in  the federal estate tax exemption was made transferable between married couples this is referred to as  portability of the estate tax exemption and means that if one spouse dies in  or later and his or her entire federal estate tax exemption is not needed to avoid estate taxes then the unused portion of the deceased spouses estate tax exemption can be added to the surviving spouses estate tax exemption this in essence means that in  a married couple will be able to pass on up to  to their heirs free from federal estate taxes without the need to use ab trust planningso has portability of the estate tax exemption led to the extinction of ab trusts not exactly if the spouses have different sets of final beneficiaries such as in the case of a second or later marriage where each spouse has their own children that they want to inherit their separate assets after both spouses are deceased then the couple will want to make use of ab trust planning in order to ensure that their separate beneficiaries will be their ultimate beneficiaries in addition since currently hawaii is the only state among the states that collect an estate tax that has made its state estate tax exemption portable between married couples ab trust or abc trust planning may be required in these states in order to take advantage of both spouses state estate tax exemptions   finally the federal generationskipping transfer tax exemption is not portable so couples who want to double the use of their gst exemptions will need to use ab trust or abc trust planning to do sohow ab trust planning workshere is how the ab trust system works to maximize the use of both spouses estate tax exemptions the couple includes the appropriate ab trust language in their last will and testaments or revocable living trusts note that this should not be attempted without the assistance of a qualified estate planning attorney  the couple divides their assets so that each spouse has about the same value of assets in his or her individual name or in the name of his or her revocable living trust this is an important step and must be done in order for the ab trust system to work many times couples leave their assets in joint accounts and this completely voids the use of the ab trust system since the joint assets will pass outright to the surviving spouse instead of through the deceased spouses last will or revocable living trust  if the first spouse died in  then the first  would be funded into the b trust and if the first spouse died in  then the first  would be funded into the b trust  this effectively uses the federal exemption from estate taxes of the first spouse to die  the b trust can be relatively flexible and used for the benefit of the surviving spouse and descendants or other beneficiaries  if the deceased spouses assets exceed  in  or  in  then the excess is funded into the a trust this will defer the payment of estate taxes on the assets above the deceased spouses exemption until after the surviving spouses death because of this estate tax deferment the a trust is less flexible and can only be used for the benefit of the surviving spouse in addition federal law requires that the surviving spouse must receive all of the income from the a trust in order for it to qualify for the unlimited marital deduction  when the surviving spouse later dies the surviving spouse will still have his or her own estate tax exemption if the exemption is  when the surviving spouse dies then the first  of the surviving spouses separate assets will pass estate tax free to the final beneficiaries anything over  will be taxed  the assets remaining in the b trust pass estate tax free to the final beneficiaries this is because the b trust used up the federal estate tax exemption of the first spouse to die so anything left in the b trust will pass estate tax free this can provide a significant windfall to the final beneficiaries if the surviving spouse does not need to use the assets from the b trust and they continue to grow in value during the surviving spouses remaining lifetime  the assets remaining in the a trust will be taxed as part of the surviving spouses estate as mentioned above the estate tax on the a trust is effectively deferred until after the surviving spouse dies  the balance of the a trust that remains after the estate tax bill is paid passes to the final beneficiaries note that the beneficiaries of the a trust and b trust can be differentas illustrated above effective use of the ab trust system allows married couples to pass on up to  to their final beneficiaries free from any federal estate taxes ab trust planning also allows married couples to minimize estate taxes while insuring that the their separate estates will ultimately pass to the beneficiaries of their choice and in the manner of their choicewhat happens if the a trust is not needed enter portability of the estate tax exemptionwhat happens if the value of the deceased spouses estate is under the value of the federal estate tax exemption so that there is no need to establish and fund the a trust then the unused portion of the deceased spouses estate tax exemption can be transferred and added to the surviving spouses estate tax exemption by timely filing a federal estate tax return

the taxsaver download article as a pdf normally when one spouse dies passing on hisher assets in a last will and testament the estate will be taxed heavily before the beneficiaries receive it to avoid this steep estate tax spouses can set up an ab trust where each spouse leaves their property to an irrevocable trust an ab trust is a trust created by married couples to maximize their federal estate tax exemptions a lot of people believe that ab trusts only benefit those with large estates the truth is anyone who may owe estate tax can benefit from an ab trust follow along as findlaw helps you discover how ab trusts can be a taxsaver how the ab trust system works when the first spouse dies the beneficiaries usually the couples children named in the trust receive that spouses property however this irrevocable trust is to be used for the benefit of the surviving spouse who does not technically own the property there is a crucial condition that the property can be used by the surviving spouse and that the surviving spouse may even spend principal in certain instances once the surviving spouse dies all the property rights and benefits of the irrevocable trust pass to the surviving beneficiaries of the trust because the surviving spouse does not own the property it is not subject to estate tax setting up an ab trust this way keeps the portion of the surviving spouses estate that is taxable half of what it would be without an ab trust surviving spouses rights over the assets as mentioned the ab trust is left with the condition that it is to benefit the surviving spouse this gives the surviving spouse some power over the assets depending on the provisions of the trust the surviving spouses rights and benefits include receiving all income from the trust property including interest using the property spending to benefit his or her health support and maintenance standard of living and education the surviving spouse maintains these rights until her death at which time all of the property is distributed to the beneficiaries of the original trust and all of the surviving spouses property is distributed to his or her beneficiaries disadvantages of an ab trust the ab trust is irrevocable once one spouse dies there cannot be any changes made to the trust this can create some issues and has even caused friction between the surviving spouse and the named beneficiaries of the trust as mentioned the surviving spouses rights to use the property are limited where at one time this used to be the property he or she shared with his or her spouse to do with as they pleased this property is now restricted to certain uses and rights settling and distributing property in an ab trust can be expensive and often requires a lawyer and accountant furthermore these tax laws are always changing youll need to keep current or hire a professional to keep you current on these changes and what they mean for you and your trust these changes may even encourage you to change or even revoke your trust there is a lot of paperwork and bookkeeping required in an ab trust the surviving spouse needs a tax id number for the irrevocable trust and must file annual income tax returns on the trust he or she must also keep records of all the ab trust property is an ab trust is right for you an ab trust is best suited for those married couples who are both over the age of  and do not have children from previous marriages often times when there are children from previous marriages conflicts arise between the surviving spouse and the deceased spouses

trusts when it makes sense to hire an attorney and related issues types of trusts there are many different kinds of trusts possible though all trusts can be separated into two groups revocable and irrevocable trusts the key difference that one can be revoked and the other cannot is apparent in their names though the reasons for selecting one or another has more to do with other details about ownership and control a revocable trust often called a living trust are trusts in which the person making the trust transfers their title of property into the trust serves as the initial trustee and has the ability to remove change modify alter or entirely revoke the trust during their lifetime trusts of this sort are useful because the trust owns the property rather than the person making the trust as such when the person dies the property held in trust is not subject to probate an irrevocable trust by contrast is one that cannot be altered changed modified or revoked once it has been created revocable trusts may be vulnerable to claims by the creators creditors to access these assets the creditor will need to petition the court for an order enabling them to access the assets of the trust but the control the trust maker maintains in trusts of this kind is precisely what makes the assets vulnerable to creditors upon death a revocable trust becomes irrevocable there are many kinds of revocable and irrevocable trusts we detail many of the trust types and their characteristics elsewhere in this section setting up a trust trusts regardless of their type have some common features a trust is a transfer of legal ownership of property or assets from the property owner called the trustor to a person or institution responsible for handling the property called a trustee this property is held for the benefit of a third party called the beneficiary a trustee is often compensated for their management of the trust regardless of whether they are paid the trust creates a fiduciary relationship between the trustee and the beneficiary meaning that they can only act in the interests of the beneficiary the grantor may act as trustee but they still have the fiduciary duty the grantor may also be the beneficiary of a trust or among several beneficiaries the obligations created by these different roles are important to consider when establishing a trust many factors can influence the procedure for setting up a trust including the age size of the estate and the marital status of the trustor we provide information on choosing a trustee amending an existing trust as

avoid federal estate taxes estate taxes are taxes imposed on estates of a certain size over  million for  at the time of an estate holders death by dividing the trust into two parts when one spouse dies an ab trust reduces the size of the overall taxable estate with proper planning a couple who creates an ab trust may avoid probate escape estate taxes and preserve family assets structure an ab trust is created by establishing a living trust with an ab provision the trust remains revocable while both spouses are alive thus the couple may withdraw assets or cancel the trust completely before one spouse dies when the first spouse dies the trust becomes irrevocable and splits into two parts the a trust and the b trust the a trust contains the surviving spouses half of the estate the surviving spouse controls all the property in the a trust and may receive distributions of income and principle as needed the b trust contains the deceased spouses half of the estate the b trust belongs to the beneficiaries named in the trust—typically the couples children the surviving spouse has the right however to use the property contained in the b trust during life and to receive any income it generates in certain situations the surviving spouse may access the principe of the b trust when the surviving spouse dies the property in the b trust passes to the beneficiaries designated in the original trust document the assets contained in the a trust are distributed to beneficiaries named by the surviving spouse advantages of an ab trust the property in the b trust is never considered part of the surviving spouses estate thus only the property contained in the a trust is subject to estate taxes at the time of the surviving spouses death if the a trust contains less than the estate tax exemption then no estate taxes will be imposed even if the trust contains more than the estate tax exemption the total estate is significantly reduced for example if a surviving spouse dies in  with no ab trust in place and an estate worth  million  million of the estate will be subject to estate taxes after the  million tax exemption is taken with an ab trust however the surviving spouses estate would be worth only  million because this is less than the  million estate tax exemption no portion of the estate is subject to estate taxes additionally property contained in a living trust is not subject to the probate system which often results in significant expense and delays in asset distribution disadvantages of an ab trust there are several disadvantages to an ab trust accounting legal and administration fees must be paid to maintain the trust additionally after the death of the first spouse the a and b trusts requires separate tax returns the ab trust also limits the surviving spouses rights to the trust property a surviving spouse may feel entitled to all the property in the b trust and may wish to spend the trust principle this may conflict with the beneficiaries of the trust who wish to conserve the trust assets because an ab trust becomes irrevocable once the first spouse dies an ab trust should be created only after consultation with an estate

variety of purposes and may take a number of different forms a trust may be created to benefit a family member a charity or even a pet since trusts allow an individual to distribute his or her assets to others while minimizing estate income and gift taxes trusts have become an essential component of estate planning in the absence of nationally uniform trust legislation individual states have developed their own laws to govern the establishment and maintenance of trusts the uniform probate code upc which sets forth provisions relating to both wills and trusts has been adopted in whole by over  percent of the states creation of an express trust express trusts are created by a settlor who transfers property to a trustee for a valid trust purpose the trustee then distributes the trust property to a beneficiary pursuant to the terms of the trust the following definitions elaborate on the essential components of an express trust the settlor the settlor also known as the grantor or trustor is the person who creates the trust and transfers trust property trust property any type of property real or personal tangible or intangible may serve as trust property the trustee a trustee maintains the trust property and makes distributions to the beneficiary according to the terms of the trust a trustee may be a person or a legal entity the trustee owes a fiduciary duty to the beneficiary which includes protecting trust property investing prudently and making proper distributions the beneficiary the beneficiary to a trust is the person who benefits from the trust property a beneficiary may be a single person a group of people an organization or a pet the beneficiary need not be in existence at the time the trust is created trust purpose a trust must have a valid purpose a valid purpose is defined as any legal purpose trusts are most commonly created to provide for support education asset protection tax planning or to contribute to a charity types of express trusts express trusts may take a number of different forms the most common categories of express trusts are living trusts testamentary trusts revocable and irrevocable trusts fixed trusts and discretionary trusts living trusts a living trust or inter vivos trust is created for the benefit of another during the settlors life testamentary trusts testamentary trusts are created by a settlors will a settlors property is therefore transferred into the trust when the settlor dies revocable trusts a revocable trust allows the settlor to retain sole control of the trust while the settlor does not receive any tax benefits from a revocable trust the settlor can withdraw funds from the trust or alter or cancel the trust at any time irrevocable trusts the trustee of an irrevocable trust is given sole control over the trust property typically the trust will not come to an end until the trust purpose is fulfilled the trust may be altered or revoked before this time only with the consent of the trustee and all beneficiaries fixed trusts beneficiaries to a fixed trust receive trust property on a specific schedule set forth by the settlor the trustee of a fixed trust has little or no discretion to distribute trust property discretionary trusts a discretionary trust gives the trustee the power to choose how and when if at all to distribute trust property to beneficiaries a discretionary trust may provide significant tax benefits to beneficiaries since no beneficiary has an interest in trust assets until they are distributed other types of trusts while express trusts arise from the explicit instructions of a settlor other types of trusts such as constructive trusts and resulting trusts are imposed by courts as equitable remedies that prevent unjust enrichment constructive trusts a constructive trust is imposed when a wrongdoer acquires legal title to property that rightfully belongs to another under the constructive trust the wrongdoer becomes the trustee of the property with a duty to return the property to the true owner resulting trusts a resulting trust arises when an express trust fails the person who currently holds the property becomes a trustee and is obligated to return the trust property to the settlor today on verdict the forgotten side of police violence cornell university law professor joseph margulies comments on an aspect of police

initial paperwork    transfer taxes    difficulty refinancing trust real estate    no cutoff of creditors’ claims   living trusts are an efficient and effective way to transfer property at your death to the relatives friends or charities you’ve chosen essentially a living trust performs the same function as a will with the crucial difference that property left by a will must go through the probate court process in probate a deceased person’s will is proved valid in court the person’s debts are paid and usually after about a year the remaining property is finally distributed to the beneficiaries in the vast majority of instances these probate court proceedings waste time and money by contrast property left by a living trust can go promptly and directly to your inheritors they don’t have to bother with a probate court proceeding that means they won’t have to spend any of your hardearned money to pay for court and lawyer fees   tip you don’t need to maintain separate tax records for your living trust while you live all transactions that are technically made by your living trust are simply reported on your personal income tax return indeed while some paperwork is necessary to establish a probateavoidance living trust and transfer property to it there are no serious drawbacks or risks involved in creating or maintaining the trust these trusts are called “living” or sometimes “inter vivos” latin for “among the living” because they’re created while you’re alive they’re called “revocable” because you can revoke or change them at any time for any reason before you die while you live you effectively keep ownership of all property that you’ve technically transferred to your living trust you can do whatever you want to with any trust property including selling it spending it or giving it away a revocable living trust becomes operational at your death at that point it allows your trust property to be transferred privately and outside of probate to the people or organizations you have named as beneficiaries of the trust living trusts explained a trust can seem like a mysterious creature dreamed up by lawyers and wrapped in legal jargon but don’t let the word “trust” scare you even though it might initially sound impressive or even slightly ominous true trusts were an invention of medieval england used by aristocrats to evade restrictions on ownership and inheritance of land also true complex trusts have traditionally been used by rich american families to preserve their wealth over generations but happily the types of living trusts this book covers are not complicated or beyond the reach of regular folks here are the basics the concept of a trust a trust is an intangible legal entity “legal fiction” might be a more accurate term beyond a few pieces of paper you can’t see a trust or touch it but it does exist the first step in creating a working trust is to prepare and sign a document called a “declaration of trust” once you create and sign the declaration of trust the trust exists there must however be a fleshandblood person actually in charge of this property that person is called the “trustee” with traditional trusts the trustee manages the property on behalf of someone else called the “beneficiary” however with a living trust until you die you are the trustee of the trust you create and also in effect the beneficiary only after your death do the trust beneficiaries you’ve named in the declaration of trust have any rights to your trust property creating a living trust when you create a living trust document with this book you must identify yourself as the “grantor”—or for a couple the grantors the grantor is the person who creates the trust the “trustee” who manages the trust property you are also the trustee as long as you or your spouse or partner if you make a trust together are alive the “successor trustee” who takes over after you or you and your spouse or partner die this successor trustee turns the trust property over to the trust beneficiaries and performs any other task required by the trust the “trust beneficiary” or “beneficiaries” those who are entitled to receive the trust property at your death the “property” that is subject to the trust a declaration of trust also includes other basic terms such as the authority of the grantor to amend or revoke the document at any time and the authority of the trustee how a living trust works the key to establishing a living trust to avoid probate is that the grantor—remember that’s you the person who sets up the trust—isn’t locked into anything you can revise amend or revoke the trust for any or no reason any time before your death as long as you’re legally competent and because you appoint yourself as the initial trustee you can control and use the property as you see fit while you live   what is competence “competent” means having the mental capacity to make and understand decisions regarding your property a person can become legally “incompetent” if declared so in a court proceeding such as a custodianship or guardianship proceeding if a person tries to make or revoke or amend a living trust and someone challenges his or her mental capacity or competence to do so the matter can end up in a nasty court battle fortunately such court disputes are quite rare however if you suspect that someone in your life might question your capacity and the validity of your estate plan see a lawyer to help guard against a legal challenge to your estate   and now for the legal magic of the living trust device although a living trust is only a legal fiction during your life it assumes a very real presence for a brief period after your death when you die the living trust can no longer be revoked or altered it is then irrevocable a miniglossary of living trust terms here are a few key words about living trusts that you’ll want to know as you read this chapter  you’ll find a full glossary of trustrelated terms in the back of the book and nolo provides a complete legal dictionary at wwwnolocom some basic terms the person who sets up the living trust that’s you or you and your spouse or partner is called a grantor trustor or settlor these terms mean the same thing and are used interchangeably all the property you own at death whether in your living trust or owned in some other form is your estate the market value of your property at your death less all debts and liabilities on that property is your net or taxable estate the irs allows your successor trustee to choose market value at your death or six months later the property you transfer to the trust is called collectively the trust property trust principal or trust estate and of course there’s a latin version the trust corpus the person who has power over the trust property is called the trustee the person the grantor names to take over as trustee after the grantor’s death or with a trust made jointly by a couple after the death of both spouses is called the successor trustee the people or organizations who get the trust property when the grantor dies are called the beneficiaries of the trust while the grantors are alive technically they themselves are the beneficiaries of the trust   with a trust for a single person after you die the person you named in your trust document to be successor trustee takes over that person is in charge of transferring the trust property to the family friends or charities you named as your trust beneficiaries with a trust for a couple the surviving spouse or partner manages the trust a successor trustee takes over after both spouses or partners die there is no court or governmental supervision to ensure that your successor trustee complies with the terms of your living trust that means that a vital element of an effective living trust is naming someone you fully trust as your successor trustee if there is no person you trust sufficiently to name as successor trustee a living trust probably isn’t for you you could name a bank a trust company or another financial institution as successor trustee but doing so has serious drawbacks after the trust grantor dies some paperwork is necessary to transfer the trust property to the beneficiaries such as preparing new ownership documents but because no probate is necessary for property that was transferred to the living trust the whole thing can generally be handled within a few weeks often without a lawyer no court proceedings are required to terminate the trust once the job of getting the property to the beneficiaries is accomplished the trust just evaporates by its own terms see “trust administration after death of a grantor” in chapter  there are a few exceptions here first a wealthy couple may create an “ab disclaimer trust” to avoid probate and perhaps save on overall estate taxes when one spouse dies that spouse’s trust keeps going until the second spouse dies a lawyer or another financial expert may need to be hired to divide the ab disclaimer trust property between that owned by the deceased spouse’s trust and that owned by the surviving spouse another type of trust that can last for a long time is called a child’s trust the trust forms in this book allow you to create a child’s trust if you wish to leave trust property to one or more minors or young adult beneficiaries these trusts are managed by your successor trustee and can last until the young beneficiary reaches the age you specified in your declaration of trust then the beneficiary receives the trust property and the trust ends probate and why you want to avoid it given that you’re reading this book you probably already know that you want to avoid probate if you still need any persuasion that avoiding probate is desirable here’s a brief look at how the process actually works probate is the legal process that includes filing the deceased person’s will with the local probate court called “surrogate” or “chancery” court in some places taking inventory of the deceased person’s property having that property appraised paying legal debts including death taxes proving the will valid in court and eventually distributing what’s left as the will directs if the deceased person didn’t leave a valid will or a trust that distributes all of his or her property the estate must still undergo probate the process is called an “intestacy” proceeding and the property is distributed to the closest relatives as state law dictates people who defend the probate system assert that probate prevents fraud in transferring a deceased person’s property in addition they claim it protects inheritors by promptly resolving claims creditors have against a deceased person’s property in truth however most property is transferred within a close circle of family and friends and very few estates have problems with creditors’ claims in short most people have no need of these socalled benefits so probate usually amounts to a lot of timewasting expensive mumbo jumbo of aid to no one but the lawyers involved the actual probate functions are essentially clerical and administrative in the vast majority of probate cases there’s no conflict no contesting parties—none of the normal reasons for court proceedings or lawyers’ adversarial skills likewise probate doesn’t usually call for legal research or lawyers’ drafting abilities instead in the normal uneventful probate proceeding the family or other heirs of the deceased person provide a copy of the will and other financial information the attorney’s secretary then fills in a small mound of forms and keeps track of filing deadlines and other procedural technicalities some lawyers hire probate form preparation companies to do all the real work in most instances the existence of these freelance paralegal companies is not disclosed to clients who assume that lawyers’ offices at least do the routine paperwork they are paid so well for in some states the attorney makes a couple of routine court appearances in others normally the whole procedure is handled by mail because of the complicated paperwork and waiting periods imposed by law a typical probate takes up to a year or more often much more i once worked in a law office that was profitably entering its seventh year of handling a probate estate—and a very wealthy estate it was during probate the beneficiaries generally get nothing unless the judge allows the decedent’s immediate family a “family allowance” in some states this allowance is a pittance—only a few hundred dollars in others it can amount to thousands   resource read more about probate online to learn more about avoiding probate and estate planning go to nolo’s “wills trusts  probate” section at wwwnolocomlegalencyclopediawillstrustsestates most states now allow simplified probate for certain types of estates while simplified probate can speed up the process and may even result in lower attorneys’ fees the truth is that probate—simplified or not—is simply a waste for most people probate usually requires both an “executor” called a “personal representative” in some states and someone familiar with probate procedures normally a probate attorney the executor is a person appointed in the will who is responsible for supervising the estate which means making sure that the will is followed if the person died without a will the court appoints an “administrator” whose main qualification may sometimes be that he or she is a crony of the judge to serve the same function the executor who is usually the spouse partner child relative or friend of the deceased hires a probate lawyer to do the paperwork the executor often hires the decedent’s lawyer who may even have possession of the will but this is not required then the executor does little more than sign where the lawyer directs wondering why the whole business is taking so long for these services the lawyer and the executor are each entitled to a hefty fee from the probate estate some lawyers even persuade clients into naming them as executors enabling the lawyers to hire themselves as probate attorneys and collect two fees—one as executor one as probate attorney by contrast most relatives and friends who serve as executors do not take the fee especially if the person who serves is a substantial inheritor   extreme probate fees marilyn monroe died in debt in  but over the next  years her estate received income mostly from movie royalties in excess of  million when her estate was settled in  her executor announced that debts of  had been paid and  was left for inheritors well over  million of monroe’s estate was consumed by probate fees then there’s the  us tax court case upholding an attorney’s probate fee of  per hour for a total of  the court declared the fee was “reasonable under new york law”   while probate can evoke images of greedy lawyers consuming most of an estate in fees lawyers’ fees rarely actually devour the entire estate in many states the fees are what a court approves as “reasonable” in a few states the fees are based on a percentage of the estate subject to probate either way probate attorneys’ fees for a routine estate with a gross value of  these days in many urban areas this may be little more than a modest home some savings and a car can amount to   or more fees based on the “gross” probate estate means that debts on property are not deducted to determine value for example if a house has a market value of  with a mortgage balance of  net equity of  the gross value of the house is  example in california lawyers’ probate fees are set by statute section  cal prob code the fee for probate of a house is based on the gross value of that house given the prices of california real estate this can result in a lot of money wasted on attorneys’ fees for example a house purchased for  years ago may now be worth  the probate fee for transferring this house will be  that fee will be charged no matter how little equity the owners have in the house in addition to the probate lawyer’s fees there are executor’s fees court costs appraiser’s fees and other possible expenses moreover if the basic fee is set by statute and there are any “extraordinary” services performed for the estate the attorney or executor can ask the court for additional fees even england—the source of our antiquated probate laws—abolished its elaborate probate system years ago it survives in this country perhaps because it is so lucrative for lawyers avoiding probate the most flexible and complete probateavoidance method is undoubtedly the living trust however there are a number of other effective methods some of which are quite easy and inexpensive to use informal probate avoidance you may wonder why surviving relatives and friends can’t just divide up your property as your will directs or as you said you wanted if you never got around to writing a will and ignore the laws requiring probate some small estates are undoubtedly disposed of this way for example say an older man lives his last few years in a nursing home after his death his children meet and divide the personal items their father had kept over the years what little savings he has have long since been put into a joint account with the children anyway so there’s no need for formalities there for this type of informal procedure to work the family must be able to gain possession of all of the deceased’s property agree on how to distribute it and pay all the creditors gaining possession of property isn’t difficult when the only property left is personal effects and household items however if real estate securities bank accounts cars boats or other property bearing legal title papers are involved informal family property distribution can’t work title to a house for example can’t be changed on the sayso of the next of kin someone with legal authority must prepare sign and record a deed transferring title to the house to the new owners the inheritors further whenever outsiders are involved with a deceased’s property doityourself division by inheritors is not feasible for instance creditors can be an obstacle a creditor concerned about being paid can usually file a court action to compel a probate proceeding another stumbling block for an informal family property disposition is disagreement among family members on how to divide the deceased’s possessions all inheritors must agree to the property distribution if probate is bypassed any inheritor who is unhappy with the result can like creditors file for a formal probate if there’s a will the family will probably follow its provisions if there is no will the family may look up and agree to abide by the inheritance rules established by the law of the state where the deceased person lived or in either case the family may simply agree on their own settlement for example if despite a will provision to the contrary one sibling wants the furniture and the other wants the tools they can simply trade in sum informal probate avoidance even for a small estate isn’t something you can count on realistically you must plan ahead to avoid probate other probateavoidance methods besides the living trust these are the most popular probateavoidance methods joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety payondeath financial accounts transferondeath registrations transferondeath real estate

nolo while i’m a fan of living trusts i don’t believe they are always the best probateavoidance device for all property of all people in all situations it’s up to you to determine whether a living trust is the best way for you to avoid probate for all your property or whether you want to use other methods living trusts and estate taxes a basic probateavoidance living trust either for a single person or a couple does not by itself reduce estate or inheritance taxes the taxing authorities don’t care whether or not your property goes through probate all they care about is how much you owned at your death property you leave in a revocable living trust is definitely considered part of your estate for federal estate tax purposes that said some specialized types of living trusts not the basic probateavoidance kind may save on estate taxes this book contains one type of such trust —the ab disclaimer trust explained in chapter  however the usefulness of a taxsaving trust depends on whether your estate is likely to owe taxes—and most won’t for deaths in  only estates worth more than  million dollars will owe federal estate tax this exemption amount will rise with inflation in future years a handful of states also collect estate tax on large estates and the exemption amounts on some of those taxes are lower than the federal exemption but the vast majority of estates are not large enough to owe either federal or state estate tax and so for most people there is no reason to create an estatetaxavoiding trust if you’re worried about estate taxes you can learn more about them and the ab disclaimer trust in chapter  other advantages of a living trust as you know the main reason for setting up a revocable living trust is to save your family time and money by avoiding probate but there are also other advantages here is a brief rundown of the other major benefits of a living trust outofstate real estate doesn’t have to be probated in that state the only thing worse than regular probate is outofstate probate usually an estate is probated in the probate court of the county where the decedent was living before he or she died but if the decedent owned real estate in more than one state it’s usually necessary to have a whole separate probate proceeding in each one that means the surviving relatives must find and hire a lawyer in each state and pay for multiple probate proceedings with a living trust outofstate property can normally be transferred to the beneficiaries without probate in that state you can avoid the need for a conservatorship a living trust can be useful if the person who created it the grantor becomes incapable because of physical or mental illness of taking care of his or her financial affairs the person named in the living trust document to take over as trustee at the grantor’s death the successor trustee can also take over management of the trust if the grantor becomes incapacitated see chapter  when a couple sets up a trust if one person becomes incapacitated the other takes sole responsibility if both members of the couple are incapacitated their successor trustee takes over the person who takes over has authority to manage all property in the trust and to use it for the benefit of the grantor or grantors example wei creates a revocable living trust appointing herself as trustee the trust document states that if she becomes incapacitated her daughter lishan will replace her as trustee and manage the trust property for wei’s benefit if there is no living trust and no other arrangements have been made for someone to take over property management if you become incapacitated someone must get legal authority from a court to take over typically the spouse partner or adult child of the person seeks this authority and is called a conservator or guardian conservatorship proceedings are intrusive and often expensive and they get a court involved in your personal finances on a continuing basis   durable power of attorney you should also give your successor trustee or spouse the authority to manage property that has not been transferred to the trust if you become incapacitated the best way to do that is to prepare and sign a document called a “durable power of attorney for finances” see chapter    your successor trustee has no power to make health care decisions for you if you become incapacitated if you have any endoflife preferences—like to die without the unauthorized use of life support system—you’ll want to prepare and sign health care directives this is discussed in chapter  your estate plan remains confidential when your will is filed with the probate court after you die it becomes a matter of public record a living trust on the other hand is a private document because the living trust document is never filed with a court or another government entity what you leave and to whom generally remains private there are just a couple of exceptions first records of real estate transfers are always public so if your successor trustee transfers real estate to a beneficiary after your death there will be a public record of it second some states require the successor trustee to disclose information about your living trust to trust beneficiaries these requirements are explained in chapter  a few states require that you register your living trust with the local court but there are no legal consequences or penalties if you don’t registration is explained in chapter  also registration of a living trust normally requires that you just file a paper stating the existence of the trust and the main players you don’t file the document itself so the terms aren’t part of the public record in most cases the only way the terms of a living trust might become public is if—and this is very unlikely—after your death someone files a lawsuit to challenge the trust or collect a court judgment you owe them you can change your mind at any time you have complete control over your revocable living trust and all the property you transfer to it you can sell mortgage or give away property in the trust put ownership of trust property back in your own name add property to the trust change the beneficiaries name a different successor trustee the person who distributes trust property after your death or revoke the trust completely if you and your spouse or partner create the trust together both of you must consent to changes although either of you can revoke the trust entirely see chapter  no trust record keeping is required while you are alive even after you create a valid trust that will avoid probate after your death you do not have to maintain separate trust records this means you do not have to keep a separate trust bank account maintain trust financial records or spend any time on trust paperwork as long as you remain the trustee of your trust the irs does not require that a separate trust income tax return be filed irs reg §  you do not have to obtain a trust taxpayer id number you report all trust transactions on your regular income tax returns in sum for tax purposes living trusts don’t exist while you live you can name someone to manage trust property for young beneficiaries if there’s a possibility that any of your beneficiaries will inherit trust property while still young not yet  you may want to arrange to have someone manage that property for them until they’re older if they might inherit before they’re legally adults age  you should definitely arrange for management minors are not allowed to legally control significant amounts of property and if you haven’t provided someone to do it a court will have to appoint a property guardian when you create a living trust with this book you can arrange for someone to manage property for a young beneficiary in most states you have two options have your successor trustee or your spouse if you created a shared living trust manage the property in a child’s trust until the child reaches an age you designate in all states except south carolina you can appoint an adult as a “custodian” to manage the property until the child reaches an age specified by your state’s uniform transfers to minors act  in a few states  in most but up to  in a few both methods are explained in chapter  no lawyer is necessary to distribute your property with a living trust the person you named as your successor trustee has total control over how the property is transferred to the beneficiaries you named in the trust document with a will the executor is technically in charge of the property that passes under the terms of the will but the probate lawyer usually runs the show this can include the personal show as well as the silly court show i’ve heard of a lawyer calling a family in for a reading of the deceased’s will immediately after the funeral service which some family members found highly insensitive there’s much less chance of this type of crassness if only close personal relations are involved in the transfer of the property possible drawbacks of a living trust a basic living trust can have some drawbacks they aren’t significant to most people but you should be aware of them before you create a living trust aside from the problems discussed below an ab disclaimer trust which is designed to save on estate taxes as well as avoid probate has a whole set of its own potential drawbacks which are covered in chapter  initial paperwork setting up a living trust requires some paperwork the first step is to create a trust document which you must sign in front of a notary public so far this is the same amount of work as is required to write a will there is however one more essential step to make your living trust effective you must make sure that ownership of all the property you listed in the trust document is legally transferred to the living trust chapter  explains this process in detail transferring property into your trust is simply a matter of doing the paperwork correctly what you have to do depends on the kind of property you’re putting in the trust if an item of property doesn’t have a title ownership document then in most states listing it in the trust document is enough to transfer it so for example no additional paperwork is legally required for most books furniture electronics jewelry appliances musical instruments paintings and many other kinds of property if an item has a title document—real estate stocks mutual funds bonds money market accounts or vehicles for example—you must change the title document to show that the property is owned by the trustee of the trust for example if you want to put your house into your living trust you must prepare and sign a new deed transferring ownership from you to your living trust after the trust is created you must keep written records sufficient to identify what’s in and out of the trust whenever you transfer property to or from the trust this isn’t burdensome unless you’re frequently transferring property in and out which is rare example misha and david feldman put their house in a living trust to avoid probate but later decide to sell it in the real estate contract and deed transferring ownership to the new owners misha and david sign their names “as trustees of the misha and david feldman revocable living trust dated march  xx” transfer taxes transfers of real estate to revocable living trusts are almost always exempt from transfer taxes usually imposed on real estate transfers if you’re the cautious type you can check with your county tax assessor to learn if there will be any transfer tax imposed on transfer of your real estate to your trust your county land records office county recorder’s office or registry of deeds may also be able to provide this information as i’ve said you’re very likely to learn that no tax is imposed if there is a tax but it is minor it may impose no serious burden on creating your trust if the tax is substantial you may decide it’s too costly to place your real estate in a trust difficulty refinancing trust real estate because legal title to trust real estate is held in the name of the trustee of the living trust—not your name—some banks and especially title companies may balk if you want to refinance it they should be sufficiently reassured if you show them a copy of your trust document which specifically gives you as trustee the power to borrow against trust property in the unlikely event you can’t convince an uncooperative lender to deal with you in your capacity as trustee you’ll have to find another lender which shouldn’t be hard or simply transfer the property out of the trust and back into your name later after you refinance you can transfer it back into the living trust it’s a silly process but one that does work no cutoff of creditors’ claims most people don’t have to worry that after their death creditors will try to collect large debts from property in their estate in most situations there are no massive debts those that exist such as outstanding bills taxes and last illness and funeral expenses can be readily paid from the deceased’s property but if you are concerned about the possibility of large claims you may want to let your property go through probate instead of a living trust if your property goes through probate creditors have only a set amount of time to file claims against your estate a creditor who was properly notified of the probate court proceeding cannot file a claim after the period—about six months in most states—expires example elaine is a real estate investor with a goodsized portfolio of property she has many creditors and is involved in a couple of lawsuits it’s sensible for her to have her estate transferred by a probate court procedure which allows creditors to present claims resolves conflicts and cuts off the claims of creditors who are notified of the probate proceeding but don’t present timely claims on the other hand when property isn’t probated creditors still have the right to be paid if the debt is valid from that property in most states there is no formal claim procedure california has enacted a statutory scheme for creditors to get at property transferred by living trust the creditor may not know who inherited the deceased debtor’s property and once the property is found the creditor may have to file a lawsuit which may not be worth the time and expense if you want to take advantage of probate’s creditor cutoff you must let all your property pass through probate if you don’t there’s a good chance the creditor could still sue even after the probate claim cutoff and try to collect from the property that didn’t go through probate and passed instead through your living trust   sample chapter forms this book comes with a
