teamboard of directorsthe batteryproductspartnershipspresssearchprivacy statementtestingdatapagecontactinvestors about us our history team and board history the team board of directors powering energy innovation from a group of companies originally founded in toronto in the late s a team of russian scientists began developing a new energy storage technology that combined the energy storage properties of the commonly used leadacid batteries with the power and greater usefulness of carbonbased supercapacitors founded in  axion power was formed from these companies and set out to further advance the potential of energy storage solutions through improving this hybrid battery technology as axion searched for production equipment to move their pbc® technology to a full battery prototype they came across a pennsylvania lead acid battery manufacturing firm called new castle battery that was foreclosed and auctioning off their entire plant through some fast actions and good timing axion was able to procure the plant in late  and move the entire operation to the facility the new facility offered the ability to produce pbc® battery prototypes up to production batteries along with specialty lead acid products with a clear understanding of the original groundbreaking technology the team of engineers and researchers at axion power successfully developed the first complete carbon negative electrode lead acid battery in  axion power achieved a patent for their pbcⓡ technology and today holds  patents for it among other accolades axion power was presented the  frost and sullivan award for innovation in the field of lead acid batteries frost and sullivan recognized the technology as having the potential to “revitalize the lead acid battery industry by breathing new life into an established technology that is not well suited to the requirements of important new application like hybrid electric vehicles and renewable power” with the nearly  recyclable pbcⓡ battery axion

homeabouthistoryour teamboard of directorsthe batteryproductspartnershipspresssearchprivacy statementtestingdatapagecontactinvestors our technology a better battery battery overview what makes the pbcⓡ battery different our patented pbc® battery is a hybrid that uses the standard lead acid battery positive electrode with a supercapacitor negative electrode made of activated carbon the specific type of activated carbon we use has an extremely high surface area and has been specifically formulated by axion power for use in electrochemical applications during charge and discharge the positive electrode undergoes the same chemical reaction that occurs in a conventional lead acid battery ie lead dioxide reacts with acid and sulphate ions to form lead sulphate and water however in the pbc® battery we replace the lead negative electrode with an activated carbon electrode that does not undergo a chemical reaction at all instead the highsurfacearea activated carbon electrode stores the protons h from the acid in a layer on the surface of the electrode what makes us better the axion power pbc® battery is a powerful battery designed to bring electric innovation to your energy needs our battery has rapid recharge ​the pbcⓡ battery charges quickly and provides greater charge acceptance allowing for improved performanceincreasing productivity and reliability long cycle life our batteries are designed and built to provide a long cycle life which increases overall usefulness in various applications   minimal maintenance pbc® batteries are based on agm sealed non spillable technology requiring virtually no maintenance resulting in low operating costs and improved safety   environmentally responsible our pbc® batteries use less lead than traditional leadacid batteries and are nearly  recyclable   string stabilization when strung together and working as a team pbcⓡ batteries selfequalize without the need of equalization charges or complex management systems   manufacturability based on the existing leadacid platform our batteries are designed for worldwide manufacturing and can be incorporated into existing facilities    download battery specification packet   our battery vs lithium ion pbc® batteries have the following performance advantages when compared to lithium ion technologies faster recharge rates in partial state of charge applications   optimized string stability batteries selfequalize eliminating the need for complex costly battery management equipment significantly better safety record based on proven reliability of lead acid with over  years in service significantly better extreme temperature performance low thermal risk no need for liquid cooling similar cycle life at  depthofdischarge  cycles cost effective nearly

of companies originally founded in toronto in the late s a team of russian scientists began developing a new energy storage technology that combined the energy storage properties of the commonly used leadacid batteries with the power and greater usefulness of carbonbased supercapacitors founded in  axion power was formed from these companies and set out to further advance the potential of energy storage solutions through improving this hybrid battery technology as axion searched for production equipment to move their pbc® technology to a full battery prototype they came across a pennsylvania lead acid battery manufacturing firm called new castle battery that was foreclosed and auctioning off their entire plant through some fast actions and good timing axion was able to procure the plant in late  and move the entire operation to the facility the new facility offered the ability to produce pbc® battery prototypes up to production batteries along with specialty lead acid products with a clear understanding of the original groundbreaking technology the team of engineers and researchers at axion power successfully developed the first complete carbon negative electrode lead acid battery in  axion power achieved a patent for their pbcⓡ technology and today holds  patents for it among other accolades axion power was presented the  frost and sullivan award for innovation in the field of lead acid batteries frost and sullivan recognized the technology as having the potential to “revitalize the lead acid battery industry by breathing new life into an established technology that is not well suited to the requirements of important new application like hybrid electric vehicles and renewable power” with the nearly  recyclable pbcⓡ battery axion power delivers an array of energy storage
