thank you andrea and hello to everyone the us market started strong in  driven by investor optimism regarding the new administrations stated desire to lower taxes provide strong fiscal stimulus and reduce regulations to spur growth in this distinctly pro business environment markets and assets have appreciated and oaktree has performed well given that the animal spirits in the market have led to steadily higher valuations weve taken advantage of increased opportunities to sell assets out of our closedend funds at favorable prices at the same time we continue to deploy capital across all of our strategies in a disciplined and cautious manner with a focus on controlling risk and limiting the downside allinall realizations exceeded investments by a widening margin in the first quarter and we believe this was the correct posture to take for our clients our strong financial performance this quarter was highlighted by  growth in adjusted net income and  growth in distributable earnings both versus the same period a year ago these results were driven by higher incentive and investment income as we benefited from continued strong investment performance and significant realization activity in our distressed debt and other closedend funds additionally our share of doublelines net income which we account for as investment income continues to fuel our distributable earnings we deem superior investment performance with risk under control to be the most important thing we focus on at oaktree during the first quarter we achieved satisfactory results our closedend funds generated an aggregate gross return of  bringing the last  months return to  these returns coupled with continued strong performance across our evergreen strategies highlight the power of our incentivecreating fund platform in the first quarter we created net incentives of  million and net accrued incentives have increased by  over the past  months in terms of fund raising gross capital raised in the first quarter was  billion bringing this figure for the prior  months to  billion during the first quarter closedend capital raise included final commitments of  million for opportunities fund xb bringing total committed capital for that fund to  billion of the  private debt funds that closed in the last year opps xb was the largest its worth noting some of the statistics for the successful fund raised as they make clear the depth breadth and diversity of oaktrees client relationships around the globe over  limited partners committed to the fund and  of those were new clients to oaktree thus the opps funds continue to function as relationship starters for us as they have for  years about  of the capital raised was from clients based outside of the americas a higher percentage than for opportunities fund ix consistent with the previous funds the largest contributors of capital were public pension funds sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies we see our fundraising success in distressed debt as a direct result of the disciplined and patient approach weve taken in deploying capital over our history and of course in delivering strong riskadjusted returns of all of the  closedend funds created since oaktrees founding none have lost money for our clients on a gross basis demonstrating our adherence to the primacy of risk control throughout our history meanwhile we continue to make progress in fundraising for other funds such as european principal fund iv which has reached approximately € billion in committed capital as of march  and the european capital solutions private loan fund which completed fundraising this quarter with a total of approximately € million we continue fundraising for our various real estate vehicles including real estate debt fund ii currently at € million in commitments as well as raising our first evergreen real estate income fund and we continue to fundraise for middlemarket direct lending fund and emerging market debt total return funds in terms of our first infrastructure fundraise after receiving significant lp demand for a fund targeting transportation assets we decided to reposition infrastructure fund i into two separate fund vehicles with specific sector focuses given the transportation infrastructure teams differentiated expertise in public private partnerships and strong historical investment performance across the entire transport spectrum of land sea and air this quarter well begin marketing the first and only usdedicated transportation infrastructure fund concurrently well launch an energyfocused fund to invest in power and midstream infrastructure investments primarily in north america where we believe infrastructure is positioned for a surge of activity were optimistic about the prospects for the infrastructure strategy with the relaunch of these two sector funds turning to openend funds we experienced net outflows of roughly  billion for the quarter the majority of which were in highyield bonds and convertibles some clients have reduced their exposure to highyield bonds given the very strong recent performance of the asset class and the limited opportunity for capital appreciation at current pricing convertibles outflows were driven by two primary factors a shrinking market size and some performance challenges in our us convertible strategy using morningstar data as a reference point we note that us high yield and convertibles mutual funds also experienced net outflows during the first quarter counterbalancing this trend has been continued inflows to our openend european senior loan strategy where weve seen positive flows both directly from institutional investors and via our ccav  platform and finally we also remain active in marketing our new global credit fund a vehicle that combines the full breadth of oaktrees more liquid credit strategies within a relative value framework based on a dynamic asset allocation process overseen by our chief investment officer bruce karsh clients initial reactions to this multiasset strategy have been quite favorable and were now finalizing our first separate accounts we look forward to updating you on the progress of our global credit fund in the coming quarters and with that ill hand it over to bruce to cover the investment landscape bruce karsh  oaktree capital group llc thanks jay and hello everyone as jay mentioned owing to investors expectations that the administrations probusiness agenda will fuel economic growth in the us many risk assets began the year in an impressive fashion the sp s total return was  in the first quarter its best quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of  highyield bonds also extended the rally meaningfully outpacing their investmentgrade counterparts however after enjoying outsized returns through the first two months of the period optimism gave way to skepticism and volatility in march with credit markets and highyield bonds in particular under pressure in sympathy with lower oil prices declining equities and a rally in us treasuries after a price collapse in the first half of march highyield bonds were able to recoup much of those losses by month end and return  for the quarter emerging markets performed especially well during the first quarter outperforming developed markets by about  on the equity front in part this rally represented a recovery from the selloff that followed the us presidential election in addition strongerthanexpected economic growth rising earnings expectations strengthening currencies and continued growth in china all supported commodity prices and raised hopes for an acceleration of global growth against this general backdrop our emerging markets debt and equity strategies fared very well with returns ranging from  to more than  gross in the first quarter given the lofty valuations we see across our credit universe the opportunity in traded credit for our current distressed debt opportunities funds has largely disappeared since it ballooned in early  several of the energy and commodityrelated securities that we purchased during the first quarter of last year rallied significantly and our opportunities fund xa was able to realize a considerable amount of profits so where do we stand today absent an exogenous shock to the economy we continue to see a very benign default environment although there may be more bankruptcies in the retail space we wouldnt be surprised if the  highyield bond default rate is in the  range that would be about half last years rate which primarily consisted of defaults from the energy sector and the eighth year in a row of defaults below the longterm average of around  this environment as we said last quarter is not conducive to the commencement of a larger distressed debt fund such as our  billion opps xb meanwhile we can and will continue to recycle the gains in opps xa and are focused on select situational distress across a variety of industries such as retail healthcare and energy so as we mentioned last quarter assuming market conditions stay the same our current estimate for the official inception of the investment period for opps xb and thus the commencement of charging management fees on committed capital is likely to start sometime in  while we wait for a larger opportunity set we will continue to realize and harvest assets across our closedend funds as jay mentioned our status as a netseller continued in the first quarter as we realize substantially more than we invested across our closedend funds so far in the second quarter we are continuing the successful harvesting of fully valued portfolio holdings as you may recall last july we highlighted the successful ipo of advancepierre foods a portfolio company of our special situations group as a reminder the legacy company pierre foods was a classic distressedforcontrol situation wherein  the team invested  million to acquire the business through bankruptcy for an effective purchase price for the whole company of  million this week apf announced that it had agreed to be acquired by tyson foods for a total enterprise value of  billion the transaction is expected to close in the current quarter and the total cash received from this investment will represent approximately  times our invested capital and generate  billion in profits for an irr of over  clearly one of the alltime great private equity investments and certainly the standout in the history of oaktree its even more astounding to note that this is not a hightech company but a prosaic food producer and distributor needless to say were proud of the key architect matt wilson and the strong team who helped bring about the outstanding result they identified an attractive distressedforcontrol opportunity made multiple bolton acquisitions and one transformational one and most importantly added material value to this portfolio company through handson financial and operational expertise matt being from cleveland is on cloud nine at the multiple of invested capital figure of x  happens to be lebron james jersey number and michael jordans as well for those noncav fans out there but being a warrior fan myself i told him his next goal should be steph currys jersey number  i look forward to answering your questions but now im delighted to turn the call over to dan daniel dane levin  oaktree capital management lp thanks bruce and good morning everyone the first quarters financial results reflected continued strong investment performance across fund categories adjusted net income distributable earnings economic net income and net accrued incentives all grew substantially over the same period a year ago ill focus your attention on three prevalent themes that continued in our first quarter results one a disciplined approach to deployment of capital two significant realization activity across our closedend funds as illustrated by  billion of distributions in the quarter the highest level since the fourth quarter of  and three nearrecord levels of dry powder signaling our preparedness for change in market conditions management fees in the first quarter declined by  million from the same period a year ago the decline was primarily the result of a number of funds entering the liquidation period in the second half of  such as real estate fund vi european principal fund iii and highstar fund iv and our posture as a net seller in many of our closedend fund strategies while our management fees have been pressured in the current environment this same environment provides an attractive backdrop for growing the value of net accrued status and our balance sheet investment which bodes well for future distributable earning moving to feerelated earning for the first quarter fre declined  from the same period a year ago primarily as a result of the lower management fees i just mentioned while prudent cost management has been a particular focus over the last couple of years we manage those costs with a focus on the longterm need and growth prospects of the business thus we dont look to dramatically lower cost when revenues low for cyclical reasons we are committed to building a stronger and more scalable platform for growth incentive income grew  over the yearago period benefiting from our increased realization activity particularly in a distressed debt and real estate funds taxrelated incentive distributions contributed  of incentive income in the first quarter down from  in the yearago period investment income was strong in the first quarter at  million reflecting our funds solid investment performance and our  ownership stake in doubleline whose assets under management were  billion at the end of the quarter doubleline contributed  million to investment income in q and  million over the last  months our funds robust investment performance also benefited incentives created and therefore total accrued incentives and offbalance sheet asset that represents potential future incentive income net accrued incentives grew  sequentially in the first quarter and  over the last year to  million or  per operating group unit of this amount  resides in closedend funds that are in liquidation boding well for distributable earning and equity distributions over the next few years the increasing diversity of this pool of potential incentive income is notable with over  represented by control investing strategies and nearly  represented by real estate if you were to look at this balance three and fiveyears ago distressed debt funds represented  and  respectively compared to  today for the first quarter we generated  million in distributable earnings or  per class a unit we declared a distribution of  per class a unit in the quarter which brings our distribution over the last  months to  up  over the previous month period in summary  is off to a solid start in terms of adjusted net income distributable earnings investment performance fundraising and accrued incentives we continue to be disciplined with our pace of investment and therefore we reiterate our comments from prior quarters that we do not expect significant growth in our management fees until the start of opps xb investment period our continued nearrecord level of dry powder is strong assurance that we are well positioned for any changes in the investment environment and our continued harvesting of investments in our more mature funds bode well for future distributable earnings with respect to the second quarter to date our known fundrelated investment income proceeds are  million and we have no meaningful no net incentive income thus far looking out to the rest of the quarter as bruce discussed tyson foods announced that it entered into a purchase agreement with advancepierre foods our largest holding in principal fund iv our current estimate is that upon closing which currently is expected later this quarter assuming completion of the tender offer and that customary closing conditions are satisfied this disposition will generate approximately  million of receipts of investment income and at least  million of net incentive income with that were delighted to take your questions so laura please open up the lines questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session and our first question will come from michael carrier of bank of america michael roger carrier  bank of america merrill lynch hi thanks a lot guys maybe first question just on the exit activity and the realization outlook i guess maybe two portions to that first when i look at the net accrued that has increased a ton over the last year and just trying to gauge the portion that when youre selling i think it was  that you can realize right away versus the other portion you still have to kind of payout the lps before you realize the incentive so anyway to kind of gauge the timing on that like the  versus the full  million or so daniel dane levin  oaktree capital management lp yes thanks mike for the question so as you mentioned there is  thats currently paying but were also making good progress on the number of other funds in terms of getting to the point that they are paying and so in my prepared remarks i mentioned that upon the disposition of advancepierre we expect that principal fund iv will start generating incentive income and that is about  of our gross accrued incentives and so assuming that closes in the quarter we expect that that will be paying as of the end of the second quarter additionally theres a few other funds real estate fund v and power iii that continue to make good progress at moving toward the point theyre paying and thats why i think as a theme across all our comments we mentioned that the realization activity bodes well for kind of future cash flow and distributable earnings michael roger carrier  bank of america merrill lynch got it okay that makes sense and then just on the followup just on the fundraising it seems like you guys have a lot of products that are out there and youre making some progress on the openend side you mentioned whether its on the highyield that converts some pressure there so when we think about the outlook over the next year or so how do you see that kind of playing out meaning the activity that you guys are in the market with versus maybe ongoing pressures on the business and just strategically is there anything more that can be done maybe from a net basis maybe expanding at a faster pace jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc thanks mike look i think when it comes to openend fund flows the two key factors obviously are investment performance but also the state of the markets so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we also take a look at just as a data point whats happening with us mutual fund flows through morningstar data and for the most part our experience is consistent with that experience knowing specifically why our clients are investing andor redeeming its pretty clear to us in the highyield side that almost all of the redemptions weve experienced have been clients reallocating out of the asset class hopefully temporarily because of the incredibly strong run that highyield bonds have had probably in large part is due to what bruce mentioned historically low default rates half the historical rate for the last eight years and at this point given the pricing in the market its hard to see much capital appreciation convertibles a little bit of a different story the overall convertibles market unlike the highyield market has actually shrunk i think something like  over the last several years the entire market and weve experienced some of that shrinkage due to that because we choose not to be larger than a set percentage of the total market but also with our us convert product weve had some performance issues weve taken actions here earlier actually last quarter and were quite optimistic that going forward well have improvement on that so i think its really again mainly up to the markets in terms of the pricing of the securities and to also an equal extent but sometimes we cant even offset the markets is our own investment performance and high yields a good example of that michael roger carrier  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks a lot jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc i think i – yeah i want to add one other comment because its worth noting that the global credit fund which is our multistrategy offering of kind of our more liquid principally openend strategies is going to play a big part in our view of our ability to continue gathering assets going forward in a different kind of a fund obviously where were going to depend on asset allocation dynamic rebalancing relative value analysis so as i mentioned were just finalizing the first separate accounts for that fund and i think well have good news to report over the next several quarters on our progress there and that will help in a way feed assets into several of the openend strategies that we just referred to operator and our next question will come from craig siegenthaler of credit suisse craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks good morning everyone did any of the funds have a final close in q im just looking at the raises across european principal and some of the other products im just wondering any of them were final jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc hey craig good morning jay the ecs european capital solutions direct lending fund had a final close and i think i mentioned that the final assets there were about € million and then the other fund that had a final close in the first quarter was opps xb with the  billion final amount craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks jay ill get back in the queue operator the next question comes from alex blostein of goldman sachs alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co thanks good morning everybody just going back i guess to the timing on xb and kind of the pace of capital deployment so all that makes sense i think in the past you guys said that you still anticipate given kind of the current environment to turn the fuse on early in  it sounds like its a little less certain i think you guys just kind of move to at some point of  i guess a am i thinking about that correctly and b if this ends up being a much more prolong cycle of low default rates could we anticipate you guys potentially returning some of that capital back to lps bruce karsh  oaktree capital group llc hi alex its bruce well lets just start with what a difference a year makes a year ago if you looked at the high yield bond market there were probably  or more of the entire universe trading at stressed levels meaning  basis points over the curve today its probably  or less something like that so lot of things can change in a very short period of time we have no idea whats going to happen  or  or  months from now but our lps are very very patient and weve talked to our largest ones this week we had a lpac meeting went very well we talked about our projections in terms of timing for turning on xb i think they were very satisfied that were exhibiting discipline and patience and i think they were also very satisfied that were doing what we should be doing which is realizing fully valued holdings in earlier funds and finding opportunities to deploy and recycle our existing xa so theres really no pressure for us to do anything other than do the right thing and there is no need for us to give back capital and i dont think there is any desire on the part of the lps for us to do so alexander blostein  goldman sachs  co yeah that all makes sense thanks for the answer operator next we have a question from michael cyprys of morgan stanley michael j cyprys  morgan stanley  co llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question just curious if you can talk a little bit about the feerelated earnings and fre margin trajectory from here just given the strong pace of harvesting activities and the fees on the opps xb fund not likely turning until  just any color around the moving pieces there would be helpful daniel dane levin  oaktree capital management lp yeah so thanks mike the biggest driver of our fre margin is going to be our management fee trajectory and so over the near term as management fees are moderate due to our continued realization activity in our closedend funds youll probably see us having lowerthannormal fre margins over the intermediate term especially when opps xb starts its investment period and starts generating approximately  million of management fees we expect there to be a nice stepup in fre margins because there is relatively modest incremental expenses related to that fund so i think the longerterm prospects are bright but over the near term were probably going to be at lowerthenormal levels jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc if i could just add dan on the issue of management fees being the dominant driver absolutely and xb being the most important changes going to occur again absolutely having said that we have approximately  billion of dry powder  billion of shadow aum and so there is more of our shadow aum than just opps xb and also there are more aum that charges management fees on invested capital and so in a different environment where deployment accelerates there will be other drivers of management fee growth from the investment of our existing dry powder and shadow aum michael j cyprys  morgan stanley  co llc great thanks very much operator the next question comes from brian bedell of deutsche bank brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my question maybe just thinking on the other side on the – back to the fundraising and the differentiated strategies that youve continuously launched if you can talk a little bit about what you see as the infrastructure opportunity the sizing of the two fleets that you mentioned today and the potential future of that given what the administration is doing and then you also mentioned on the newtofirm investors on opps xb to what extent do you think you can crosssell some other strategies to those investors or do you think theyre more just focused on the distressed funds jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc thanks brian let me answer that in reverse order on the new to oaktree investors if the past is prologue its likely that new investors ultimately will become repeat customers and multiple product purchasers at oaktree as we sit here today close to  of our clients own two or more oaktree products i think there is something like  of our clients own four or more oaktree products and our strategy is to deliver outstanding investment performance and i think thats what primarily sells the other products and so if we keep doing that i think well see repeat customers and customers that invest in the multiple products and so i think i used the term that the opps funds had historically served as a relationship starter for the firm and thats the case again for opps xb i also mentioned yeah we think were very optimistic about the infrastructure opportunity first and foremost you have to have been in a cave for some period of time not to have seen an acceleration of media coverage and discussion about the infrastructure opportunity so theres certainly more chatter i think the need for infrastructure investments especially in this country is pretty well documented what we found when weve been out initially fundraising for the original infrastructure fund was that clients were looking for as you mentioned a differentiated offering and a sectorspecific offering and they honed in on our teams prior track record in particular in transportation land sea and air airports rail ports et cetera and so its with that information that we went back examined it internally and decided to come out and relaunch two sectorspecific funds as i mentioned transportation in the united states and we think thats the only transportationonly fund here in the us being offered and then energy infrastructure in midstream in north america and in both categories we think the demand is very large and so were optimistic about our fundraising potential over the next probably month period brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc im sorry did you give any size of the potential over  months for those two new funds jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc no were not establishing – being it so early in the process consistent with our past were not establishing any fundraising dollar goals per fund and that includes the transportation and energy infrastructure funds brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc okay fair enough thank you jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc thank you brian operator the next question comes from chris harris of wells fargo christopher harris  wells fargo securities thanks guys regarding monetization activity is it possible for you guys possibly to frame up how large this pipeline could be over the balance of  bruce karsh  oaktree capital group llc chris its bruce thats a tough one to answer obviously i can tell you one thing that in q of this year we realized in our closedend funds  billion roughly which is really about double what it was in q of  obviously weve got a major realization coming in q with advancepierre i can tell you that several of the groups are focused on realizations real estate in particular has done a great job of realizing that but the big funds distressed debt really in q accounted for about twothirds of the realizations and i expect that distressed debt will continue to a show favorable impressive realizations over the next nine months to quantify it its just really really hard as im sure you can understand i can just tell you that all the groups sort of see things the same way and sense that this is a great opportunity to realize are focused on harvesting and i just think youll see a continuation particularly in the bigger groups of good realizations but i just couldnt quantify it hopefully that gives you a little bit of perspective in terms of the first quarter christopher harris  wells fargo securities it does thats helpful thank you operator and our next question comes from robert lee of kbw robert lee  keefe bruyette  woods inc great thanks for taking my questions can you maybe just – i dont think this has come up in a while but maybe just update us on your thoughts from a strategic perspective as it relates to asia i mean obviously us europe you have emerging market franchise youre building in different places and many of your peers have been aggressively raising capital and expanding in asiaspecific strategies and understanding maybe the legal systems not as conducive to some of what you do in much of asia but can you talk about your thoughts there and where that stands bruce karsh  oaktree capital group llc thanks rob – thanks for the question robert its bruce ill start and just say on the opportunities funds side the distressed debt business for the first time about two years ago we decided we would start to make a real push into asia weve been very happy weve hired a couple key folks one in singapore named nick weber and one in hong kong named ray chan and theyve hired some people under them and were building groups there we sense theres going to be an opportunity in asia on the distressed debt side over the next couple years but we want to build our team and walk before we run and we did that very successfully in europe same strategy and right now in the distressed debt side we have as many folks in london as we do in los angeles so i have high hopes for asia pedro urquidi is leading the buildout there on behalf of the team and the only question is will the opportunity materialize to the extent we think it will and im optimistic theres a lot of debt thats built up in that part of the world and the interesting thing is whether well feel the way we invest in a riskcontrolled manner with creditor rights being respected will be the rule of the day over there we also have an emerging markets opportunities group led by julio herrera who currently is more focused on south america really and maybe eastern europe and less so in asia but i think at the right time that group probably will also start deploying resources over in asia so interesting opportunity our antennae are way up were gearing up for what we think is going to be an outsized opportunity an attractive one and well wait to see jay steven wintrob  oaktree capital group llc yeah if i could add to that bruce i guess as much of the investment opportunity in asia is truly that an opportunity the fundraising opportunity is here now and if you look at oaktrees results the last few years asia pac has been our fastestgrowing region in terms of fundraising but china but also greater asia weve added resources in the region focused on fundraising and that includes japan and so thats an active part of all of the fundraises i mentioned a meaningful component of most of the fundraises i mentioned and our expectations are based on the amount of available assets in asia and the relatively light amount that has been allocated to alternatives thus far that that growth trajectory should continue it wont be a straight line for us but it should grow over time and probably faster than both the americas and emea in terms of the growth rate operator and our next question is a followup from craig siegenthaler of credit suisse craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc thanks guys the accrued category bounce  had a really nice ramp over the next  months im just wondering what were the funds that really contributed to that and sort of an alternate to an earlier question is how should we think about the timing of the realization here especially with your european waterfall daniel dane levin  oaktree capital management lp so thanks craig in terms of the kind of  growth theres a couple of funds that have really contributed first of all principal fund iv has benefited from first the advancepierre ipo and then as we mentioned now they announced sale of the business so that has resulted in a nice markup in net asset value and thats the largest holding in the fund as well if you look in the fund table opportunities fund viii has had some nice returns over the last year and that fund has moved through the catchup layer on a marktomarket basis and so thats helped with the accrued incentives in terms of the outlook not sure how much more i can say than what we said in the second quarter assuming advancepierre closes as i kind of mentioned in the prepared remarks we expect approximately  million net incentive income related to principal fund iv as that kind of reaches what we call crossover ie starts paying incentives and goes through the  layer as well there is a couple other funds that i mentioned before real estate fund v and power iii that are moving towards that point and then the rest of the funds as we continue to realize and distribute will be making progress for kind of longerterm out so thats kind of how i think about our accrued incentives and how were going to over time move that through the kind of income statement craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc got it can i squeeze one more question in daniel dane levin  oaktree capital management lp sure craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc so just on opps fund viii which had sort of a nice lift over last year were there any themes or geographies or anything specific which should have drove the improvement there and drove it through  catch up bruce karsh  oaktree capital group llc our largest holding in fund viii is a public stock homebuilder called taylor morrison and homebuilding stocks last year languished but as the year progressed and certainly the first quarter that stock has improved materially as has its – its business has been and continues to be very very strong encourage you to take a look at the most recent quarterly report and outlook and youll see why were optimistic about that particular holding and i think its the largest holding maybe by a factor of three almost in that fund craig siegenthaler  credit suisse securities usa llc got it thank you bruce operator and this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to andrea williams for any closing remarks andrea d williams  oaktree capital group llc thank you again everyone for joining us
