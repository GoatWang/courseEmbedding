pdf largest indianapolisarea investment brokerage firms  excel city securities corp indiana’s oldest investment firm has agreed to be acquired by st louisbased stifel financial corp the sale ends a year run of ownership by the peterson family which opened the business five years before the onset of the great depression and built a preeminent position in the municipal bond business that continues today over the last three decades city has underwritten more than  percent of indiana’s municipal bonds terms of the deal which is expected to close in early  were not disclosed stifel parent of the fastgrowing regional brokerage stifel nicolaus  co plans to keep open city’s headquarters office in the former ls ayres department store building at  s meridian st but officials aren’t certain whether the company’s person workforce—which includes  wealth advisers in eight offices across indiana—will increase or decrease stifel ceo ronald kruszewski told ibj that his firm has been interested in acquiring city for about  years its a great firm and if they were ever going to decide to sell i wanted to do it kruszewski said business done well is a marathon not a sprint city securities ceo mike bosway who has been with the firm for  years and became chief executive in  said he and the majority of senior executives will stay after the acquisition kruszewski told ibj that bosway would have a leading role in the company but declined to provide detail he noted that of the  acquisitions the company has made since   former ceos are still with stifel bosway said several factors sparked the decision to sell one being the increasingly burdensome regulatory environment the government imposed through the doddfrank act following the  financial crisis post doddfrank one of the effects that it had on the entire industry was to lay a lot of additional regulatory costs on everybody—probably disproportionately on smaller firms bosway said so that was clearly a factor in considering this more so than we had in the past the need for scale today because of that is greater than it ever had been city securities has about  billion in assets under management in contrast stifel has  employees including approximately  wealth advisers and  billion in assets under management publicly traded stifel has been on an acquisition spree since the financial crisis it purchased new yorkbased investment bank kbw inc for  million in  alabamabased sterne agee for  million in early  and the us wealthmanagement arm of londonbased barclays plc last december stifel already has a major presence in indianapolis in part through the knall cohen group at parkwood crossing on east th street led by david knall and jeff cohen the group oversees some  billion in assets city securities is one of three longtime subsidiaries of parent city financial corp another city real estate advisors a syndicator of lowincomehousing tax credits was sold in june to omni holding co llc terms were not disclosed but one observer said it likely fetched more than  million the final company is city securities insurance llc an insurance brokerage founded in  bosway said the fate of that firm which employs  is to be determined we have reserved our options on the insurance brokerage until after decisions on the more complex business units—crea and the investment bank board member mark lubbers told ibj in an email we could either spin off to shareholders prior to close on city financial or place with an acquirer we will be  analyzing best outcomes for our customers employees and shareholders in the next few weeks city securities was the largest revenue generator of the three in  bosway said but he declined to provide figures city real estate advisors had revenue of  million in  company officials told ibj in june and was projected to soon surpass city securities ibj reported in december that city financial had hired the investment bank piper jaffray to assess strategy options—a step that often paves the way for company sales the story noted that city was at a crossroads in part because chairman john peterson son of founder j dwight peterson is  and has no family members on a trajectory to succeed him danny danielson petersons brotherinlaw and another major shareholder in the company died in may  at  bosway downplayed the role of aging shareholders in the decision to sell he said talks to sell city gained traction about a year ago and city started planning for ownership succession more than a decade ago” to say it wasnt a consideration is not true but it was not a major factor at all bosway said city securities is among a dwindling number of regional brokerages in the united states partly because of rising technology costs and financial industry regulations in indianapolis one of city’s chief rivals for years was locally based raffensperger hughes  co which was acquired by clevelandbased national city corp in  another big player locally clevelandbased mcdonald  co was acquired by clevelandbased keycorp in  its unclear if whether city will maintain its own brand bosway said but he believes the stifel acquisition bodes well for operations here weve been a market leader in indiana for decades and we really believe that this partnership with stifel just enhances our position in what we consider to be increasingly competitive markets” he said “so were really excited about the opportunities that stifel presents to our clients because stifel is going to provide us with resources that elevate our wealth management and public

securities class action lawsuits stock lawsuits securities fraud lawsuits securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms stockbrokers financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct these allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants in some cases investors can file securities class action lawsuits in other cases investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses free case evaluation send your securities claim to a lawyer who will review your claim at no cost or obligation securities and stock fraud stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the companys status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses claims can be brought against the issuer of the security ie the public company the companys officers directors or others involved in the violation including stockbrokers underwriter or auditors exchange traded funds companies that issued exchange traded funds etfs face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those etfs in their prospectus and registration filings with the securities and exchange commission sec in june  the financial industry regulatory authority finra issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse etfs noting that the etfs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session auction rate securities investors who put their money in auction rate securities ars have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe liquid investment however when the ars market was frozen many investors found they could not sell their auction rate securities some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the auction rate securities stockbroker fraud and stockbroker arbitration there are a number of ways a stockbroker or financial advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments recommending unsuitable stocks charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investors portfolio it is a stockbrokers responsibility to consider his clients best interest in all investment transactions clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and possibly the financial firm the broker works for stock options and erisa complaints erisa employee retirement income security act regulates employee benefit and pension plans both of which can be tied into stock options employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company andor its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk issues involved in erisa include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options denying an employee rights granted by a stock option agreement misrepresenting the value of the stock failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given furthermore it is a violation of erisa for an employer to take deductions from an employees paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan under erisa it is illegal for an employer to discharge fine suspend expel discipline or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan… claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan in such situations the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken companies that have had erisa complaints filed against them include yrc worldwide inc concerning the yellow freight pension plan motorola and sterling

independent attorney on an unlimited number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many factors get help deciding by answering a few questions here a specialist is

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many
