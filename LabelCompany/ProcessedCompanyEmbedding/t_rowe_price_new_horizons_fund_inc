investment objective the fund seeks longterm capital growth by investing primarily in common stocks of small rapidly growing companies strategy the fund will invest primarily in a diversified group of small emerging growth companies preferably early in the corporate life cycle before a company becomes widely recognized by the investment community the fund may also invest in companies that offer the possibility of accelerating earnings growth because of rejuvenated management new products or structural changes in the economy riskreward potential click on the riskreward spectrum below to view the funds in that category higher moderate lower by investing in smallcompany stocks this fund may offer greater opportunities for capital appreciation than funds that invest primarily in shares of larger more established companies in addition emerging growth stocks are often overlooked by the investment community and may be undervalued providing the potential for significant capital appreciationinvesting in small companies involves greater risk than is customarily associated with larger companies stocks of small companies are subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than largercompany stocks small companies often have limited product lines markets or financial resources and their managements may lack depth and experience such companies seldom pay significant dividends that could cushion returns in a falling market this chart displays relative risk of each us mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart methodology we evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific riskreturn category on an annual basis a fund is generally placed in a riskreturn category based on the year standard deviation of its performance if a fund is less than  years old the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years for an asset allocation fund with less than  years of performance history substrategy returns are used when a substrategy is less than  years old the actual substrategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full year history or longest time period available up to  years risk return categories overlap a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories denoted by a plus  is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of t rowe price when a fund has a cashlike benchmark denoted by a double plus  its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns if the fund is less than  years old benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate all investments are subject to market risk including the possible loss of principal standard deviation of returns a measure of price volatility is one measure of risk please consult the funds prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the
