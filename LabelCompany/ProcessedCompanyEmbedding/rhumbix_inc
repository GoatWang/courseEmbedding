advicelessmeasuring construction project success – rhumbix inc – mediumhomepagesign in  sign uprhumbix incblockedunblockfollowfollowingfounded by two united states navy veterans rhumbix is helping contractors build smarter and safer by empowering the bluecollar workforceapr  measuring construction project successrhumbix is based in san francisco where it seems that every neighborhood is dotted with cranes or scaffolding for most people a successful construction project is simply one that is completed they consider construction a nuisance because it slows traffic or is a loud distraction outside their window and are therefore relieved when the project is complete and life returns to normal but in reality there is so much more that goes into creating and delivering successful projectsat rhumbix our employees have worked on major construction endeavours all over the world and have experienced firsthand successes and failures on the jobsite below are a few areas we focus on when planning for project success and by extension what we are building into our mobile platformhealth and safety first and foremost did our friends colleagues and workers experience incidents or injuries while on the jobsite at rhumbix we believe productive projects are safe projects and vice versa so planning for project success will always rely on an effective health safety and environmental management program all incidents and accidents are preventable and appropriate safety management techniques and practices form the foundation upon which project success is builtbudgeting and forecasting construction involves so many moving parts that delivering projects at or under budget will always be a challenge cost is obviously a major resource constraint when procuring and executing construction but at rhumbix we believe that value delivered to the customer is a better metric for measuring price than simply the lowest cost the lowest bid is rarely the best price for the owner and often masks a significant risk that costs will rise contractors often bid on work knowing that design changes will enable the price to grow as the project scope is more clearly definedat rhumbix we believe that value delivered to the customer is a better metric for measuring price than simply the lowest costconstruction is such a dynamic process that changes in scope are difficult to avoid which is why realtime visibility and a transparent understanding of site operations goes a long way towards identifying the true factors impacting project cost performance and enabling more insightful and intelligent decisions that support budgeting and forecasting effortsplanning effective planning is without doubt the most important control tool for construction scheduling and cost management support project execution and planning gets them built planning is however complicated by the use of different systems and processes high level milestone schedules and management or control schedules exist in programs like primavera however more detailed look ahead and weekly work plans are often developed in excel or on postit notes in pull planning sessions disconnects between schedules and plans and offices and the field all complicate the development distribution consumption and feedback into construction planningrhumbix facilitates the sharing of information between developers of the plan and the people that actually have to use them by creating a feedback loop from foremen in the field to planners and supervisors assuring that plans reflect the reality of what can be built and what is actually getting built is key to effective project planningproductivity efficient use of resources is key to productive construction yet there are a myriad of factors that can hinder productivity from incorrect or missing materials to design clashes broken equipment to unexpected weather obstacles for work crews exist around every cornerconstruction is all about getting the right people and materials to the right place at the right time and effective communication plays a big role in making this happenat rhumbix we know we don’t have all the answers but the craftsmen at the work face probably do construction is all about getting the right people and materials to the right place at the right time and effective communication plays a big role in making this happen rhumbix provides a means for project stakeholders to communicate issues impacting productivity like never before we’ve built customised workflows and processes that aid in the identification of changing conditions and allow them to be recorded and quantified so meaningful action can be takenthere is no such thing as a standardized construction project and there is rarely a template you can overlay from a previous project that guarantees success projects that are large in scope and scale inevitably have lots of challenges and growing pains and even smaller projects can be enormously complexthe extent to which you can tie process and people together is going a long way to build the foundations and conditions that lead to successthis is why it’s so important to have the data you need when you need it success really hinges on connecting the dynamics of crews and project teams through sharing timely and accurate datathe extent to which you can tie process and people together is going a long way to build the foundations and conditions that lead to success for everyone involved whether you’re the worker who built it or the person who inhabits the built environment once it is

former naval engineers are trying to turn construction management on its head stanford graduate school of business alumni zachary scheel and drew dewalt are behind rhumbix a company whose product optimizes construction management and labor payment as well as divining best practices out of user data the company’s platforms is centered on a phone app with different iterations depending on user – different levels of data are exposed to project managers foremen and so on rhumbix leverages navigation and geolocation capabilities of smartphones to derive locations of construction workers and anonymizes them to the construction crew level the company’s potential is fairly large given the sheer number of construction projects ongoing globally at any given time perhaps this is one of the reasons that greylock just invested  million dollars in the company’s  million dollar series a this series a investment comes on top of earlier investments from darren bechtel’s brick and mortar ventures and michael paulus who is now a partner at andreessen horowitz httprhumbixcomindoorlocationbeacontestmp the bulk of the software is centered on using geolocation to accurately pay workers for the number of hours worked which is easier said than done as scheel explained construction worker salaries are amalgamated from a variety of different monetary pots each of which has its own cost code hundreds of cost codes exist on a site making this more and more challenging at scale rhumbix also tracks pay benefits and other compensation “fundamentally it’s costcode accounting” explained scheel “traditionally this has been done by foremen using clipboards which isn’t very accurate” more importantly rhumbix provides a vital medium for interaction between project managers many of whom are recent civil engineering graduates and experienced veteran construction workers “rhumbix asks them everyday how the project can make better decisions ” said dewalt explaining that he and scheel first learnt the importance of this interaction in the navy working with veteran crew chiefs   scheel explained that the inspiration for the product came from their experiences with blue force tracking a tool used by the us military to track friendly blue forces in a user’s proximity tracking friendly forces all over north africa while stationed in djbouti led him to think about the potential of a similar tool for tracking construction workers and optimizing their workflow “we’re creating something like the palantir for construction” said scheel in addition to giving managers a better understanding of where construction crews are positioned preventing colocation and doubleparking rhumbix has the potential to greatly increase the efficiencies at which construction companies operate the software reduces the amount of time crews spend idle waiting for instructions or tasks one of the larger challenges that rhumbix had to overcome was building a product that construction workers were willing to use “the data you collect from them workers is so valuable” said scheel “but you have to earn those rights” building a product that workers were willing to use is a lynchpin achievement if that doesn’t work the rest of the stack has no data to feed on one tool to encourage this is the way that rhumbix anonymizes individual data and only exposes the findings at a ‘crew’ level reducing reluctance to contribute the team backgrounds may have fed into this decision scheel managed construction at naval bases from everett wa to djbouti africa dewalt’s experiences as a nuclear submarine officer on the attack submarine uss cheyenne likely provided insight into the dynamics of crew members and managers in highpressure situations while it’s still early days from rhumbix the company is slowly racking up an impressive list of clients which includes anvil builders as well as some key subcontractors building the massive salesforce tower  shares advertisement

empowering the workforce with technology that delivers value to workers first two lives parallel paths same destination the fabled silicon valley startup story usually begins in a garage but for rhumbix the story starts at a military base outside djibouti city djibouti during the arab spring of  cofounder zach scheel was serving as a civil engineer for the military by day he was managing largescale construction projects and by night he stood watch in the joint operations center monitoring more than  us troops using a technology called blue force tracking that leverages gps to monitor soldiers’ locations the tool provided an extremely high level of visibility to military activity which was in stark contrast with the paper time card system he was using during the day with his construction teams a few years later zach and drew were both in chile working on large infrastructure projects over beers in santiago they realized that even though their projects were different the challenges they were facing with data collection and productivity were very much the same and could be solved if they had a tool like blue force to use on their projects when they returned to the states they officially founded rhumbix and in a matter of months they had secured seed funding and completed a successful pilotrhumbix’s first prototype was created by soldering together offtheshelf wearables to be worn by craft workers for our original poc it’s still in our office today and serves as a great reminder of the roots from which our platform was born mobile tools that help workers build smarter and safer drew dewaltcofounder and coodrew’s family has a rich military background his father and older brother both served in the air force and drew knew that he too wanted to serve his country while an undergrad at notre dame drew enrolled in rotc and upon graduation was commissioned into the navy as a nuclear submarine officer he spent over  years with the navy stationed primarily in pearl harbor hawaii and deployed to locations across southeast asia  after his service was complete drew enrolled in stanford’s graduate school of business to pursue a joint mbampp degree program with a focus on energy systems and infrastructure he interned at a few different energy companies while in school and shortly after graduating started the renewable energy company valhalla energia in chile with two classmates zachary scheel pecofounder and ceozach joined the military a week after september th he filled out a reserve officer training corp rotc application and enrolled at duke university to study mechanical engineering at the height of the arab spring zach was stationed in djibouti africa managing largescale military construction projects his other billets include serving as the resident officer in charge of construction and assistant public works officer at the naval station in everett wa after completing his military service zach enrolled in stanford’s graduate school of business where he interned with bechtel as an assistant area superintendent at the ivanpah solar electric generating system and project controls engineer at a copper concentrator in the
