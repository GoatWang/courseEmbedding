chemicals is spinning off its electronics materials segment into a new company called versum materials incversum materials has impressive market position and financial performance but is fraught with risksfrothy market conditions may allow versum to debut at close to  per share but investors should stay disciplined and wait for a common spinco trading pattern to emergebased on trading comps and a margin of safety  per share presents an attractive risk rewardintroduction air products and chemicals inc nyseapd a leading supplier of specialty chemicals announced in september of  it would spin off its electronics materials business into a new publicly traded company called versum materials inc nysevsm the spinoff process is expected to be completed at the end of this month and versum should begin trading monday october rd under the symbol vsm investment opportunity air products decided to spin off versum as part of its overall strategy to jettison slower growing business and concentrate on high growth markets so with growth eliminated as a primary investment consideration for versum and taking into account the risks detailed below whats left to make this a compelling opportunity valuation of course because of the specialty nature of the companys products high switching costs for its customers and low capital intensity the company generates high margins and a significant amount of free cash flow give the bankers credit on this one for bringing to market a highmargin cash generating business with a builtin return mechanism for posttransaction equity investors versum will launch with approximately b in debt actually b including a m revolver undrawn at closing at just over x leverage and with an initial debt to capitalization ratio of  the debt load should be manageable while also providing the experienced management team with an attractive use of free cash by paying down debt levels over time similar to a private market leveraged buyout every dollar of debt paid down should increase the equity value background versum will have approximately b in revenue on standalone basis and service the electronics industry by providing chemicals analytical technology process engineering and surface science services the company delivers these products and services though two main segments i materials and ii delivery systems and services dss the materials segment about  of total revenue provides high purity process materials cleaners etchants slurries the dss segment about  of revenue provides equipment for material handling and logistics primarily the design installation and maintenance of equipment for gas delivery and distribution customers include semiconductor semiconductor equipment and display makers with  of sales derived from memory and logic customers versums products and services target six of the seven steps in semiconductor manufacturing although the companys immediate addressable market is small at an estimated b in size the companys products are generally designedin to its customers manufacturing processes and are extensively tested and validated as such switching costs tend to be high the rapid pace of innovation in customer end markets mobile phones tablets gaming stations drives the need for innovation throughout the supply chain giving versum the opportunity to develop new valueadded products the company maintains  manufacturing facilities and six research and development facilities throughout the us and asia the business is generally low in capital intensity risks size company size is one of the primary drivers of defensive investing a proxy for risk as outlined by benjamin graham in his book the intelligent investor graham writing in  uses m in revenue as the safety cutoff for size to put that into perspective the smallest ten companies in the fortune  in  had average revenue of b as compared to average revenue of m for the comparable group in  with only b in revenue versums small size alone is a risk factor this risk is compounded by the small end market size concentrated customer base and rapidly changing nature of the technology market customer concentration versums top three customers accounted for  of its revenue in  cyclicality of semiconductor market versum is primarily tied to end market demand for semiconductors in the mobile handset market this market can be very cyclical in the first nine months of fye  the company suffered an  decline in volumes while versum expects volumes to recover over the next several quarters such a drop is a timely reminder of this very real risk trading strategy with valuation as the primary investment consideration its important to take an early look at where versum might trade after the spin more importantly its advisable to keep in mind the typical trading pattern of a lot of spincos joel greenblatt a very successful investor and former hedge fund manager wrote a seminal book in  called you can be a stock market genius in that book greenblatt explored why the strategy of investing in stock spinoffs can consistently generate excess returns greenblatt points out that shortly after a spinoff is completed the investors usually large mutual funds that originally held the parent stock will often sell the spinoff because it doesnt meet their investment criteria as a result of this initial bout of selling the spinoff price declines following the split and then gradually rises as it finds a new investor base while the markets have changed quite a bit in the twenty years since the book was written spinoffs still often follow this pattern and can provide a compelling opportunity with that said heres a look at my valuation notes taking a look at the latest form b and making some adjustments i come up with estimates for key valuation drivers and then back into possible share prices under two scenarios current market conditions and ii based on a combination of margin of safety investing and specialty chemical company trading comparables scenario  current market conditions versum materials   per share apd shares outstanding  ratio of versum shares to apd  versum shares os post trx  share price  market cap  debt  cash  enterprise value  multiple e revenue  x e ebitda  x e net income  x e fcf   debt senior secured first lien term loan b  senior secured first lien revolver  total thirdparty debt  unsecured inkind notes to apd  total debt ex lease and other obligations  scenario  margin of safety and trading comps versum materials at  per share apd shares outstanding  ratio of versum shares to apd  versum shares os post trx  share price  market cap  debt  cash  enterprise value  e revenue  x e ebitda  x e net income  x e fcf   debt senior secured first lien term loan b  senior secured first lien revolver  total thirdparty debt  unsecured inkind notes to apd  total debt ex lease and other obligations  note the m revolver is undrawn at closing and therefore excluded from the initial enterprise value calculation and valuation in scenario  i use current lofty market conditions and suggest a possible debut price of  per share in scenario  i use a large universe of three dozen specialty chemical companies with a median ttm evebida multiple of x to anchor the valuation while versums adjusted ebitda margin of over  is certainly much higher than the peer group average its lack of growth and much smaller size are offsets and will likely put downward pressure on the multiple taking into account post transaction capital structure peer group multiples and a reasonable margin of safety the above tables show a very attractive riskreward at  per share transaction notes the distribution date of the transaction is expected to be october   and regular way trading should begin on monday october rd however versum shares should begin trading before that on a whenissued basis sometime between the record date of september st  and october st conclusion versum presents a very attractive riskreward at  per share like most spinoffs it is currently unknown where the stock will initially start trading although current market conditions suggest a much higher price closer to  per share is possible patient investors could be rewarded if versum trades down after the spin like many similar transactions its a special situation worth keeping an eye on despite the many
