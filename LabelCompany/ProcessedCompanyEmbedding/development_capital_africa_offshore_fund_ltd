development in the middle east and north africa susan creane rishi goyal a mushfiq mobarak and randa sab š  international monetary fund financial development and growth  measuring financial development in the mena region  financial development in the mena region  conclusions  bibliography as countries in the middle east and north africa mena box  consider ways to promote more rapid and lasting economic growth further financial sector reform should be high on the agenda policies aimed at enhancing financial sector performance result in higher economic growth both theory and evidence support this proposition a more developed financial system promotes efficiency and growth by reducing information transaction and monitoring costs research in this area is typically based on a broad cross section of countries but comparatively little work has been done on the specifics of financial development in the mena region box  which countries are in mena the mena region covers afghanistan algeria bahrain djibouti egypt the islamic republic of iran iraq jordan kuwait lebanon libya mauritania morocco oman pakistan qatar saudi arabia somalia sudan the syrian arab republic tunisia the united arab emirates west bank and gaza and yemen owing to data limitations we exclude the islamic state of afghanistan iraq somalia and west bank and gaza in this study we review what the economic literature says about financial development and growth and draw general lessons for macroeconomic and financial policy after assessing financial sector development in the mena region we propose several policy measures to enhance this sectors performance drawing on recent research by the imf on the mena countries we evaluate financial sector development by constructing an index that encompasses six themes monetary policy banking sector development regulation and supervision nonbank financial sector development financial openness and institutional quality such as the strength of creditor rights using a subset of indicators for which data are readily available for nonmena countries we also analyze the mena regions performance over time relative to a few other regions overall we find that the relative strength of mena countries as a group include regulation and supervision as well as financial openness but they need to do more to reinforce the institutional environment and to promote nonbank financial sector development based on our measurements the mena region performs better than most other developing country regions but ranks far behind the industrialized countries and east asia however within the mena region there is substantial variation in the degree of financial development some countries have advanced financial sectors while for others progress in this area has been limited financial development and growth the theoretical argument for linking financial development to growth is that a welldeveloped financial system performs several critical functions to enhance the efficiency of intermediation by reducing information transaction and monitoring costs a modern financial system promotes investment by identifying and funding good business opportunities mobilizes savings monitors the performance of managers enables the trading hedging and diversification of risk and facilitates the exchange of goods and services these functions result in a more efficient allocation of resources a more rapid accumulation of physical and human capital and faster technological progress which in turn feed economic growth what leads to a welldeveloped financial sector conversely what hinders financial sector development these questions are the subject of a large and still growing research literature from which some general conclusions can be drawn in brief there is agreement that macroeconomic stability is critical for the growth of financial sector services countries should adopt appropriate macroeconomic policies encourage competition within the financial sector and develop a strong and transparent institutional and legal framework for financial sector activities in particular there is a need for prudential regulations and supervision strong creditor rights and contract enforcement what hinders financial sector development often the answer is governmentimposed restrictions and price distortions on the financial sector mainly so that it can use the financial system as a source of public finance in developing countries examples of these policies include high inflation taxation high required reserves ratios subsidized or directed credit collusive contracts between public enterprises and banks credit rationing and ceilings on deposit and loan interest rates or rates of return these conditions as a whole are collectively referred to as financial repression and a large body of research has shown that these financial repression policies undermine economic growth some studies have shown that a strong degree of financial repression results in lower per capita gdp growth of over  percentage point a year research also supports the thesis that financial sector development boosts economic growth in a wide range of studies the initial level of financial development is shown to be a good predictor of subsequent rates of economic growth physical capital accumulation and productivity growth even after controlling for income education political stability and measures of monetary trade and fiscal policy some studies have shown that countries with higher levels of financial development grow faster by about  percentage points a year however the direction of causation is sometimes unclear as financial development can be thought of as following or accommodating growth for example improvements in communication technologies could enhance financial sector efficiency similarly the financial sector could grow in anticipation of real economic growth or financial services may grow as incomes grow because people demand more financial services in summary our current state of knowledge on the issue suggests that a welldeveloped financial sector can facilitate growth and a lagging financial sector can drag down or inhibit growth prospects government decision makers should therefore facilitate and support the process of financial development and in addition eliminate financial repression conditions as an important element of their policy package to stimulate and sustain economic growth measuring financial development in the mena region to assess financial sector development in the mena region we construct a detailed set of financial development indicators research to date has been largely based on a few standard quantitative indicators such as the ratios of broad money to gdp and of credit to the private sector to gdp for a broad cross section of countries these measures though easily available and amenable to crossregional and intertemporal comparisons do not necessarily capture what is broadly meant by financial development financial sector development is a multifaceted concept encompassing not only monetary aggregates and interest rates or rates of return but also financial openness regulation and supervision technological advances degree of competition and institutional capacity such as the strength of creditor rights the financial structure of a country is composed of a variety of markets and financial products and it is difficult to conceive of a few measures that could adequately capture all relevant aspects of financial development the simple quantitative measures may also give a misleading picture of financial development for instance although a higher ratio of broad money to gdp is generally associated with greater financial liquidity and depth the ratio may decline rather than rise as a financial system develops because people have more alternatives to invest in longerterm or less liquid financial instruments going beyond the standard quantitative indicators some earlier studies used combined measures of market structure financial products financial liberalization institutional environment financial openness and monetary policy instruments these more detailed measures provide a richer description of financial development and motivate our measures of financial development in the mena region gathering the data against this background we began by collecting over  quantitative and qualitative statistics for  mena countries we surveyed the mena country economists at the imf to collect information on the nature of financial products and institutions in these countries we organized the data according to six themes each of which reflects a different facet of financial development  development of the monetary sector and monetary policy  banking sector size structure and efficiency including the role of the government in the sector  quality of banking regulations and supervision  development of the nonbank financial sector  financial openness and  the institutional environment economic rationale behind data on financial development controls on deposit or lending rates and on the allocation of credit are common modes of repression in underdeveloped financial systems forcing banks to provide subsidized credit to certain sectors or restricting the quantity of credit to be allocated induces distortions in the credit market and lowers efficiency one of the most important tasks that financial intermediaries perform in a market economy is to identify the most promising firms and investment projects and allocate capital to its most productive uses accordingly interest rate and credit controls interfere with this service the monetary sector and monetary policy theme examines the extent to which indirect monetary policy instruments are used by the regulatory bodies as opposed to direct controls on interest rates and credit allocation it also assesses the range of government securities that are available and how they are distributed and tries to capture the economys reliance on cash the banking sector theme captures the development of commercial bank markets and the ease of access to bank credit the choice of variables also reflects the assumption that commercial banks that operate in competitive environments with less direct government intervention low market concentration and where foreign banks are allowed entry are likely to be more efficient government restrictions such as interest rate ceilings high reserve requirements and directed credit programs on the banking system repress financial development owing to the information asymmetries and associated market failures inherent in banking sector transactions appropriate banking regulation and supervision is an important aspect of financial sector development regulatory bodies need to ensure that depositors interests are protected which in turn boosts confidence in the banking sector and eases the process of financial intermediation the regulation and supervision theme assesses banks performance with respect to minimum capital adequacy requirements and provisions against nonperforming loans among other items it also evaluates the transparency and openness of the regulatory environment this latter component in part responds to some recent research that suggests that heavy regulation and supervision in the absence of other key factors such as a strong institutional environment may not be consistent with financial development the nonbank financial sector theme explores whether nonbank financial institutions are present the theme further differentiates between countries where stock mortgage bond insurance and interbank markets are characterized by substantial trading activity from countries where these institutions exist only nominally with the trend toward globalization and integration of world capital markets the degree of openness of financial institutions has become an increasingly important component of overall financial progress the financial openness theme evaluates whether there are significant restrictions on the trading of financial assets or currency by foreigners or residents and whether the currency exchange system operates smoothly and is relatively free of interventions as with other components of the overall index the positive impact of financial openness is brought out when other aspects of the financial system are also well developed the legal and political environment within which the financial system operates is an important determinant of the range and quality of services that financial institutions can offer in many developing countries banks are reluctant to extend loans when an inefficient judicial system or corrupt bureaucracy and political institutions act as deterrents to the recovery of nonperforming loans the institutional environment theme tries to judge the quality of institutions that are relevant to the financial system financial development in the mena region analysis of the data suggests common strengths trends and weaknesses and points to future areas for reform mena countries in general perform reasonably well in regulation and supervision and in financial openness but they need to do more to strengthen the institutional environment and to promote nonbank financial sector development within the mena region progress on financial sector reforms has been uneven some countries now have welldeveloped financial sectors particularly banking sectors such as the countries of the gulf cooperation council gcc comprising bahrain kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates or uae lebanon and jordan others such as egypt morocco and tunisia have made important advances over the past three decades however overall more remains to be done the main findings for the mena region according to the six themes are summarized below monetary policy for the most part interest rates or rates of return are freely determined in the mena region indirect monetary policy tools are employed and government securities exist however the limited development or nonexistence of secondary markets for government securities hinders the broad use of open market operations by central banks in addition a few countries do not follow a comprehensive framework for designing and conducting monetary policy banking sector in a few countries such as many of the gcc countries the banking sector is well developed profitable and efficient but in about half the region this is not case in many of these countries the banking sector is dominated by public sector banks which are characterized by government intervention in credit allocation losses and liquidity problems and wide interest rate spreads or spreads in rates of returns in more than half the countries the banking sector is highly concentrated with assets of the three largest banks accounting for over  percent of total commercial bank assets and the entry of new banks is difficult and in many parts of the region there is an urgent need for developing modern banking and financial skills regulation and supervision many mena countries such as the gcc countries jordan lebanon morocco and tunisia have strengthened banking supervision and regulation they have established uptodate procedures to collect prudential information on a regular basis and they inspect and audit banks they have taken steps to conform to international basel standards by increasing capital adequacy ratios and reducing nonperforming loans however success in the latter has been limited and for most countries nonperforming loans remain in the range of  percent to  percent of total loans nonbank financial sector in most of the region the nonbank financial sector—comprising the stock market corporate bond market insurance companies pension funds and mutual funds—needs further development where such markets exist trading is usually quite limited the development of these markets is complicated by legal limitations on ownership and the need for a clear and stable legislative framework financial openness mena countries have gradually opened up their current as well as capital accounts nearly half the countries have open financial sectors although many maintain restrictions on foreign ownership of assets and repatriation of earnings some countries continue to maintain parallel exchange markets andor multiple currency rates institutional environment in much of the mena region the quality of institutions including the judicial system bureaucracy law and order and property rights is poor for instance in several countries the judicial system is susceptible to political pressure and long delays resulting in poor legal enforcement of contracts and loan recovery property rights enforcement also tends to be weak this hinders commercial activity and investment and hence growth new measures of financial development based on the abovementioned areas we developed six different indices which we then combined to construct a comprehensive index each of the six indices was a composite of between four and nine different indicators that allowed us to measure the various subfacets of each area the comprehensive index therefore was a combination of  different indicators and served as a composite measure of financial development we then grouped countries according to this composite index under three categories of high medium and low financial development to compute the comprehensive index we assigned a set of weights to each of the  indicators but to ensure robustness we calculated it using different sets of weights we found that the grouping of countries into high medium and low financial development categories was robust to the different weighting schemes although the relative ranking of countries within each grouping changed slightly see table  table  middle east and north africa financial development ranking level of financial development high medium low bahrain algeria iran ir of jordan djibouti libya kuwait egypt sudan lebanon mauritania syria oman morocco yemen qatar pakistan saudi arabia     uae     based on an index of qualitative and quantitative data – data scoring – with  being the highest level of development within each category the countries are arranged in alphabetical order on average countries at higher levels of financial development outperformed countries at lower levels in each of the six aspects of financial development see table  but countries in the highest third of financial development for the region received particularly high marks for regulation and supervision and for financial openness countries in the middle third also scored fairly well in these two areas however across the region countries fare poorly on development of a strong institutional environment and the nonbank financial sector see figure  table  mena comparative

public ownership of financial institutions  smaller or no monetary financing of the fiscal deficit  stronger prudential regulation and supervision  higherquality human resources including management and financial skills and  a stronger legal environment indices that attempt to capture several different dimensions of an issue in a single or in a small set of measures invariably involve choices of variables to use and weights to assign this imparts an element of subjectivity to the analysis and a biased choice of variables or weights could lead to incorrect inferences our own choice of variables and weights reflect our understanding of what is likely to be important to distinguish more developed financial systems from less developed ones and what is commonly found in the literature it also reflects constraints on what can be measured quite easily by altering the assigned weights we confirm that our qualitative inferences are not sensitive to the particular choice of weights mena and the rest of the world how have the financial systems within the mena countries developed over time and how does the mena region compare with other regions since information on the comprehensive index is not available at the required level of detail either for the mena countries over time or for other countries we used an alternative index we developed based solely on the available quantitative information this index is related to the one developed by beim and calomiris  and is based on quantitative data only to construct the index we combined four variables commonly used in the literature using a statistical technique called principal components analysis the four variables were ratio of broad money m to gdp ratio of the assets of deposit money banks to the total assets of the central bank and deposit money banks reserve ratio and ratio of credit to private sector by deposit money banks to gdp these variables measure the size of the financial sector the importance and relative ease with which commercial banks provide funds and the extent to which funds are provided to the private as opposed to the public sector aggregating across the variables not only attempts to capture different aspects of financial development in a single measure but also reduces biases or errors that may plague a particular data series furthermore in keeping with the standard practice of averaging the variables in either year panels or year panels to smooth out business cycle fluctuations and focus on trends we averaged the data in year panels to obtain observations for the s s s and s the rankings of countries within the mena region closely track each other under both the comprehensive and the alternative indices this provides some confidence in using the alternative index to make intertemporal and interregional comparisons in addition the alternative index produces rankings of financial development similar to those developed in other research according to the alternative index we find that most mena countries experienced financial development from the s through the s in the s many countries continued to experience financial deepening although in a few countries political instability or conflict resulted in a deterioration of the index see figure  our research indicates that the mena region ranks well below the industrialized countries in financial development but above most other developing country regions however it is interesting that although the mena region ranked well above the newly industrialized economies of east and southeast asia in the s it fell considerably behind them in the s and the s as these asian countries stepped up financial deepening with the exception of subsaharan africa financial development in all other regions has progressed considerably more rapidly than in most countries in the mena region the countries in the mena region in which there have been important advances in financial development since the s are egypt jordan morocco and tunisia see for example box  in the remaining countries the level of financial development over the four decades has improved only slightly or in a couple of cases declined figure  mena and global comparators quantitative index of financial development s–s   source imf international financial statistics decade averages scale – box  jordan developments in the financial system jordan has made solid progress in the monetary and financial sectors by implementing a comprehensive economic adjustment and reform program the reforms have resulted in a welldeveloped financial sector placing jordan among the mena countries with the highest financial development scores in all areas financial depth in jordan measured either by the comprehensive financial development index or as broad money to gdp is close to the highest in the mena region in the late s the jordanian government initiated a series of financial sector reforms to improve the structure and efficiency of the sector as a result interest rates were fully liberalized in the early s in  the central bank of jordan moved away from direct instruments of monetary control by issuing its own certificates of deposit to mop up excess liquidity in  the central banks rediscount subsidies and preferential credit facilities were eliminated except for small specialized banks involved in credit to the agricultural handicrafts and export sectors in the same year a new investment law was passed allowing equal treatment for domestic and foreign investors and further opening financial markets to foreign participation in  a new securities law was approved to improve the structure of the stock market capital account transactions in capital markets securities and money market instruments were also liberalized in  the central bank introduced an overnight repurchase agreement with commercial banks and opened an overnight deposit facility in  a banking law was approved which protects deposits reduces money market risk guards against loan concentration and contains articles on new banking practices ecommerce and ebanking and money laundering in addition government securities were introduced through a regular series of auctions in  a new public debt law was passed that bars any new direct credit facilities to the government and calls for the gradual repayment of outstanding credit lately the central bank of jordan has taken measures to outlaw money laundering activities and combat the financing of terrorist activities over the years monetary policy has been guided by the objective of supporting price stability the central bank mainly uses indirect monetary control instruments through weekly auctions of certificates of deposit more recently the government securities market has become active however secondary market trading for these securities remains limited the government has recently embarked on a new strategy for further deepening the financial system by issuing fiveyear treasury bonds denominated in jordanian dinars at regular intervals with a current yield of about – percent financial savings in jordan are primarily intermediated through the banking sector jordans banking system is fully privately owned welldeveloped profitable and efficient some banks have started implementing modern banking practices including automated check clearing and the use of magnetic check processors unified reporting forms and electronic datatransmission networks moreover several banks have started telebanking and ebanking services banks can extend loans and credit facilities in foreign currencies for traderelated purposes increasingly banks have started introducing new products and corporate bond issues the interbank money market has become prominent over the last few years there are  banks in jordan consisting of nine local commercial banks two islamic banks five investment banks five foreign banks and five specialized credit institutions dealing with agricultural credit housing rural and urban development and industry the banking system has jd  billion in assets  percent of gdp and a vast network of branches covering about  persons a branch however jordans banking system is highly concentrated with the three largest banks accounting for  percent of total assets the arab bank dominates the sector with  percent of all assets and the housing bank is the second largest with the most extensive branch network financial intermediation through the banking system is mostly shortterm however banks seek to match maturities by lending short term with only a few corporate loans stretching beyond three years in maturity a large proportion of the lending activity is therefore shortterm trade financing and consumer credit the authorities recognize the need for further financial deepening in  the jordan loan guarantee corporation was established to provide guarantees for small and mediumsized enterprises low and middle income housing and craftsmen in  the jordan mortgage refinance corporation was established to foster longer term mortgage lending at end loan guarantee corporation guaranteed loans amounting to about  percent of gdp and mortgage refinance corporation lending amounted to  percent of gdp prudential regulations and banking supervision have been strengthened considerably in recent years the central bank of jordan exercises strict controls to ensure that banks do not take risky positions on foreign exchange the riskweighted capital adequacy requirement was raised to  percent in june  all banks are well capitalized with an average riskweighted capital of  percent at end the regulations limit exposure to single borrowers moreover banks are subject to annual onsite inspections and frequent offsite inspections the nonbank financial system is well diversified as of  there were  insurance companies  authorized money changers  investment companies with assets of about  percent of gdp and a public pension fund with assets of both private and public sector employees amounting to about  percent of gdp in addition a new trust law will permit the introduction of private mutual funds by creating proper fiduciary requirements and standards the stock exchange market is well developed the amman stock exchange index increased by  percent in  buoyed by strong performance of the financial sector and the ratification of the bilateral free trade agreement with the us the index remained broadly unchanged in  despite substantial corrections in equity markets throughout the world the stock market capitalization to gdp amounted to  percent in  and the number of listed companies totaled  the corporate bond market remains underdeveloped owing to the absence of a secondary market for such issues jordan has a relatively strong institutional environment the central bank of jordan is independent of the government and its accounting framework is now in broad compliance with international accounting standards the legal system facilitates and protects the acquisition and disposition of all property rights the current peg to the us dollar seems to have served jordan well jordan accepted article viii obligations of the imf in  and current account and most capital account transactions are fully liberalized foreign exchange accounts are permitted both domestically and abroad there are no repatriation requirements on export proceeds real estate purchases are allowed if reciprocal treatment exists however nonresident investments are restricted to a maximum of  percent ownership in certain sectors of the economy notwithstanding this relatively high level of development for the region the need for further financial deepening is still felt throughout the economy for consumers greater supply of longterm fixed or partially fixed mortgages would make housing more affordable for a large portion of the population not covered under the government housing subsidies for corporations longterm investments remain largely financed out of shareholders capital or through foreign financing finally how is economic growth in mena related to financial development very little work has been done to determine the contribution of financial development to growth specifically for the mena region a potentially important aspect is examining the contribution to nonoil growth which is hindered somewhat by the availability of data preliminary regression work suggests a positive link between the two variables even after controlling for other determinants of growth this result mirrors the findings in the rest of the literature including in particular the role of macroeconomic and institutional factors in promoting financial development and growth nevertheless further work in this area remains to be done before the results are confirmed conclusions mena countries have reformed their financial sectors over the past three decades however while they have made progress their efforts have been eclipsed by faster reform and growth in other parts of the world against the backdrop of an increasingly globalized world the challenge for mena policymakers in moving away from financially repressive policies will be to implement prudent macroeconomic policies along with structural reforms macrostabilizing measures in turn should be complemented by creating the enabling structural environment for financial development including reduced government intervention in credit allocation and strengthened institutional quality particularly of the legal system efforts should be concentrated where financial development appears to have been the weakest for some countries this means less involvement of the government in the financial system including cutting back on public ownership of financial institutions and minimizing monetary financing of budget deficits enhancing competition investing in human resources and strengthening the legal environment experience shows that as policymakers implement reforms and stay the course confidence in economic policies grows with a positive impact on investment economic growth and employment over time bibliography abiad abdul
