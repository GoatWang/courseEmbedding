significant beliefs beliefs in a concern for the health of the animal a dedication to scientific research a regard for milk producer profitability key dates  lawrence bouma establishes boumatic milkers inc in ontario california  boumatic operates from a new location in ontario and distributes equipment via its bouma distributor agency  boumatic is acquired by madison wisconsinbased dairy equipment company and relocates to madison  boumatic becomes a subsidiary of the newlyformed holding company dec international inc  annual sales reach some  million  percent of which derives from outside the united states  boumatic parent dec international files for chapter  reorganization  dec sells boumatic to houston businessman john p kotts for  million company history headquartered in madison wisconsin boumatic is a leading dairy equipment manufacturer that serves both domestic and international markets the companys products include automated milking systems bulk cooling tanks integrated computerized management systems and more origins boumatics history can be traced to  when lawrence bouma established boumatic milkers inc in ontario california the new enterprise manufactured a line of milking machines for the dairy industry according to the company the boumatic milking system was scientifically designed for efficient milking while at the same time being gentle to the cow boumatic quickly established a good reputation within the dairy industry by  the company operated from a location at  west mission boulevard in ontario distributing equipment via its bouma distributor agency boumatic continued operations from the site on mission boulevard until  when it relocated to  euclid avenue boumatics next move was significantly further afield in  the company was acquired by madison wisconsinbased dairy equipment company as part of the acquisition boumatic relocated its manufacturing operations to madison a clintonville wisconsin veterinarian named john c dahl who would later become boumatics president played a significant role in dairy equipments acquisition of the small california firm after learning about boumatic milkers at a seminar dahl became friends with founder lawrence bouma also during this time he also served as a consultant to the dairy equipment company as columnist john oncken explained in the april   issue of the capital times dahls interest and research into the new milking system was a major influence in the purchase of boumatic milkers in addition the boumatic system was a complement to dairy equipments existing karikool and darikool product lines dairy equipment started to market boumatics equipment throughout the united states in  and the solid reputation boumatic had enjoyed in california spread accordingly boumatic and the dairy equipment company had similar histories in addition to being in the same industry both firms were founded in the late s dairy equipment was the brainchild of gilmon f albrecht a law graduate from the university of wisconsinmadison who worked for the james manufacturing company in fort atkinson wisconsin before deciding to start his own company in  his enterprise a wholesale and retail distributorship achieved rapid growth early on the company expanded to serve customers in  states by  at which time it was incorporated albrecht was a true industry pioneer as the boumatic web site noted albrecht saw many problems and inefficiencies in the can system being used for handling milk at the time cantype milk coolers required the dairy farmer to lift a full can of milk over the sides of the cooler to place it inside the refrigerated compartmenta backbreaking job for even the strongest individual dairy equipment company designed a cooler with an open front so the milk can could be slid inside this openfront can cooler was well received and the darikool line of milk cooling equipment was born albrecht proceeded to develop darikool bulk milk coolers in  which made the use of milk cans unnecessary following its acquisition of boumatic dairy equipment continued to grow and succeed in  it reorganized and formed a holding company called dec international inc following the restructuring boumatic became a dec international subsidiary new directions in the s by  the manufacture of boumatic milkers had been moved to the truax planta squarefoot airplane hanger leased from the city of madison for ten years in addition to boumatic milkers darikool milk coolers also were manufactured in the plant dec obtained the new plant because of strong growth within its special products division which made custom fabricated stainless steel products for a number of different industries in  john c dahl became boumatics president a position he would retain until  in addition to boumatic and the flagship dairy equipment company by the early s dec international had grown to include a number of other different enterprises including alkar berg company bowman dairy damrow company and falls dairy company falls dairy which was at the time among the nations largest producers of bulk cheese accounted for approximately half of decs  sales which totaled  million by the early s technological advancements within the dairy sector had changed the industry significantly decs boumatic arm was at the forefront of producing computerized equipment that made farmers lives easier and their operations more efficient in the november   issue of the wisconsin state journal columnist joe beck described the latest milking devices on the market some of which used microprocessors to determine when a cow was finished milking and automatically detach from her udders beck explained some of the newest systems now include computerized equipment that automatically checks records and analyzes milk production the computers record information on the production of each cow as it is milked and list cows in the herd in order of average individual production a deviation report identified cows that have dropped below their average production eight other reports available from the new systems keep track of information such as each cows reproductive status and summarize the days total herd production boumatic had evolved into a truly international business by the mids by that time the company attributed some  percent of its sales to international customers a percentage that was expected to increase as of late  boumatic had divisions in several different countries including australia england france israel japan and saudi arabia at that time the company was also pursuing markets in korea and taiwan dairy cooperatives in argentina represented an especially lucrative market for boumatic due to demand for the companys refrigerated milk tanks which held anywhere from  to  gallons of milk and sold from  apiece projections indicated that boumatic would sell some  of its coolers to argentina in  other south american countries including brazil chile and uruguay also represented promising markets despite its relatively strong international presence boumatic followed what some observers considered a conservative international expansion plan as columnist anita weler explained in the december   issue of the capital times the company adds no more than three or four countries a year to its market base in order to properly train distributors in installation service and use of equipment by the late s paul thompson was serving as boumatics president the company had made remarkable progress since the s benefiting from roughly  years of percent annual sales increases sales were roughly  million in  about  percent of which came from outside the united states these revenues accounted for more than half of dec internationals sales which were reported at  million that year by  boumatic employed  workers and held more than  patents related to dairy technology this number continued to increase as boumatic developed more hightech products that helped farmers do their jobs more quickly and efficiently one example was an electronic identification collar that transmitted such data as milking time and milk weight to the dairy managers computer where it could be stored in a database another product developed during the late s was actually a new attempt at something the dairy industry had tried during the s and again in the s in  boumatic was preparing to reintroduce rotary milking parlors which involve cows lining up on a moving carousel for milking ranging in price from roughly  to more than  million the best rotary parlors gave one or two technicians the ability to milk as many as  cows per hour innovation at boumatic continued into the s in mid the company was working in cooperation with a european firm to introduce robotic milking equipment to us dairy farmers once government regulations were met columnist rick barrett explained how the hightech equipment worked in the july   issue of the wisconsin state journal with the equipment cows will be able to milk themselves the hightech bovine wearing a computer chip in her collar for identification approaches a milking machine several times a day a robot equipped with laser sensors preps the cow for milking by disinfecting her teats and then does the milkingall in a few minutes according to barrett one robot was capable of milking some  cows per day new product introductions continued during  that year boumatic began distributing hydrafeed a milk substitute produced by hypredal laboratories that was used to remedy dehydrated young calves the company also introduced its flostar supreme claw a durable plastic milking unit intended for use in large dairy operations headed by president robert kmoch by the early s boumatic was widely recognized as an industry leader in the april   issue of the capital times columnist john oncken referred to the firm as one of the big three in terms of manufacturing and marketing of milking systems and bulk tanks to dairy farmers however at the same time boumatic parent dec international was in trouble having filed for chapter  reorganization in august  within the industry many observers predicted that dec would shed several of its  companies and retain boumatic new beginnings  and beyond instead of rebuilding around boumatic dec sold the company to houston businessman john p kotts and his madison one holdings company for  million in  according to the daily deal after receiving the green light from chief judge robert d martin of the us bankruptcy court for the western district of wisconsin kotts paid  million in cash for boumatic along with a promissory note to cover the  million balance in onckens april   capital times article dec international chairman randal albrecht grandson of founder gilmon f albrecht commented on the circumstances that prompted the companys demise explaining mad cow disease in europe brought the dairy business to a standstill a currency devaluation and energy crisis brought the brazil economy to a stop and a period of very low milk prices in the us in  slowed dairy expansion and a slowing economy hurt many of our subsidiaries banks get nervous when business slows down and debt mounts even though we never missed a payment the bank pulled the plug its a terrible financial blow for our family kotts who brought in a financial officer to address the companys challenges was new to the dairy industry his previous experienceas both an investor and business ownerwas largely tied to the oil industry especially in the gulf of mexico region following his purchase of boumatic kotts became the companys chairman and ceo according to various news accounts kotts bought the company because he was impressed with its products employees structure market position and potential for growth boumatic continued introducing new products after kotts took the helm including software that dairy farmers could use to monitor herds via handheld computers in august  boumatic began marketing pulsationmonitoring equipment for dairy farmers under the brand name pulseorater according to feedstuffs the new equipment was engineered to monitor dairy pulsation equipment aroundtheclock and detect changes or malfunctions in pulsation systems under new leadership boumatic remained positioned for success despite challenging conditions that led to the demise of
