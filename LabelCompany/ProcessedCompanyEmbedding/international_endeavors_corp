 our main competition will be from surrounding rv properties in the southern california and more specifically the temecula area there are approximately  rv parks within a  mile radius of our property our current site is considerably more expensive than other sites in the area as we only will have  rvs at any given time on the property which equates to almost an acre per rv we also aim to provide a different rv experience by providing wine tour packages and discounts to local establishments such as spas and restaurants in the area  wine competition we will operate in a highly fragmented market that is nevertheless dominated in the united states by a handful of extremely large volume producers according to the temecula valley wine growers association there are approximately  wineries in the temecula valley region and  growers according to data from the us tax and trade bureau and the wine institute in  more than  wineries operated in the united states with over  in california fredrikson explained that valuepriced wines made up  of california table wine volume in  while premium wines accounted for  of wine volume but almost half  of winery revenues we believe that on a smaller scale locally we can compete specifically with these large producers and other wineries for “shelf space” at retailers and at restaurants especially within the  to  per bottle range within this range we believe that the principal competitive factors are product quality price and unique label recognition and we believe that we can compete favorably with respect to each of these factors we believe that we will be an extremely small competitor to other vineyards in the private label market but we anticipate some of our chief competitors to be winery exchange inc the company cofounded by phil hurst vintage wine estates delicato family vineyards bronco wines ej gallo winery constellation brands inc and other california and international wine producers while they operate strong businesses run by executives we respect we believe the private label market is growing and has room for many players we recognize the tremendous competition that we would face however for a small vineyardwinery we
