bit of surface mineralization ex brass zinc stainless steel surfaces etc can be washed and dried with soap and water and then further prepared with a light scrubbing from steel wool to remove the

are in a well ventilated area and that the surface intended for application is completely dry open the oz bottle of rustoleum recolor and carefully pour it onto one of the provided microfiber applicators we recommend the sponge for restoring textured surfaces or the cloths for smooth surfaces pour enough recolor to completely saturate the applicator such that it is nearly dripping it is important that the applicator is saturated to avoid streaking during the application wipe over the surface in a single wipe from one row to the next with a slight overlap like mowing a lawn until the surface is completely coated it is not necessary to scrub or buff the surface–doing so will lead to undesirable results and product waste if streaking on the surface appears then rewet the applicator and continue the application process it is important to complete the surface that you started before recolor by wipe new® dries so that the coat cures evenly on plastic or vinyl surfaces
