financing options × is tim ho wan the best dim sum in the world  to live and dine home world region asia is tim ho wan the best dim sum in the world asia comfort food first world topics restaurant reviews taipei taiwan world regionjuly  is tim ho wan the best dim sum in the worldby to live and dine tim ho wan is the best dim sum restaurant in the world  it has a michelin star in hong kong but this is the taipei location without a michelin star   the only other chinese “brunch” restaurant with a michelin star is din tai fung  however the tim ho wan and din tai fung taipei locations aren’t rated by the michelin guide  who really gives a flying fuck though   what true foodies want to know is whether the food is consistent and good  right restaurant sign by chance i stumbled upon taipei’s tim ho wan  i wanted to eat at fuhang doujiang but they were closed so i opted for tim ho wan  i hopped on the mta then hopped off at the taipei main station  tim ho wan was across the street  i didn’t realized it was the same tim ho wan in hong kong until i sat down and looked at the menu  i guess i had a little food serendipity then the weight gain began tim ho wan is a steal relative to other michelin starred restaurants  it was much cheaper than din tai fung  they keep it simple with their limited menu  furthermore the food is freshly made and it’s not pushed around in those clunky steal carts  the clunky steal carts that usually bang against your elbows  yes those damn things like my original din tai fung meal i ordered all the traditional dim sum items with a few other not so traditional  furthermore shiu  mai and har gow were two must order dim sum dishes  here were my absolute favorite items shiu mai – the typical crab roe was topping was missing on each dumpling  however it didn’t stop the flavor  each shiu mai had an amazingly plump and juicy taste to them  the shiu mai’s soft golden wrapping was delicate yet strong enough to hold everything together  it was succulent tasty full of flavor and a little sweet  it was on par with the tim ho wan in hong kong  it makes me want to leave my wife and kids then move to hong kong for the dim sum shiu mai har gow – the minced shrimp was wrapped with a translucent wheat and tapioca starch  it was taunting me to eat it so i gobbled it up  the wrapper stuck to my chopsticks but it broke away as i took a bite  the morsels were succulent and flavorful  it was fantastic  however it was slightly below its hong kong counterpart har gow pork bun – this is one of the reason tim ho wan is famous  the crispy yet buttery outer shell came apart easily as i bit into the warm pork bun  the sweet barbecue pork was amazing  if this is gluttony i’m going to be sinning all day  gym can kiss my ass cause he’s the biggest jerk in town pork bun lastly tim ho wan is the best dim sum i’ve ever had in my life  easily  my second favorite dim sum restaurant would be hong kong’s one dim sum  luckily for the world tim ho wan is slowly expanding around the world with its latest location in new york  however i would expect to pay my soul for the meal like how i did with ichiran’s brooklyn branch  capitalism at its finest  bastards service    presentation    flavors    decor    ambiance    summary tim ho wan is the best dim sum restaurant in the world  it has a michelin star in hong kong but this is the taipei location without a michelin star  tim ho wan is the best dim sum ive ever had in my life  easily  my second favorite dim sum restaurant would be hong kongs one dim sum    user rating   votes sending
