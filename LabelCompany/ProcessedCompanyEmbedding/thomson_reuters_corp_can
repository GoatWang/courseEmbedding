products thomsons worldscope a global fundamentals product reuters estimates an earnings estimates product and reuters aftermarket embargoed research database an analyst research distribution product the proposed settlement further requires the licensing of related intellectual property access to personnel and transitional support to ensure that the buyer of each set of data can continue to update its database so as to continue to offer users a viable and competitive product the european commission imposed similar divestments according to the commissions press release the parties committed to divest the databases containing the content sets of such financial information products together with relevant assets personnel and customer base as appropriate to allow purchasers of the databases and assets to quickly establish themselves as a credible competitive force in the marketplace in competition with the merged entity reestablishing the premerger rivalry in the respective fields these

chairman of the reuters founders share company explained that the reuters trusts first principle had been waived for the thomson family because of the poor financial circumstances that reuters had

been waived for the thomson family because of the poor financial circumstances that reuters had been in stating the future of reuters takes precedence over the principles if reuters were not strong

ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the thomson reuters first quarter  earnings call and as a reminder this conference is being recorded ill now turn the conference over to frank golden senior vice president investor relations please go ahead sir frank j golden  thomson reuters corp good morning and thank you for joining us as well report our financial results for the first quarter of the year well begin as we normally do with our ceo jim smith followed by our cfo stephane bello now following their presentations well open the call for questions and wed appreciate it if you would limit yourself to one question each in order to enable us to get to as many as possible now two items to bring to your attention before we get started this morning first a reminder that todays presentation when we compared performance periodonperiod we look at revenue growth rates before currency as we believe this provides the best basis to measure the underlying performance of the business and secondly youll note in todays presentation and earnings release that we no longer report on underlying operating profit this change reflects the simplification of our reporting structure and is in line with how we currently manage the business internally change is also consistent with how we provided our guidance for  during our fourth quarter earnings in february let me point out that on the last page of todays earnings release there is a supplemental schedule that does provide depreciation and amortization expense by business unit as well as on a consolidated basis so you are able to do that calculation now todays presentation contains forwardlooking statements actual results may differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties discussed in reports and filings that we provide to regulatory agencies you can access these documents on our website or by contacting our investor relations department i will now turn it over to jim smith who will take us through the results jim james c smith  thomson reuters corp thank you frank and thanks to all of you on the call for joining us today i am pleased to report that our first quarter results were solid across the board and marked a good start to  reported revenues increased  andor up  on a constant currency basis both representing an improvement over the prior year this improved revenue growth performance coupled with savings from our transformation program that includes the actions we took in the fourth quarter of last year led to a  increase in ebitda and a more than basispoint improvement in margin adjusted eps increased  or  from a year ago to  most of this improvement was driven by stronger operating performance as belowtheline items remained fairly constant on a yearoveryear basis both the margin and the eps performance for the quarter represent record highs for the company finally net sales were positive in our financial business which was a good performance especially since were in the final stages of migrating a number of legacy products to eikon in our asset management and foreign exchange segments now let me turn to the results for the quarter by business revenues for our financial business increased  excluding the impact of acquisitions recoveries and pricing adjustments organic revenue rose  with all three geographies emea the americas and asia reporting revenue growth growth was driven by a  increase in revenues from our elektron data platform and risk businesses and a  increase in transaction revenues this was offset somewhat by a  decline in desktop revenues driven in part by the pricing adjustments we discussed as i just mentioned net sales were positive for the quarter driven by growth in emea and asia although the americas were negative due to the migration of legacy thomson one products to eikon these legacy asset management migrations are expected to be completed by midyear turning to legal revenues grew  in spite of declines in us print and transaction revenues importantly subscription revenues which represent about three quarters of our legal revenue base grew a healthy  finally tax  accounting is off to a strong start with revenue growth of  driven by our professional and corporate businesses now before i turn it over to stephane let me finish by reiterating our key priorities for  and im pleased to say that were making good progress against each of them and were increasingly confident as we look ahead first we continue to expect revenue growth to gradually accelerate as we execute on these key initiatives that are in process and continue to invest behind our highergrowth businesses were also in the early stages of executing our plan to improve the customer experience as we work to eliminate customer pain points and make it easier for our customers to do business with us we expect these efforts will further improve retention and help us grow revenue second our enterprise group is doing a great job of managing the transformation programs and we are on track to deliver further savings and productivity gains this year but just as importantly this group is now applying the same rigor and discipline towards driving a number of key initiatives aimed at improving both customer experience and sales productivity and thirdly given our strong start to the year we are confident we can deliver on our financial commitments and therefore we reaffirm our full year  guidance now let me turn it over to stephane stephane bello  thomson reuters corp thank you jim before i begin discussing the results id like to remind you that i will talk to revenue growth before currency as we always do as we believe that this is the most appropriate way to judge the performance of the business in addition currency did not have a material impact this quarter on profitability metrics for each of our businesses as such i will be referring primarily to our reported ebitda performance and margins in my remarks so on a constant currency basis first quarter revenues were up  the financial  risk and the legal businesses were both up  and tax  accountings growth rebounded to  adjusted ebitda was up  with the margin up over  basis points to over  driven by better operating performance in each business and lower corporate costs some of which was timing related nevertheless this represents the highest quarterly ebitda margin we have ever achieved and it is a strong start for the year now corporate costs decreased significantly on the yearonyear basis for three primary reasons first we worked hard to reduce center costs last year following the sale of our ip  science business second we made some adjustments to our locations these adjustments have no impact on our consolidated results but at a high level they will reduce our corporate costs and there will be a commensurate increase in costs allocated to our tax  accounting business in  and finally the first quarter results benefited from some timing factors which we expect will be reversed over the balance of the year as such our first quarter corporate cost should represent a low watermark for the year now for the full year we expect that corporate costs inclusive of depreciation and amortization expense will be approximately  million which would represent a reduction of about  million from last year and as we discussed during the last earnings call about half of that  million reduction consists of real savings achieved following the divestiture of our ip  science business whereas the other half is due to the reallocation of various corporate cost as i discussed earlier primarily to our tax  accounting business now let me provide some additional color on the performance of our individual segments starting with legal overall legal revenues were up  subscription revenues which makes up threequarters of the business were up  transactions  of the total were down  and us print which makes up the balance was down  from a margin perspective legals revenue growth and effective expense management led to a  basis points margin improvement versus the prioryear period now heres a more detailed look at the revenue performance of the three main subsegments in our legal business during the first quarter us online legal information which represented  of total revenues in the first quarter was up  we are now in the third consecutive year of positive growth for this subsegment this provides a solid foundation for legal given this segments high margins and strong free cash flow characteristics us print comprised  of total revenues and was down  and our solution businesses made up  of revenues and grew  recurring revenues which comprise the vast majority of revenues in that segment increased  while transaction revenues continued to be a drag and were down  in the first quarter now while transaction revenues are by definition pretty hard to predict we do expect that the yearonyear comparison will become a little easier in the second half of the year let me now turn to our tax  accounting business in the first quarter revenues grew  recurring revenues which are  of the total were up  and transaction revenues which is the remaining  increased by  ebitda was up a healthy  with the margin up over  basis points versus the prioryear period to  that strong ebitda performance was driven by revenue flow through coupled with the savings related to the charge we took in q  tight expense management and also the absence of  million of severance cost that we took in the first quarter of last year and that made the yearoveryear comparison a bit easier but even if you exclude this  million of severance cost the ebitda margin would still have been up by a healthy  basis points we do expect the margin to be a little lower in q and q than in the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the tax  accountings revenues and largely fixed cost base now turning to tax  accountings results by subsegment our professional business delivered another very strong quarter posting revenue growth of  the corporate segment grew  knowledge solutions was down  and the smaller government segments revenue declined by about  million on a yearoveryear basis now turning to our financial  risk business first quarter revenues were up  continuing the trend of the previous two quarters growth continued to be dampened by commercial pricing adjustments on our remaining legacy foreign exchange products and as we have said previously and as jim just reminded you the overall impact is diminishing and we expect these pricing adjustments to be largely completed in the first half of  growth was also affected by lower recoveries revenues on a fullyear basis we still expect recoveries to be only marginally down compared to  so overall excluding acquisitions which contributed about  to the growth rate financial  risks organic revenue growth rate during the first quarter was about  before recoveries and pricing adjustments we expect a more modest impact from these headwinds in q and no further impact in the second half of the year turning to q profitability metrics ebitda increased  to  million resulting in a margin of  up  basis points from a year ago this strong performance was primarily driven by improved revenue flowthrough and by the actions we took in the fourth quarter of last year looking at the financial  risk revenue in a bit more detail you can see on this next slide that desktoprelated revenue represented  of total revenues and declined  during the first quarter and excluding the pricing adjustments desktop revenues were down  the balance of our recurring revenue base is comprised of elektron data platform which we used to refer to as our feeds business and risk and in aggregate revenues were up  in this segment in the first quarter recoveries made up  of the total and were down  and finally transaction revenues were up  during the quarter foreign exchange volumes continued to be challenging but this was more than offset by a strong performance in tradeweb now let me update you on our earnings per share and free cash flow performance and i will start with earnings per share for the first quarter adjusted eps increased by  to  per share which was a  increase compared to the prioryear period and as you can see on this slide that improvement was primarily driven by stronger operating results across the board as the socalled belowtheline items did not have a material impact on eps in aggregate and finally currency had no impact on eps during the quarter looking for the full year however and assuming that exchange rates remain roughly where they are today we believe that currency could have a  to  negative impact on eps and in addition the recent acquisitions weve made could also have a  to  diluted impact on eps now the timing factors i referred to earlier in our corporate expenses represented a benefit of about  million in aggregate and they contributed about  to the yearoveryear increase in earnings per share this next slide reflects our free cash flow performance as you will recall there are several items impinging on free cash flow in  with the majority of the impacts being felt in the first quarter so working from the bottom of this slide upwards you can see that our reported free cash flow was negative  million during the first quarter versus a positive performance of  million in the prioryear period now our prioryear period benefited from the inclusion of our ip  science business which we sold last october and the yearoveryear variance related to that disposal was just over  million in addition there were two other significant factors impacting the first quarter first as indicated in our last earnings call we made a  million cash contribution to our pension plan in january this contribution brought the funded status of the plan to over  and we expect that it will eliminate the need for any further material contribution in the nearterm second we incurred  million of cash payments related to the severance charges that we took in the fourth quarter of  so the aggregate impact of these three factors that i just described was about  million negative excluding these items our free cash flow on a comparable basis would have been  million in  versus  million for the prioryear period with the variance being driven primarily by working capital timing items on a fullyear basis we continue to expect free cash flow to range between  million and  billion and since the pension contribution and the cash impact of the charge are clearly temporary we do expect to return to a stronger free cash flow performance in  so in conclusion we are reaffirming our  outlook overall we are pleased with the improving revenue trends record profitability and record eps performance we achieved in the quarter and as we look to the balance of the year accelerating revenue growth remains our number one priority as jim just discussed and we expect revenue growth to continue to improve as we progress throughout the year now given the largely subscription nature of our business the improvement will be gradual but it is reassuring to see that our recent actions are beginning to flow through into our financial results with that let me turn the call back over to frank so that we can take some of your questions frank j golden  thomson reuters corp terrific stephane thanks very much and that concludes our formal remarks so wed now like to open the call for questions so can we have the first question please operator questionandanswer session operator yes thank you we will go to vince valentini with td securities go ahead please vince valentini  td securities yeah thanks very much hopefully i can get a clarification and then a question just stephane to clarify if its  million for the full year in corporate costs and you did  million in q the quarterly base should have been  million so that would have meant  million of sort of onetime benefits i think you cited  million later in your remarks is that correct its actually  million not  million that you got a boost from stephane bello  thomson reuters corp i think its somewhere between  million and  million vince but your math is generally correct so corporate costs are decreasing from  million to  million and i explained the factors that drive this decrease if you take  million in q you should expect a run rate for corporate cost of somewhere between  million and  million for the balance of the year each quarter vince valentini  td securities okay and a broader question the net sales being down in the americas seems certainly counter to the employment trends weve seen and the better results youve had there than your other geographies recently can you peel that onion back a little bit more for us if you maybe exclude the commercial pricing adjustments on these fx migrations to eikon would the net sales in the americas have been positive and maybe you can talk more generally jim about the conversation youre having with clients in that region and whether theres increasing optimism or a bit of a pause for reflection james c smith  thomson reuters corp yeah sure and i would welcome the opportunity to peel the onion on that a little bit more this is purely driven by – in march of last year we announced the end of life for the old thomson one products so weve been migrating over the past year our clients from  thomson one products on to the new modern platform and obviously anytime you have a product migration like that the people who are eager for the new product sign up first those who are more ambivalent are towards the middle of the pack and the tough slogging is toward the end and so we always anticipated that we would have a difficult sales period as we migrated our clients from the legacy products on to the new products and that has indeed been the case with the brunt of that coming in q a little more in q but we will be completely through that migration in the first half of this year if you take that out were quite encouraged with what were hearing in the americas and with the opportunities that we have in the americas and what were hearing back from clients so a temporary hit to net sales because of cancelations of some old legacy products that we were no longer going to continue are more than offset by the opportunity to move the new clients or to move clients on to the new modern reliable robust platform our ease in operating that platform the reliability the security that our clients get and were particularly encouraged because in almost  of the cases where we moved an asset management client on to the new platform weve had the ability to upsell another product as well so this is just the natural transition of that move in the asset management space away from the legacy thomson one products to the new platform vince valentini  td securities thanks operator thank you our next question is from manav patnaik with barclays go ahead please manav patnaik  barclays capital inc yes thank you good morning gentlemen so just a followup on that a bit i guess based on your commentary of less headwinds in the second quarter and not in the second half is that  like normalized organic growth rate that you guys should report going forward and then i think your commentary was down to people being optimistic and signing up to the new fx platform but just broadly in the industry i mean it feels like at least the buy side has joined the trend of feeling the pain can you maybe give some comments there and how thats impacting your business james c smith  thomson reuters corp sure manav let me try to take the first part of your question weve been giving you what the underlying organic growth rate for financial business is if you exclude these two headwinds and its been about  i mean this is what we should be getting from just the annual pricing increase that we get and that happens pretty naturally in the financial business for us so thats  to  and then the total growth rate of the business is supplemented by whatever volume increase we could see and thats really driven by net sales as we said in the past and obviously also by the transaction revenue dynamics which obviously changes from one quarter to the other but we have had now a number of quarters where if you exclude these headwinds which we know will disappear you can see them like going down in q and then disappearing in the second half of the year we know what the underlying growth rate of the business is so thats why we feel pretty confident that the evolution of the growth rate of the financial business this year if you exclude transactions what it should look like given the impact of these headwinds so were very pleased that were nearing the end of these headwinds its really around the corner stephane bello  thomson reuters corp if you want to say something about the foreign exchange please go ahead james c smith  thomson reuters corp i think the foreign exchange what weve seen is that the strategy that weve pursued has enabled us to actually see a slight increase in the number of users of our foreign exchange platform this had been showing some declines in headwinds over the prior years weve been able to stabilize that and now were starting to see an increase of usage and users on the foreign exchange platforms which obviously is very comforting also for us manav patnaik  barclays capital inc got it and just my follow up to that was just if you could make some comments on outside if its guarded generally like all the pain that the buy side and sell side continuously face how thats impacting maybe not just fr but may be legal as well it sounds like tax is the only one that had good trends going for it stephane bello  thomson reuters corp im not sure i understand your question manav sorry manav patnaik  barclays capital inc so just in terms of the head count reduction and so forth like you guys arent seeing any of that impact to your businesses james c smith  thomson reuters corp if i might manav jim here look i think i mean obviously there are many different parts to our business and even your question specifically around the fx market there are many sectors in the fx market whether thats the sellside banks whether its brokerdealer network whether its treasury its a dealer to end customer and we are seeing certainly certain sectors of that market under more pressure than other pressure and i would say that generally where we have head countdependent businesses we continue to see more pressure and the encouraging thing for us i think in q was in the faster growing part of the business and a marketplace that is still growing so if you look at market data in general in financial services it is still continuing to grow and you look at our elektron data platform business and our risk business which are far less head countdependent those grew  in the first quarter –  for each in the first quarter and so those are still growing healthily so i think you have to kind of peel apart the onion on that one as well but certainly headwinds have not completely diminished i wouldnt want to ever give that impression but there are many aspects to the business and some of them are doing quite well now manav patnaik  barclays capital inc okay thanks a lot guys operator thank you our next question is from paul steep with scotia capital go ahead please paul steep  scotia capital inc great morning jim maybe you can talk a little bit about the growth businesses particularly risk as well as the elektron data those are the two you highlighted i guess last quarter and again this quarter maybe give us perspective as how large those are within the whole and then maybe what the addressable market opportunity looks like relative to the head count challenges weve talked about seemingly forever james c smith  thomson reuters corp sure if you look for the quarter across the – and there was consistent growth the kind of the low watermark would have been  and the high would have been  but they are all been growing nicely for us this year and have kind of seen an acceleration there you put all of those together thats now over  billion of the revenue base thats in that zone growing overall at  and the components of that are pretty evenly spread the large part would be the elektron data platform right now but the others are coming on and three of those four segments are now over  billion in revenue in their own right so were quite encouraged by them and they are less frankly head count dependent in all cases and theyre right in the heart of the world thats changing so fast right now when you think about the geopolitical uncertainty and you think about the regulatory changes that are afoot we think that bodes quite well for these businesses because when things change thats the time our customers turn to companies like us for the trusted answers that they need to navigate those changes so were encouraged that those trends can indeed continue paul steep  scotia capital inc all right ill change my followup really fast james c smith  thomson reuters corp okay paul steep  scotia capital inc because you got me intrigued if were growing at this pace theres one argument that would say youve done two tuckunders in clarient and avox in the most recent quarter is there a sense having transformed the business to where youre at today a willingness to step up to a larger transaction a  millionplus type deal that would further accelerate one of those areas wheres sort of the appetite for that at the moment thanks james c smith  thomson reuters corp our strategy and our appetite for acquisition hasnt changed from where its been for the last three or four years were still primarily focused on driving our business by driving organic growth by improving the quality of our products by improving our customer service and we always have our eyes open particularly for those tactical acquisitions that we can fold into our business that can support our growth initiatives by bringing in capabilities that we might not have by plugging a gap in our product offering by bringing a customer set with them perhaps a little more quickly than we could do with if we were to build and to do that organically but were very much looking for the kind of the tactical foldin opportunities while always keeping our eyes open for opportunities out there and as you know everyone talks about everything all the time so were certainly not sitting in a cave and not aware of whats happening in the competitive landscape or the ma landscape generally but our focus is on driving the business we have and if we see opportunities to improve that with tactical acquisitions that support what were already building then i think youll see us continue to do that but we have made a couple of relatively small acquisitions in recent months and our plan this year is to invest behind those to integrate those into our offerings and to continue to build them to scale paul steep  scotia capital inc ill slide in one quick clarification stephane in tax  accounting you didnt talk about weve had some challenged government projects in the us i guess for a lack of a better word in the last few quarters whats the progress in that i know it didnt matter on the top line but it was more a margin drag thanks guys stephane bello  thomson reuters corp it wasnt and look were making progress on these there was no impact or no meaningful impact as you could see from our results in the quarter we still have work to do and well continue to make good progress the team is continuing to make good progress on addressing the issues we had last year so as we said in the q earnings call i think we do expect a continuing level of spending to be reflected in our numbers throughout this year and actually there was fair bit of spending in q but we hope that youre not going to see the volatility from one quarter to the other that we saw last year because we obviously had to take some actions with regard to the assets we had on our balance sheet in the course of  so continued progress paul steep  scotia capital inc thank you operator thank you well go next to andrew steinerman with jpmorgan go ahead please andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan securities llc hi its andrew i have two questions the first one is about the  i know thats before currency as clearly labeled on slide  but does that include any small dilution on eps that might come from the recent acquisitions earlier this year thats my first question and my second question is a bigger question jim its about the strong margins in the first quarter and given that strong margins start have you changed the amount of innovation spending for thomson in terms of planning for innovation spending this year james c smith  thomson reuters corp can i answer the last one first andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan securities llc yes of course james c smith  thomson reuters corp the answer is no james c smith  thomson reuters corp ill answer the last one first and say no in fact i think were doing a much better job of reallocating capital spend within the business but if you look behind those big four growth initiatives i talk about theyre getting substantially more funding this year than they got in the prior year so we feel quite comfortable with that thats not a result of cutting back thats a result – its interesting in our model as you well know high fixed cost basis as revenue starts to improve you get lots of great flowthrough dynamics so its encouraging to see that even at low rates of overall revenue growth its good to see that powering some flow through to the bottom line and then the simplification initiatives that we took in q last year have stuck and those costs have come out but to be honest with you we would have taken them out regardless of the cost impact of those actions simply because they allow us to simplify the organization and become more nimble so its not the result of overcutting on investment spend andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan securities llc right but how about if margins continue to trend favorably would you step up your innovation spending this year or is it more a matter of we have our annual plan for innovation spending its already in there james c smith  thomson reuters corp no look i think its the great tradeoff that we make all the time and we will make that dynamically its a nice problem that i would love to have but we continually look at the transformation savings we were able to generate and then we allocate the size how much of that do we take to the bottom line and how much of that could we reallocate towards innovations spend that we dont have or towards speeding up a product to market or fixing of services and i think stephane has alluded to in a number of our calls if you look at the totality of our transformation savings they are well in excess of what weve taken to the bottom line and just each and every year and dynamically throughout the year as we see opportunity we try to fund that opportunity so theres not a hard and fast rule for how it works but were evaluating what we do with every dime that comes through the door and trying to apply it appropriately and i would hope that if we could continue to get more effective and efficient in how were managing the business that there will be lots of folks here knocking at the door to speed up things that would power the top line i have always said since the day i became a ceo i would trade a point of margin for a point of growth any day and i still believe that andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan securities llc well said thank you stephane bello  thomson reuters corp and andrew your first question i think was on the  eps target that we have and look the way we provide guidance for the year usually is before the impact of acquisitions and before currency the  i would say – you heard me in the remarks right we do expect currency may have a slightly negative impact over the course of the year and acquisitions exactly building on the point that jim just made we are actually investing behind the acquisition that weve made so we do expect some investments which should be dilutive to eps particularly in the kyc acquisition that weve made because we feel pretty strongly about the opportunity there and so were putting dollars behind them this being said to the extent that the impacts are pretty minor both currency and acquisitions we are very hopeful we can overcome them and achieve our  target andrew charles steinerman  jpmorgan securities llc got it thank you operator thank you our next question is from drew mcreynolds with rbc please go ahead drew mcreynolds  rbc dominion securities inc thanks very much just a clarification and then a question on fr stephane just on the  million in corporate cost guidance for  that has some depreciationamortization in it but were now focused on ebitda not ebit can you give us what that adjusted ebitda corporate line would be stephane bello  thomson reuters corp i can if you give me two seconds why dont you ask your second question ill give you the numbers by that time drew mcreynolds  rbc dominion securities inc no okay thank you and just on fr maybe for jim or stephane kind of look through that so you did i think flat organic in q and youve done kind of plus  the back half of last year and you did kind of flat with transactions up this quarter so im just wondering kind of within the mix what kind of took that sequential step back and then as we look at flowing through these buyside migrations that youre doing thats impacting net sales what kind of revenue flowthrough on a reported basis impact would that have thank you james c smith  thomson reuters corp stephane youre probably better positioned to answer that one stephane bello  thomson reuters corp well i was looking for the number sorry repeat if you dont mind i apologize for this if you could repeat your question drew mcreynolds  rbc dominion securities inc yeah stephane bello  thomson reuters corp if you could repeat your question james c smith  thomson reuters corp yeah drew mcreynolds  rbc dominion securities inc yeah the second question you want me to repeat james c smith  thomson reuters corp yeah drew mcreynolds  rbc dominion securities inc yeah so just – and we kind of do the other one offline if you want but im just trying to better understand kind of the puts and takes within fr if you exclude the acquisition it was flat organic this q you did i think plus  in q and q of last year so im just wondering kind of what took a step back and then in addition to that when we look at the net sales impact of that thomson migration for kind of this quarter and next quarter thats going to have an ultimate kind of reported flowthrough revenue impact after that and im just wondering is that a significant kind of impact in reported revenue organic revenue in the back half of this year and into  stephane bello  thomson reuters corp look i would say directionally we would expect more – the difference between reported and organic revenue to be about the same for the balance of the year so acquisitions – assuming no additional acquisitions for fr over the balance of the year we will contribute about  basis points also to the top line performance of our fr business in terms of your other question im not sure exactly what drove the numbers i think its probably rounding more than anything else that may have driven the organic from like the reported organic growth rate from  to  flat this quarter as i said i think that directionally what we expect to see in that business is an improvement in the growth rate thats driven by the gradual elimination of these headwinds and obviously whats going to have an impact also is the evolution of our net sales performance over the balance of the year and as jim said in that respect being positive in q in the face of having to go through the final phase of our migration for the asset management business was a very good performance in our perspective so that was encouraging and in answer to your other question i believe that the equivalent number for the corporate expense is about – i think depreciation amortization is about  million also in that segment so deduct the  million from the  million yeah about  million of that given and you should see what – its about  million or so thereabout that we would expect on an ebitda line drew mcreynolds  rbc dominion securities inc okay perfect thank you stephane operator thank you and our next question will come from andre benjamin with goldman sachs please go ahead andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co thanks good morning as for my question i wanted to focus on the growth potential in the data feeds business where that could possibly go over the next couple of years versus the  you put out this quarter im wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about whats underpinning the strong growth how much of it is from customer shifting revenue from the desktop businesses versus new business with new customers james c smith  thomson reuters corp sure i think we saw – we have seen some external reports in the last couple of months or so about the underlying growth and the demand for market data so that demand is growing for market data and obviously more of it is being consumed by machines than people these days and thats whats driving the growth and yes i think there is a shift from desktops to feeds that will continue to drive the growth with the aggregate markets going up but were seeing it frankly across the face of that business whether its with the realtime data feeds some of the referential pricing data thats there and for our risk products so i think its consistent across the board it continues to grow with many of our existing customers and we continue to add clients particularly on the buy side andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co i guess that kind of feeds my followup which is to the degree you can just at least give us a ballpark kind of what the revenue mix is for that business between sellside banks and the buyside clients james c smith  thomson reuters corp on that one we have to get back to you i dont have it off hand andre benjamin  goldman sachs  co okay thank you james c smith  thomson reuters corp well get to you on this operator thank you our next question is from aravinda galappatthige with canaccord genuity go ahead please aravinda galappatthige  canaccord genuity corp good morning thanks for taking my question jim i was wondering if you can sort of revisit sort of the cost rationalization opportunities ahead of you again obviously we saw sort of a big block in q and thats playing out now as you look at the main pieces that are in front of you how do you see that sort of play out over the next year or two do you feel that it would be chunky as it has been in the past or would it be smaller restructuring programs on a goforward basis thanks james c smith  thomson reuters corp sure we have our transformation machine really firing on all cylinders right now so i do anticipate sitting here today that its going to be a steady machine that goes after the cost base that continues to find ways to work more effectively and more efficiently to consolidate technology platforms whenever possible reducing our overall real estate footprint now particularly to help with simplifying our customer experience help us become more productive in our sales and marketing activities and our client acquisitions and onboarding and customer support so i think the machine will continue to find ways to streamline our operations and make them better while reducing costs and i think thatll be steady its built into the run rate of the business we wouldnt call those out and ive been asked before where are you i honestly believe we are still in the lateearly innings to middle innings if i can use the baseball analogy of that journey so we have lots of opportunity to keep getting better and then well go back to andrews question earlier well make the decision of how much of that we invest to fire the top line and how much of that we take to the bottom line but as ive always said as we move through that exercise and as we make steady progress toward our goals if we see an opportunity to take a step change that will pay back in short order like the charge we took at the end of last year which will pay for itself in one year we will step up and take those and well call it out well tell you what were going to do well tell you the savings that we expect to get from it and we wont shy away from that if the opportunity presents itself sitting here today we dont have any such plans nor do we see any on the horizon we expect it would be steady state continued improved execution aravinda galappatthige  canaccord genuity corp great thats helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from david chu with bank of america please go ahead david j chu  bank of america merrill lynch good morning thanks so can we dive into net sales for a bit so how did gross sales look in the quarter and if maybe you can speak to retention and just kind of how that compares to recent quarters please stephane bello  thomson reuters corp sure i would say at a high level gross sales improved overall and they also improved i would say across the businesses retention rate was down a little in the quarter and thats very much driven by the factor weve been talking about on this call which is end of life of our legacy product in the asset management business and that essentially translates in a higher level of cancellation as you would expect so we still expect a little bit more cancellation in q probably not to the same extent as in the first quarter but still some impact and then hopefully we hope to see our retention rate start to rebound in the latter part of the year but good gross sales performance which was quite encouraging and retention down a little bit because really of that factor that i just described in our financial business david j chu  bank of america merrill lynch okay great and just lastly so in terms of fr has the buy side been much more stable than the sell side and maybe you can talk about the shift toward passive and the impact to your business stephane bello  thomson reuters corp for us the buy side has been growing overall as a segment and youve seen some of the slides we showed in the fourth quarter earnings release where youve seen how much of a percentage of revenue is now represented by buy side and its a much bigger proportion than it was four five years ago theres no question that the buy side is going to become more sensitive to head count the same way the sell side was also but i think what makes us pretty happy is that we do have now a much better product offering in the buy side the reaction the feedback has been very positive so we believe that we are better positioned to compete in that segment its going to remain a very very important segment for everyone for us and for our competitors of course and the last point i would say that buy side clients are starting to be more interested in the feeds business not just on the desktop business which is also something that we feel is a good trend from our perspective given how large and well positioned that business is david j chu  bank of america merrill lynch okay and lastly so continued shift toward passive is that a major impact to your business stephane bello  thomson reuters corp too soon to tell i would say at this point in time but in general that would lead to more reliance on feeds and less on desktops that would be my very preliminary read on what a trend like that might make david j chu  bank of america merrill lynch okay thank you very much operator thank you well go next to peter appert with piper jaffray please go ahead peter p appert  piper jaffray  co thank you good morning so a question on guidance given the strength you saw in the first quarter the easing headwinds youve cited and your expectation of accelerating growth im just wondering why youre not a bit more optimistic here in terms of the fullyear numbers what are the offsets in the later part of the year that might cause the numbers not to be better stephane bello  thomson reuters corp well peter i would answer that question very simply its still very early in the year thats really i would say the main reason obviously the performance in the first quarter gives us increased confidence that we can meet the guidance that weve given out but its probably a bit early to think about changing anything at this point peter p appert  piper jaffray  co so not a specific expectation that there i mean there were some unusual items that boosted the margin obviously in the first quarter but this is not a sort of backdoor expectation that therell be some incremental pressures for the balance of the year stephane bello  thomson reuters corp no i mentioned some of potential offsets in my remarks right obviously currency if they stay where they are may have a little bit of a negative impact on the earnings per share performance we saw no impact in q but that impact can increase based on where its moved were making investments in these acquisitions that weve made so the acquisition weve made will be a bit diluted nothing major and actually in the case of the acquisitions its probably good reasons to have these negative offsets because they really represent investments in future growth but really nothing too major peter p appert  piper jaffray  co thank you operator thank you our next question is from ato garrett with deutsche bank please go ahead ato garrett  deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions first looking at expectations for financial  risk and the improving revenue outlook across the year that you previously mentioned can you just talk about the moving parts there i know youve called out the diminishing recovery declines and the smaller impact from pricing adjustments but just want to get your expectations of the underlying business stephane bello  thomson reuters corp the underlying business will be – look weve had like a number of quarters now where the underlying growth rate in the business was  the growth trends in that business will be defined by the evolution of net sales over the course of the year and obviously by transactions also i mean look the change in revenue mix the fact that you saw in the first quarter i think it was the very first time that we had the feeds and risk business being actually bigger as a percentage of the total revenue base than the desktop revenue base that should be positive also so i would say this very gradual change in revenue mix hopefully will be beneficial for the revenue rate of the financial business overall ato garrett  deutsche bank securities inc great and just again final one to follow up just regarding the legal business finally moving away from fr a bit given some of the trends the volatility youve been seeing around the transactional revenues and declining revenues from us print which now are very high margin can you just remind us or can you help us frame up how we should be thinking about legal margins for the year stephane bello  thomson reuters corp yes no change from what we said in prior calls on that question ato the trick in the legal business is to ride the shifting revenue mix as solutions revenues get a bigger proportion of the total they have lower margins the margin is increasing in this business but theyre a lower margin business in aggregate than the online solution business but for the full year i think we would expect the margin to be – if we can keep the margin roughly flat for the full year in the business its a very good performance and thats going to be achieved through mix so as i said the margin in our solution business is getting better number one and number two continuing tight management of expenses so the goal there is to gradually get the revenue moving while the margin is not negatively impacting because of the negative mix effect james c smith  thomson reuters corp and if i could just add to that im glad you asked about the legal business because we are highly encouraged to see those underlying subscription businesses and legal growing at  because those are very sticky very profitable businesses for us and will contribute to the stability and growth of that business as well ato garrett  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks frank j golden  thomson reuters corp operator wed like to take one final question please operator thank you and the final question will come from doug arthur with huber research go ahead please douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc yeah thanks i got a couple of questions but ill take a few offline stephane in terms of the charge you took for severance in the fourth quarter i think it was  million is there any way to sort of quantify what the benefit of that severance was in q and i assume it will have some legs for the rest of the year thanks stephane bello  thomson reuters corp i dont know how to quantify it very precisely you saw clearly like the yearoveryear margin improvement was pretty meaningful so a lot of that was attributable obviously to the actions we took in the fourth quarter and yes it should have like over the balance of the year as jim said this is a charge which has a pretty rapid payback so it definitely pays for itself in the scope of  months without any question james c smith  thomson reuters corp and i would just add that the charge as well in addition to the financial impact that that move had it has greatly simplified operations within the organization and as ive said before its a move that was justified on that alone douglas middleton arthur  huber research partners llc okay great thank you frank j golden  thomson reuters corp okay thatll be our final question and wed like to thank you all for joining us for this first quarter earnings recap operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this conference will be available for replay

in the country slack on tuesday unveiled a new product designed for big companies such as international business machines corp capital one financial corp and paypal holdings inc the slack enterprise grid is set up for companies with hundreds of thousands of employees and strict compliance requirements the development marks a striking evolution for a fouryearold messaging platform that started out as a tool used by a handful of entrepreneurs and was quickly adopted by media companies and startups slack is a platform where employees can send messages collaborate organize and share files the technology also integrates with a wide variety of business software  such as salesforcecom inc and skype  so employees can do all their work within slack the technology had been designed for teams or small groups of employees but with additional security and regulatory approvals slack can sell its enterprise product to big financial and health care companies said noah weiss who heads slacks search learning and intelligence group ibm capital one and paypal have been using it for months andrew braccia a partner at accel partners who provided slacks first venture investment said slacks bigbusiness

by spiceworks a network of it professionals found that microsoft teams will surpass slack in popularity among businesses about  percent of large businesses are already using or plan to use teams

reuters estimates an earnings estimates product and reuters aftermarket embargoed research database an analyst research distribution product the proposed settlement further requires the licensing of related intellectual property access to personnel and transitional support to ensure that the buyer of each set of data can continue to update its database so as to continue to offer users a viable and competitive product the european commission imposed similar divestments according to the commissions press release the parties committed to divest the databases containing the content sets of such financial information products together with relevant assets personnel and customer base as appropriate to allow purchasers of the databases and assets to quickly establish themselves as a credible

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
