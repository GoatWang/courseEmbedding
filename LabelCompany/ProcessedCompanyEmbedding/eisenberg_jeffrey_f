hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses last year despite the companys flagship daytrana adhd patch being mired in two product recalls noven has had a rough couple of years the fda identified manufacturing problems with daytrana back in  and they still arent fixed consumers had difficulty peeling the backs off the patches properly with the result that twice in  the company had to recall its products novens revenues and net income both went up although the latter just  million was reduced by a  million charge the company had to pay its sales partner shire for screwing up the daytrana patches and the company warned in its k that it might not have seen the end of its recalls  we expect the peel force issue to continue to negatively affect margins how did this amateurhour performance affect the compensation of novens top execs they all got cash bonuses although the total compensation of the companys top execs stayed roughly the same their cash and perks  ks life insurance airline
