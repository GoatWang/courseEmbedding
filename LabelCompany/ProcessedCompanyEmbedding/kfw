requirements and conditions in the respective partner country the funding model opted for depends on the size of a countrys debt its economic output and level of development the performance capacity of the project partner as well as the type of project the funding models include pure grants and loans from budget funds but also loans that combine budget funds and kfws own funds the conditions for these kinds of loans are particularly favourable interest term kfw also grants loans which are only comprised of kfws own funds at terms and conditions commensurate to risk grants under german financial cooperation grants funded from the german federal governments budget are mainly allocated to poor and poorly developed countries the funds are not repaid however to be eligible to receive this funding development policy criteria must be met including the partner countrys ownership and commitment we mainly deploy grants and very lowinterest standard loans in poor and poorly developed countries in    of the german federal governments budget funds were dedicated to subsaharan africa more developed countries are also eligible for grants for projects that contribute directly to reducing poverty or to protecting global public goods such as e g tropical rainforests development loans in the case of development loans kfw combines budget funds of the german federal government with own funds that it raises at favourable terms on the capital market when our own funds are used partner countries benefit from the cheap refinancing options available to kfw thanks to its aaa rating and a partial risk assumption by the german federal government the development loans were created in collaboration with the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development bmz to increase the funding volume for the projects and programmes in the partner countries the terms and conditions are structured to ensure that the projects are able to bear the costs and that the loans comply with the international agreements for official development assistance oda even though the terms of the development loans are higher than pure budget funds they are significantly below market leveldevelopment loans are generally structured as reducedinterest loans only kfws own funds which are partially secured by a guarantee line from the german federal government are deployed for the loans we then lower the loan interest rates with grants from budget funds the result is that the projects can be financed for the partners and the loans meet the oda criteria for public development cooperation promotional loans promotional loans are loans to partners in developing countries and emerging economies commissioned by the government that are   funded by kfw on the capital market the loans are deployed for projects that are effective when it comes to development policy and viable in economic terms for which however funding is not available from the commercial banking sector e g due to long financing terms requiredthe fc promotional loans aim to fill the gap between fc development loans and commercial bank loans and give german financial cooperation more flexible options for
