to positively affect millions of patients who are underserved by current therapeutic alternatives the core technology behind our platform was developed at and licensed from the massachusetts institute of technology harvard university whitehead institute for biomedical research and massachusetts general hospital our humandriven immunoprofiling platform enables us to extensively interrogate the human

patientspecific diseasespecific manner harnessing the power of human™ our platform provides a basis for developing bestinclass product candidates from a fundamental understanding of how immunotherapies work in each patient our vision then is to use this humanderived knowledge to better predict which antibody drug candidates are most likely to be effective in a targeted group of patients with the goals of reducing side effects and accelerating the drug discovery process our discoveries will not only be valuable for the development of therapeutic antibodies but also as potential diagnostic products initially we are building a pipeline of immunomodulators that target checkpoint proteins which the body use to prevent runaway immune responses that can prove debilitating or even deadly our near term goals include preclinical testing for our internal pipeline programs in our humandriven platform as well as in other preclinical models we are leveraging the breadth of our technology through strategic collaborations to date we have engaged in several proofofconcept collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical companies through them our technology
