the walsh administration by mark arsenault and andrew ryan globe staff  january   two years ago sean t o’donovan was a nobody at boston city hall a former somerville alderman and a lawyer handling personal injury and drunkendriving cases from a modest office in ball squarebut with martin j walsh’s election as mayor o’donovan gained powerful new connections in government center not only has he known walsh for  years but o’donovan’s childhood buddy high school classmate and former longtime law partner eugene l o’flaherty became the city’s top lawyer advertisement under the new administration o’donovan has emerged as an influential player and a product salesman in boston city hall enjoying direct access to top officials according to hundreds of emails between o’donovan and city employees which were obtained by the globe through a records request and offer a breathtaking howto guide for leveraging political relationshipso’donovan’s clients with business before the city include the dabbah family of switzerland whose development company is proposing a luxury condo tower overlooking boston common he’s handling business before the boston licensing board for a restaurant conglomerate shepherding clients through the mayor’s office of consumer affairs and licensing and arguing for relief from the zoning board of appeal for builders and developers get fast forward in

selling industrial cleaning products to the city by the barrel he’s pushing solarpowered garbage cans to the top echelon of the public works department his pitch to city officials for an “amazing” product that “will forever solve each and every pothole” reads like a latenight infomercial dina rudickglobe staff mayor marty walsh o’flaherty to leave house join walsh at city hall and along the way he has found time to tap political contacts for his family lobbying the mayor’s office for help securing his nephew a recommendation to the us naval academywalsh and o’flaherty say o’donovan is getting no special privileges but email traffic suggests administration officials have been accommodating — even chummy — toward o’donovan readily accepting meetings he proposes and helping him network with other city employees who might be able to benefit him advertisement “anything for an o’donovan” interim public works commissioner michael dennehy wrote to o’donovan in people who work in boston’s real estate and lobbying worlds say o’donovan appeared as if from nowhere to become one of the new goto guys for companies that need something from city governmentbefore walsh took over there is little record of o’donovan in city hall email traffic he had no email contact with the boston redevelopment authority in the two years prior to walsh talking office on jan   the agency said city departments during those years included o’donovan on just two impersonal “mass emails” walsh’s office saidsince the start of the new administration o’donovan has exchanged  emails with city departments and the bra officials say in response to globe public records requeststhe perception that city hall works better for the wellconnected is as old as municipal government and its drab concrete corridors remain fertile ground for lobbyists and lawyers with friends in high places o’donovan is just one very active example among the new faces leveraging influence in boston’s seat of governmentduring his  mayoral campaign walsh promised a new era of transparency at city hall vowing in his inaugural address to “set tough new ethics standards for my staff    with new rules against conflicts of interest”walsh in an interview defended his administration’s interactions with lobbyists saying he has no favorite sons in the influence industry and has cast nobody into political siberia — an accusation frequently lobbed against his predecessor thomas m menino ‘i’m not going to tell anyone they can’t represent somebody because they have a relationship’ “certainly we don’t favor any one particular person or dislike anyone else” he said “with a change of administration — you’ve got to figure the menino administration was here for  years — people got used to going to the same people over and over and over to get things done now there’s an opportunity for other people to get involved with the city”o’donovan is “doing business in the city of boston” walsh said “i don’t see a problem with that”“i’m not going to tell anyone they can’t represent somebody because they have a relationship that’s not fair but they’re not going to get any special privileges from me”o’donovan long a fixture in somerville as a year member of the board of aldermen has opened a second office more befitting a boston rainmaker in a stately redbrick building at  tremont st a chip shot from city hall plaza he did not respond to messages left by phone email text and in person at his officeso’flaherty the city’s corporation counsel said in an email that he has not helped o’donovan’s business “my personal friendships and relationships do not influence me or my professional work” he said jessica rinaldiglobe stafffile  the city’s top lawyer eugene l o’flaherty o’donovan’s emails with the bra have yet to be released to the globe but his emails with city departments show how o’donovan used his connections to win friendly introductions to key city officialsin may  five months into the new administration emails show o’donovan sought a favor from a friend — stephen passacantilli then a special assistant to walsh at city hall whom o’donovan had known for many years o’donovan had also represented him in an unrelated  court caseo’donovan wanted help pitching bioorganic catalyst a california cleaning product maker to dennehy the public works commissioner and to henry f vitale executive director of the water and sewer commission in an email to passacantilli o’donovan described one of the company’s products and inquired “can i ask you to forward this to mr denehy sic  mr vitale”subsequent emails suggest that o’donovan obtained an inperson meeting with top public works officials two days laterwithin a week o’donovan was writing dennehy directly and offering to drop off a free sample for the department to test“it sounds like a great product” dennehy wrote back and in another email “thanks sean we look forward to working with you”dennehy in an email to the globe said o’donovan got no special treatmentcity purchasing records show that the walsh administration has since spent about  on bioorganic catalyst productswith the public works department on board as a client o’donovan sought to expand sales within the city the emails indicatein july  michael brohel deputy commissioner of public works connected o’donovan via email with a city engineer to talk about cleaning products for use at spectacle island a cityowned former landfillthe next month o’donovan asked brohel if he could meet with the boston fire department about one of the company’s oilspill cleaners “not sure i will have time to join you in a bfd meeting” brohel responded “but let me see if i can find you a contact over there”in october  o’donovan credited dennehy and brohel for indirectly helping him make a sale to a private transfer station operator “thank you again because of our relationship with you this became possible” he wrote in another email he gushed “marty is lucky to have you lads”parker dale chairman of bioorganic catalyst said o’donovan has worked for the company as an independent sales representative for more than six years o’donovan’s recent
