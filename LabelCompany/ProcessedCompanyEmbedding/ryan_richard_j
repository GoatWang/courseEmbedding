the future richard branson just hinted that hes getting involved with the hyperloop the billionaire entrepreneur has his eye on futuristic transportation againbut this time its for here on earth by kevin j ryan kevin j ryan is a staff writer for inc he has written for espn the magazine and the long island press and contributed to mental floss he lives in queens new york whereskr staff writer incwhereskr write a comment sir richard branson credit getty images richard branson has long been working on revolutionizing the way people travel the skies now he might have similar aspirations for here on earth in an interview with british gq the virgin founder apparently hinted that hes interested in getting involved with the hyperloop the highspeed rail idea first proposed by elon musk in  hyperloop and virgintheres something on the horizon he told the publication according to the international business times the gq story is not yet online or on news stands here in the us branson has shown an interest in highspeed travel throughout his career he founded virgin airways in  as a more hip customerfriendly alternative to legacy airlines virgin galactic launched in  is intended to serve initially as a space tourism company but branson has said it could someday be used to transport people across the world at lightning speedsay from london to sydney in two and a half hours though its still likely years away from breaking any ground los angelesbased hyperloop one has made the most progress toward developing the necessary technology for the train which the company says would levitate above its rails and travel at speeds of up to  mph hyperloop one demonstrated a scaleddown version of its tech last year and has said it plans to show a larger scale version later this year the startup recently announced  finalists from among  submissions for proposed routes of which it says it will pursue three hyperloop transportation technologies another los angelesbased startup is working on similar technology though it has yet to show it off to the public that company announced a partnership with the south korean government this week to work on developing a working prototype its not clear whether branson plans to begin his own rival company or if hes looking to get involved with one of the existing companies when reached by inc through a company spokesperson hyperloop transportation technologies ceo dirk ahlborn would not confirm nor deny bransons potential involvement adding as the first company to begin making the hyperloop a reality back in  seeing the continued growth of this movement is amazing we look forward to collaborating with all the different players to accelerate this newborn industry hyperloop one declined to comment on whether it had spoken with branson about his potential involvement instead referring inc to virgin when contacted by inc a virgin company spokesperson said richard talks to lots of people and potential partners and  is active in the future of transportationbut in regards to hyperloop there is nothing to report if branson were to finance an existing project it could go a long way toward making the hyperloop a reality since most infrastructure projects are financed by public tax money they tend to be underfunded says taylor paquette of sb capitol solutions a washington dcbased government relations firm specializing in transportation and infrastructure lobbying there are private companies addressing infrastructure problems through mechanisms like tolling but this is unique in that it would be a highprofile person potentially trying to invest in infrastructure she says infrastructure is not sexy but if richard branson got involved it could be the catalyst necessary to develop the project and lead to other publicprivate partnerships in the infrastructure realm she says while hyperloop one currently has  million in funding and is seeking another  million the cost of a single hyperloop project would likely be much more than that documents leaked last year revealed that hyperloop one estimated the cost of a route in the bay area at  million per mile bringing a mile route to a total cost of around  billion of the  routes the company is currently considering four are in bransons native united kingdom including one that could make the mile trip from london to edinburgh in  minutes the finalists also include  routes in the us including paths connecting chicago with pittsburgh seattle with portland oregon and miami with orlando for his part musk isnt involved with any hyperloop company when he outlined his vision for the technology in  he revealed that he didnt plan on pursuing it himself in recent months though hes been involved with a new project a tunneldigging venture called the boring company musk said at a ted talk in april that underground tunnels would be a good fit with hyperloop technology last month hyperloop one chief counsel marvin ammori told inc that hyperloop one would welcome anyone innovating in driving down the cost of tunneling that would be a great benefit to us he said virgin trains bransons ukbased highspeed railway company operates trains out of london that travel at about  mph that company serves upwards of  million passengers per year published on jun   richard ryan  attorney in oak lawn il  lawyercom ask a lawyer tell us your case information for

has shown efficacy as adjunctive therapy for atopic dermatitis ad this feasibility study evaluated the clinical response and patient acceptability of treatment with a cleansing body wash containing sodium hypochlorite in children with ad this was a week openlabel feasibility study of  children with ad conducted in a pediatric dermatology outpatient clinic between may  and july  children with moderate to severe ad defined as an investigator global assessment iga score of at least  on a point scale who were age  months and older and had lesional cultures positive for staphylococcus aureus at baseline were included patients were instructed to wash  daysweek for  weeks with the sodium hypochlorite–containing cleansing body wash during the study period patients individualized topical and systemic treatment regimens were continued clinical response to treatment was measured using an iga score and the percentage of body surface area bsa affected parents were also administered a retrospective questionnaire evaluating acceptability of the product there was a statistically significant reduction in iga score at all time points with an overall mean reduction from baseline to final measurement using the last observation carried forward in all patients of  p   n   similarly the mean reduction of bsa affected was  p   n   parents reported that the body wash was significantly easier to use than traditional bleach baths p   the significant reductions in clinical disease severity scores with use of this formulation are encouragingenhanced pdfstandard pdf  kb atopic dermatitis ad is a chronic immunemediated disease of cutaneous inflammation and barrier dysfunction that affects approximately  to  of children worldwide   the effect of ad on a childs everyday psychological emotional and social functioning is considerable and alongside the cost of longterm treatment creates a significant social and economic burden  the marked susceptibility of individuals with ad to colonization and infection of the skin with staphylococcus aureus is thought to play a significant role in exacerbation and maintenance of the disease   s aureus is isolated from lesional skin in up to  of patients and a correlation exists between disease severity and bacterial load  superantigens that strains of s aureus colonizing ad skin produce inhibit the activity of t regulatory cells that normally suppress inflammation generating a state of resistance to topical corticosteroid therapy and triggering disease exacerbations  moreover with the alarming increase in the prevalence of multidrugresistant s aureus particularly methicillinresistant s aureus mrsa  alternative methods are being sought to reduce the frequency of oral antibiotic therapy to counteract the growing epidemic of antibiotic resistance in the general communityseveral other antiseptic formulations have been investigated for use in ad resistance rates of mrsa to topical antibiotic agents such as mupirocin and sodium fusidate are increasing rapidly   triclosan is a chlorinated aromatic compound with antibacterial and antifungal properties but reports of triclosan resistance and the possibility that this may contribute to antimicrobial resistance through crossresistance or coresistance mechanisms is of concern  chlorhexidine is an antiseptic that is bactericidal and bacteriostatic against grampositive and gramnegative bacteria with activity against fungi and enveloped viruses it has the significant disadvantage of being contraindicated for use near the eyes and ears because it has toxic effects on the cornea and can cause sensorineural deafness after direct instillation into the middle ear it may also cause significant skin irritationsodium hypochlorite has been used in clinical practice for more than  years for a multitude of infectious indications because of its bactericidal antiviral and sporicidal properties it has been widely accepted that the use of sodium hypochlorite does not lead to the development of antimicrobial resistance unlike other antiseptic preparations dilute sodium hypochlorite has been found to be nontoxic to tissues and mucosal surfaces in human and animal studies   many dermatologists now incorporate intermittent use of dilute sodium hypochlorite “bleach baths” as an adjunctive therapy for individuals with ad although one study showed a significant reduction in ad disease severity with this regime  controversy exists as to the interpretation of these results  the primary objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical response to treatment with a cleansing body wash containing sodium hypochlorite cln bodywash top md skin care inc dallas tx in patients with moderate to severe ad change in quantitative bacterial load from baseline tolerability of the product and patient adherence and satisfaction were examined as secondary endpointsmaterials and methodsthis was a week singlecenter openlabel partially retrospective partially prospective nonrandomized feasibility study of  children with ad conducted between may  and july  in dallas tx eleven of  patients had data collected retrospectively and the remaining  had data collected prospectively in a standardized manner at baseline and weeks   and  once the beneficial effects of this new topical regime became apparent the schulman associates institutional review board cincinnati ohio granted ethical approval irb number  a parent or guardian of each child gave informed written consent patients with moderate to severe ad defined as an investigator global assessment iga score of at least  on a point scale who were age  months or older and had positive s aureus lesional cultures at baseline were included in the study exclusion criteria included clinically active infections abscesses boils or purulent discharge and topical or systemic antibiotic use in the previous  weeks information on patient demographic characteristics and clinical disease severity including baseline iga score and percentage body surface area bsa affected were recorded one or two bacterial cultures were taken at baseline from the worst affected lesional sites of ad a positive s aureus culture was a prerequisite for entry to the studyindividuals who met the aforementioned criteria were instructed to wash  daysweek for  weeks using the sodium hypochlorite–containing cleansing body wash patients lathered with the body wash from the neck down and then rinsed it off after  to  minutes during the study period patients individualized topical and systemic treatment regimens were continued and any treatment modifications were recorded after the initial followup visit patients were given the option to advance to daily usage with the body wash if desired the same clinician recorded the iga score bsa affected and adverse events for each patient at all visits because the followup time points were not standardized in this exploratory study followup intervals were used to group data at weeks  to   to   to  and  to  repeat bacterial cultures were obtained from the same baseline culture site at each visit cultures were quantified at quest diagnostics and laboratory corporation of america dallas tx with bacterial load measured crudely   no growth   scant growth   mild growth   moderate growth   heavy growth when two cultures were taken the mean value was used for each patient after termination of the study parents were administered a retrospective questionnaire evaluating the acceptability and tolerability of the product the questionnaire addressed adverse effects such as skin irritation or burning ease of administration and overall satisfaction with the product for the  patients who had previous experience with traditional dilute sodium hypochlorite “bleach baths” similar questions including their preference of regimen were ascertainedresultsof the  patients screened to participate  were recruited to the study one of the screened patients showed no growth on initial culture and the other two required oral antibiotic therapy on the day of screening baseline characteristics are summarized in table

concluded as the product was rinsed off one did not experience an improvement in iga or bsa and withdrew from the study after  month and the other showed improvement in bsa affected but not iga and completed the study itching occurred in one patient this adverse event was present at  month but was no longer present at  months the patient showed an improvement in iga and bsa affected and completed the studydiscussionin accordance with previous studies this study supports the high rates of s aureus colonization in individuals with ad the use of this sodium hypochlorite gel cleanser resulted in statistically significant reductions in all clinical disease severity scores after  weeks with highly significant reductions from mean baseline measurements to the last observed clinical assessmentthe original traditional bleach bath study of  patients with moderate to severe ad compared the use of twiceweekly dilute sodium hypochlorite–containing baths half cup of  bleach to a full bath of water and nasal mupirocin ointment for  consecutive days once a month with normal baths and nasal vehicle alone for  months  both groups were pretreated with  weeks of oral cephalexin there was a significantly greater mean reduction in the eczema area and severity index easi in those treated with the dilute sodium hypochlorite–containing bath and nasal mupirocin combination than in placebotreated patients at  p   and  p   months for bathsubmerged sites similar reductions were seen in bsa and iga scores the study received criticism in a subsequent review because there was a considerable difference in baseline easi between the two treatment groups  in the treatment group vs  in the placebo group and it was not stated whether adjustment for baseline severity was performed raising the possibility of regression to the mean  additionally only  of the  patients in the treatment arm were followed up at  months the improvements in iga and bsa observed in the treatment arm were similar to those observed in our studywith a greater focus on the effect of ad on diseaserelated quality of life patientfriendly therapeutic interventions that minimize interference with daily living are actively being sought consistently high scores on the patient satisfaction questionnaire with patients unanimously citing a marked preference for this product over traditional dilute sodium hypochlorite bleach baths highlighted the acceptability and tolerability of this product the use of this acceptable and convenient formulation of sodium hypochlorite may result in greater patient adherence to decolonization regimensalthough a trend toward decreasing bacterial load was observed in our study a crude measure was used to quantify bacterial load the technique was not standardized and varying sites and numbers of cultures were taken for each patient as a result colonization rates could not be reliably assessed fortyfour percent of the patients with moderate to severe ad from north texas who enrolled in this study had a positive culture for mrsa which reflects a higher mrsa colonization rate in individuals with ad than reported in other studies   studies are currently under way to better determine the quantitative effect of body wash containing sodium hypochlorite on s aureus growth using a standard or modified scrub technique as described in the literature   this method will allow the determination of bacterial density by counting colony forming units on selective media and will use rna sequencing for bacterial identification and sensitivities  in the original bleach bath study the proportion of participants with positive s aureus cultures from the skin and nares was unchanged at  months despite dramatic clinical improvement suggesting that total elimination of s aureus may not be necessary to decrease eczema severity this was also suggested in a recent study that analyzed temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with ad  the proportion of s aureus was observed to be greater during disease flares with successful treatment linked to greater bacterial diversitythe antimicrobial effect of low molar ratios of sodium hypochlorite probably results from the irreversible aggregation of essential bacterial proteins  the safety of topical dilute sodium hypochlorite has been well established in human and animal studies   a study of the use of topical unbuffered sodium hypochlorite for the management of burn wound infections examined the optimum concentration of sodium hypochlorite with regard to safety and efficacy  minimum bactericidal concentrations were  for s aureus  for streptococcus pyogenes and  for pseudomonas aeruginosa allowing the authors to conclude that an optimal concentration of  would be suitable for the treatment of burn wound infections without causing tissue toxicity  in most recommended traditional bleach baths the concentration of sodium hypochlorite ranges from  parts per million ppm  equivalent to  cup of bleach in onehalf tub of water to  ppm  equivalent to a  cup of bleach in onehalf tub of water the concentration of sodium hypochlorite in the body wash used in the current study is   ppm similar to the traditional dilute bleach baths giving it optimal bactericidal activity against s aureus while demonstrating excellent tolerability in patients with impaired skin barrier functionas a pilot feasibility study many limitations of this trial preclude us from determining conclusively the clinical response to treatment with this novel sodium hypochlorite body wash in moderate to severe ad our study was nonblinded lacked a placebo arm and was conducted in a small number of patients at a single center and many of the retrospective patients in the initial phase of the study were lost to followup nonetheless the dramatic clinical improvement observed in the vast majority of patients obviating the need for oral antibiotic therapy in all patients throughout the course of the study is promising amid a growing epidemic of multidrugresistant s aureus therapies formulated with dilute sodium hypochlorite provide significant advantages over several other agents for the treatment of ad being well tolerated in the vast majority of patients and nontoxic to mucosal surfaces and lacking the potential to induce antimicrobial resistance larger randomized controlled studies are needed to confirm the clinical efficacy of this sodium hypochlorite–containing body wash in the treatment of moderate to severe ad the next study will aim to quantify changes in usage of each patients topical and systemic regimen during the course of therapy this product may also have a valuable role for other infectious indications and in primary prevention for groups or environments at higher risk for mrsa and methicillinsensitive s aureus colonization and infections including hospitalized patients and

company agrees to pay money to a designated beneficiary upon the death of the policy holder in exchange the policyholder pays a regularly scheduled fee known as the insurance premiums the purpose of life insurance is to provide financial support to those who survive the policyholder such as family members or business partners when the policyholder dies the insurance proceeds pass to the

organization and do not accumulate any cash surrender value term life insurance nofrills life insurance with neither cash surrender value nor loan value an amount that can be used as collateral for a loan term life insurance provides a preset amount of coverage if the policyholder dies during the period of time specified in the policy policyholders usually have the option to renew at the end of
