the main story share this page continue reading the main story photo credit bruce weber if  was the year unisex became a trend in fashion  may be the year the question of gender and dress enters an entirely different dimension at least judging by the style soothsayer nicolas ghesquière the artistic director of louis vuitton whose ability to sense social change and give it form has made him one of the most successful designers of his generationor rather judging by his instagram feed see mr ghesquière greeted the early days of january with a post unveiling his threepart springsummer vuitton women’s wear ad campaign coming to magazines in their february issues one section has a cast of models including jean campbell rianne van rompaey sarah brannon — and jaden smith the yearold actorrapperdesignerpontificator son of will smith and jada pinkett smiththe presence of mr smith in itself is not a big thing celebrities of all ages are regulars in fashion ads and mr smith’s younger sister willow was featured in marc jacobs’s fall campaign burberry often accessorizes its women’s wear ads with hip young men and for spring has added dylan brosnan son of pierce to the roster what sets the vuitton ads apart is that they feature mr smith as himself but in women’s clothingspecifically in pieces straight off the runway from the last women’s show a black leather jacket look no  originally worn by lily stewart a white cotton and metal embroidered top look no  and a metal embroidered kilt look no  continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story in other words he’s not a man in transition that’s been done before when riccardo tisci put a transgender model lea t in his fall  women’s ads or a man wearing clothing that looks as if it could be worn by either gender nor is he a man wearing womaninspired men’s wear like the men on the sonia rykiel prefall runway in fuchsiaandblackstriped twin sets and velvet tux trousers he is a man who happens to be wearing obviously female clothes and while he doesn’t look like a girl in them he actually looks pretty good it’s not about the hairylegsinaskirt bro cliché thank you so much louisvuitton and nicolasghesquiere for the opportunity to impact this world  a photo posted by jaden smith christiaingrey on jan   at am pst so what is it aboutit is possible to see this as sheer sensationalism there has been speculation that mr smith who has been wearing various bits of women’s clothes for a while now — a white skirt and black tux to a prom a flowered tshirt dress to coachella and making statements such as “i like wearing super drapey things so i can feel as though i’m a super hero” in an interview in gq — has done it mostly as a canny play for attention or to promote the idea of himself as a new thought leader “went to topshop to buy some girl clothes i mean ‘clothes’” he instagrammed last yearand certainly including him in its campaign makes vuitton appear edgy and forward thinking and millennial sensitive especially in the context of the other indie celebrities in the ads a south korean actress doona bae and the virtual star of the “final fantasy” video game lightning advertisement continue reading the main story mr smith “represents a generation that has assimilated the codes of true freedom one that is free of manifestoes and questions about gender” mr ghesquière stated “wearing a skirt comes as naturally to him as it would to a woman who long ago granted herself permission to wear a man’s trench or a tuxedo”translation this is the natural end stage of the fashion revolution started in the s and ’s when women took off their aprons and girdles and appropriated jeans this posits millennials as the real heirs to the me generation though it’s questionable whether many of mr smith’s  million instagram followers are also actual vuitton customersbut whatever the motivation of both parties and however pure or not the result has its own substanceit’s not unisex it’s not gender neutral or gender bending or gender free or any of the other expressions we’ve been using to describe the current clothesfluid moment because it is in fact entirely gendered at least going by traditional definitions of men’s versus women’s clothing the clothes and their conceptual allegiance have not changed at all the person wearing them has newsletter sign up continue

it was deliberately provocative however when alessandro michele dressed men in floral suits and sheer chiffon pussybow blouses on his recent gucci women’s runway as with vuitton it was more subtle a nudge to the question of why this was surprising at a time when gender definitions are as fluid as they have ever been and when there are efforts to codify the new reality be it on bathroom doors or in the language of institutions a push to the realization that though we long ago accepted women appropriating men’s clothes — and stopped thinking of it as appropriating — the idea of men appropriating women’s clothes is still largely taboobut while runways even in the age of social media are largely for the fashioncentric few global ad campaigns have a wider reach mr smith certainly thinks so since after mr ghesquière’s instagram he instagrammed in turn “thank you so much louisvuitton and nicolasghesquiere for the opportunity to impact this world”that could be overstating the matter but there’s no question clothes are one way we order the world we use them to tell if someone is male or female or wants to be one or the other what they do how much money they have what bands they like what country they come from etc whatever you do in your private life clothes are public signals about how to read you they are part of the social contract if that order is thrown up in the air how will we know what snap judgments to make how do we know how to interpret what we are seeing if interpretation is based on outmoded definitions of identityhow will we know what floors to shop on what fashion weeks to attendthe fear of semiological chaos and the force of historical convention explains in part why clothing norms have held on so long we want to understand what we are seeing and we want those seeing it to understand what we are saying advertisement continue reading the main story but here’s the thing as much as understanding we also want admiration to think we look good in what we are wearing fashion developed in part because the shapes flatter our different bodies what fits best stays how else to explain the eternal appeal of jeggings suits idealize and triangulate the male torso smoothing spare tires and hiding potbellies dresses nip and tuck and create curves where there were none mr smith looked good in his girl’s vuitton in part because of his coathangerlike frame he fit the runway samples and in part because the clothes have a gladiatorial edge but that doesn’t mean every man will in the end that may be the greatest factor mitigating against the complete dissolution of traditional boundaries between men’s and women’s wear and it may also be the real message of this particular moment we are entering the age of wear what you likehappy new year continue
