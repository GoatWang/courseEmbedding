heres whats happening newsfeedbackfoolcom jason hall jul    what happenedshares of navigator holdings ltd nyse nvgs a seaborne transporter of gas and liquid petrochemicals are up  at  pm edt on july  this follows the announcement late on july  that the company was partnering with energy giant enterprise products partners nyse epd which specializes in midstream services and energy infrastructure on the development of an ethylene export terminal at enterprises morgans point facility on the houston ship channelso what the terminal which will be developed through a  joint venture would service the ethylene storage and pipeline system with  million pounds of capacity that enterprise is currently building at the morgans point facility this facility will be connected to enterprises vast ethylene pipeline system which is connected to numerous major ethylene producers and consumers on the us gulf coastimage source getty imagesin scale this is a relatively small deal for enterprise since a significant amount of the ethylene it will store at the facility can be sold to domestic consumers and shipped via its existing pipeline system for navigator the implications are much bigger considering that  of its vessels  nearly  of its fleet  are capable of shipping ethylenenow whatbased solely on the vessel count the numbers make it appear that theres a ton of upside for navigator in this partnership but its really a bit early to say for sure to start todays agreement is only a letter of intent as the two parties still must negotiate the terms of the partnership this includes the financial contributions both parties will make their legal obligations and the timeline for completion and implementation of the export terminal realistically it could take years before the first tanker of ethylene is even shipped out of this facilityin other words theres a lot of investor speculation driving todays big price jump but thats been the norm for navigator holdings stock this year which was up as much as  this spring before selling off over the past few months before todays big jump shares were actually down  since january bottom line this big jump is heavily speculative and thats been the case for much of the momentum that has driven navigator holdings stock up and down and now back up this year this trend is likely to continue so keep that in mind if you plan to invest in the companyalso keep in mind that theres a lot more about this deal with enterprise products we dont know it probably will work out very well for navigator but we wont know until a final agreement is hammered out theres also a probably slim but not nonexistent chance that it falls apartfor that reason this isnt news id personally invest on better to wait for the parties to actually enter into the venture with timelines for completion of the project before speculating on what it might be worth  stocks we like better than navigator holdingswhen investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a
