the citibank simplicity card to transfer the balance but they wont do it reply thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review   submit comment  reply by comparecards  jan   hi marty it is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank the reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the citi simplicity is because the att access more credit card is issued by citibank as well but  apr is very high so i would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest two cards to consider that arent issued by citibank would be the chase slate which offers  months with  apr and no balance transfer fee or the discover it which has  months with  apr thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review by mohammed y hussain  jul   the best card i have is capital visa even though i had very bad credit first

wont do it reply thank you your comment has been submitted and is pending editorial review   submit comment  reply by comparecards  jan   hi marty it is a rule in the credit card industry that you cannot transfer balances between credit cards issued from the same bank the reason you are not able to transfer your balance to the citi simplicity is because the att access more credit card is issued by citibank as well but  apr is very high so i would certainly recommend transferring your balance to a low interest credit card to avoid paying a fortune in interest two cards to consider that arent issued by citibank would be the chase slate which offers  months with  apr and no balance transfer fee or the discover it which has  months with  apr thank you your comment has been submitted and is
