direct from dell strategies that revolutionized an industry  address dell inc  dell way round rock texas  httpwwwdellcom ■ michael dell defied conventional wisdom—that consumers would not purchase computer equipment over the telephone—and built a billiondollar company doing just that through his direct method of offering lowcost customconfigured personal computers direct to customers dell changed the competitive dynamic of the computer industry notable for a natural business talent coupled with a willingness to share power dell carried the company through rapid growth and economic difficulties he innovated operating processes took risks learned through his mistakes and built dell inc from a college dormitory operation to a global corporation along the way dell became one of the wealthiest americans and the youngest ceo of a company on the fortune  list of largest american companies entrepreneurial abilities emerge dell understood the meaning of business opportunity early in life as his mothers profession stockbroker frequently raised discussions of business and economic affairs at the family dinner table so when he began to collect stamps at age  and noticed prices rising dell recognized a business opportunity he determined the most profitable way to sell stamps would be to bypass the auctioneer and sell direct to collectors he compiled a page catalog of his and his friends stamps and advertised in a stamp collectors magazine in this first business venture dell earned  dell further developed his business acumen at the age of  when he sold newspaper subscriptions for the houston post the inefficiency of coldcalling prompted dell to find better marketing methods he determined that the people most likely to subscribe were newly married couples and people who had moved he obtained lists of marriage license applicants and mortgage applicants then used his apple ii computer to address sales letters to people on these lists the approach succeeded so well that dell earned  the first year and had bought a bmw automobile by the time he went to college in the back seat of that bmw dell carried three personal computers the seeds of pcs limited and dell computer corporation dells fascination with computers began with exposure to a data processor in junior high school then to computers at the local radio shack store after much persuasion dells parents allowed him to use savings to buy an apple ii computer at the age of  to the fury of his parents upon arriving home dell dismantled the computer to see how it operated the following year in  dell bought an ibm desktop computer and learned how to upgrade and add new components with insight that ibmcompatible computers would become the choice of business dell began to buy upgrade and resell personal computers for friends and acquaintances eventually purchasing components at wholesale rates from distributors exposure to the computer industry fostered dells desire to start a computer business in june  he skipped classes for most of a week to attend the national computer conference after saving money to buy a hard disk drive not standard equipment at the time dell communicated with other computer enthusiasts on a bulletin board system and learned how the industry operated he found dealers sold computers for  and made  gross profit yet he could purchase components for less than  founding dell computer corporation dell determined that he could compete with retail computer dealers by selling direct to consumers at a lower price and offering better technical service but his parents had another idea—that dell should become a physician dell went to the university of texas at austin in fall  while he attended to premed studies dell continued to upgrade and resell computers finding customers among students and local businesspeople through wordofmouth by the time his parents made a surprise visit in november to address poor class attendance dell knew he wanted to compete with ibm an attempt to be the good son and study premed lasted approximately three weeks then dell returned to upgrading computers in early  dell registered pcs limited with the state of texas and moved to a twobedroom condominium between wordofmouth referrals and a small advertisement in the local newspaper pcs limited sold between  and  per month in computers addon components and upgrade kits the week before final examinations in may  dell incorporated the company as dell computer corporation with the staterequired minimum of  capital he never returned to college pcs limited moved to a squarefoot office and dell hired a few people to take and fill orders and upgrade basic machines computer sales increased so rapidly that the company outgrew that facility and two larger ones in one year when the company moved into a squarefoot facility in  dell believed the space would never be used but that year the company began to design and build computers with purchased components dell hired an engineer to develop a  microprocessor from chip sets a strategy that simplified computer design in spring  dell introduced the fastest personal computer of the time a megahertz  processor the price of  compared favorably with ibms price of  for a megahertz  processor the machine caught the attention of the news media and garnered excellent performance reviews and a cover story in pc week sales exploded to  million that year despite speculation that consumers would not want to purchase a technologically complex product over the telephone dell succeeded from the start dell emphasized a customer focus another company could compete on price but quality products and excellent service would make dell computer sustainable over the long term the advantage of custom configuration and a direct relationship with customers meant that dell did not have to guess what a customer might want then attempt to inventory and sell preconfigured computers as the competition tended to do parts inventory and computer manufacturing processes were designed for rapid configuration and product delivery in a matter of days because the direct model did not allow the customer to see or handle the product however in  dell began to offer a day money back guarantee a first in the industry when the company began to pursue corporate business dell initiated another industry first in  nextday onsite service for personal computers in the customers home or office business as an experience in handson learning rapid growth challenged dells abilities as a businessman although he made many mistakes dell credited those mistakes with helping him learn quickly it was ironic that when dell made big mistakes those mistakes conflicted with his most cherished ideas to manage inventory to focus on the customer and to sell direct to the customer the first major mistake involved excess parts inventory and led to innovation in hightech production growing at a rapid pace the company bought as many parts as it could when technology changed in  however the company was left with memory chips that could not be used or sold the company had to raise prices to compensate for the loss slowing growth taking an unconventional approach to problem solving the company implemented supply process in partnership with vendors this strategy limited parts inventory so that when technology changed dell computer could adopt the new technology quickly during the late s dell refined supply chain management to less than an eightday lead whereas competitors maintained inventory of preconfigured computers for more than  days the vendor relationships worked because dell shared information and helped vendors stay abreast of technological change the second major mistake involved development of the olympic computer introduced in  with technology that far exceeded anything in the industry customers said they did not need that much technology while certain elements of the new technology were applied elsewhere dell realized he had not communicated with his customers before product development he learned that slow incremental change served the customer better the third problem involved entry into the retail market in  once profit and loss analysis by business segment was put into place dell discovered that the company lost money in retail although retail sales accounted for  percent of total sales and retail sales were growing more than  percent industrywide dell risked an exit from retail in  and refocused on the direct model dell launched wwwdellcom that year introduced online pricing in  and initiated online sales in  internet sales quickly reached  million per day and increased to  million per day in  dell computer entered the market for servers in  and storage products in  passing the cost savings of the direct model to customers again dells direct method selling servers and storage products directly over the telephone and then via the internet defied conventional wisdom seeking counsel and sharing power unlike many entrepreneurs dell learned to relinquish responsibility and share power when he could no longer handle responsibilities himself he sought the wisdom of experienced executives early in the companys history in  lee walker a venture capitalist and consultant joined dell computer and established a mentoring relationship with dell dell matured as a businessman when he accepted walkers decision to fire or demote most of the senior management staff recognizing the need to find people who could grow into positions of increasing responsibility as the company expanded walker encouraged dell to overcome his shyness as well as his reluctance to take a public role he persuaded dell to use his name for the company and its computer brand a change that took place in  in conjunction with the companys first international foray to the united kingdom walker brought two highprofile executives to the board of directors george kozmetsky the cofounder of teledyne and bobby ray inman the former chairman president and chief executive of westmark systems these executives provided dell executives with sound advice particularly as the company made its first offerings of stock—a private placement in october  and a public offering in june  when rapid growth surpassed the companys ability to provide quality products and service and operate profitably in the early s dell sought objective perspectives first he hired thomas j meredith of sun microsystems as chief financial officer in november  rather than simply pursue rapid growth as a goal dell adapted to the need to include data about cash liquidity and profitability into daily decision making when the company failed to launch quality laptop computer products in  dell hired john medica who had led development of the apple powerbook computer medica focused on a single product the latitude xp computer which gave dell computer its first significant share of the laptop market in  aware that even a ceofounder can be removed from position in a public company dell approached the board of directors in august  with an outline for improving operations and profitability he hired bain  company to assist with profit and loss analysis and to develop measurements that created responsibility and accountability at the level of each business unit in may  dell hired the former motorola executive morton l topfer as vice chairman topfers experience in product cycles and management restructuring fit well with dell computers needs for executive leadership dell handled products technology and general strategy and took a more public role that of customer relations dealing with the press and giving speeches topfer handled budget daytoday operations sales and marketing the change allowed dell to spend more time with his growing family and topfer brought ideas and discipline to a new emphasis on detailed longrange planning a threeyear goal of achieving  billion in revenue by the end of  was exceeded by  billion kevin rollins a bain  company consultant credited with recommending that dell computer cease retail operation joined the company in  and began to work with dell and topfer in the office of chairman in  the three men shared the responsibilities until topfer left in  afterward dell and rollins shared responsibilities working from adjoining offices divided by a glass wall and a glass door that never closed in  dell relinquished the ceo title to rollins a recognition that rollins was already functioning in that role rather than of a change in responsibilities maintaining the entrepreneurial spirit in a global corporation during the companys early years of rapid growth unconventional thinking and new ideas pervaded the decisionmaking process at dell a simple informal business process was the consequence and the facilitator of rapid expansion employees frequently handled any task needed such as taking orders when the telephone lines were busy that salespeople had to set up their own computers cultivated customer service through handson experience with the product from the point of view of the user as sales rose from the millions into the billions dell sought to maintain an entrepreneurial company culture while addressing the needs of a publicly owned global corporation involving more facts and data in the decisionmaking processes constituted a major adjustment to the freespirited entrepreneurial culture of the company a careful approach involved not pursuing every business opportunity but prioritizing because growth can occur too quickly and threaten the existence of the company rather than pursue every idea dell chose to examine ideas more closely in relation to the whole of the company and to develop chosen ideas to their full potential while he learned to apply facts to intuitive knowledge and an awareness of risk dell encouraged all of the attitudes embodied in the company culture from the start open communication and exchange of ideas across all levels of the organization contributed to a flexible nonhierarchal structure that allowed for quick responses in a constantly changing environment dell found employees spontaneous interactions and candid comments more helpful than planned presentations a learning attitude accepted failure as essential to the process of taking unconventional approaches to problems and openminded selfcriticism provided the foundation for innovation one way that dell strove to maintain the intimacy of a small company involved creating manageable business units beginning in the mids corporate sales divided into small and large companies then mediumsized companies international divisions divided into specific markets as sales increased in  sales to educational institutions segmented into kindergarten through grade  and higher education segmentation allowed executives to move into positions of manageable if fewer responsibilities the challenge of segmentation involved sustaining a sense of common goals to unify a large organization of people with diverse responsibilities dell believed that each individual needed to understand his or her role in contributing to overall success communication throughout the company via email newsletters and posters as well as compensation incentives furthered this goal competitiveness expands market share although dell was known to be friendly and approachable these qualities belied the competitiveness that helped his company become the leading manufacturer of personal computers worldwide although he designed the direct method with the intention of competing on price and service dell used that competitive edge whenever necessary in  when industry consolidation threatened smaller operations dell initiated a price war when he introduced servers in  dell knew that compaq used high profit margins in servers to offset low margins in desktop computers he also knew the direct model gave dell a price advantage when economic downturn negatively affected sales of personal computers dell initiated another price war beginning in january  adding aggressive advertising and cost cutting to the strategy dell restructured earlier than the competition reducing the companys workforce by  in february  and by another  jobs later that year dell also reduced inventory lead time to several hours supply trucks held inventory at the dock until needed on the factory floor when the customer paid for the computer in  months the company rose from number five in worldwide personal computer sales to number one dell competed directly with hewlett packard hp by initiating printer sales in  taking advantage of the atmosphere of uncertainty surrounding the merger between compaq and hp dell cut prices and captured market share when hp implied possible price increases to offset low profits in  dell cut prices again and captured market share dells entry into any product market or geographical market caused prices to decline a process referred to as the dell effect industry observers noted that competition on price hindered innovation as other companies cut research and development costs to remain profitable while dell relied on suppliers to innovate technology for dell focusing on the customer meant value at low cost with excellent service while dell emphasized a focus on the customer rather than the competition he and his

dell michael uxl newsmakers copyright  the gale group inc dell michael february   • houston texas chairman of dell inc in  as a firstyear college student in austin texas michael dell borrowed  from his parents to start a computer accessories business he began by selling kits to help customers upgrade their personal computers establishing a business model his company dell inc still follows today sell directly to consumers eliminating the middle step of a retail store or a distributor and hold on to far more of the profits in just two decades dells company grew to massive proportions with more than  employees and annual revenues of more than  billion dell himself was squarely at the top of forbes magazines list of the ten wealthiest americans under the age of forty he has been praised as a visionary and an innovator but he has also earned admiration for being a stable consistent leader in an industry that changes rapidly in terms of both technology and personnel dell has stood out from his peers by remaining at the helm of his company from its struggling early days to its current status as a major player in the global field of information technology it a businessman from the beginning michael saul dell was born in  in houston texas while he displayed intelligence and ingenuity from an early age he had little interest in school at the age of eight he sent away for information on taking a high school equivalency exam which if he passed would make him a high school graduate without having to endure the remaining years of school his parents insisted he stay in the classroom and dell invested his considerable creative energy in afterschool ventures when he was twelve years old he operated a mailorder trading business for stamps and baseball cards earning  at the age of fourteen dell got his first computer an apple ii and soon realized that he had a knack for taking computers apart and putting them back together while in high school dell took a job delivering newspapers for the houston post his aggressive selling strategies—which included obtaining mailing lists of newly married people offering them free trial subscriptions and then following up with phone calls—resulted in earnings of  not one to hold on to his spoils dell spent the money on a new bmw what people have never understood is that were not like other companies in  when dell entered his freshman year at the university of texas at austin his parents hoped he would become a doctor but dells skills lay elsewhere in examining the personal computer or pc industry he noticed an opportunity to sell pcs for less as he explained to richard murphy of success magazine i saw that youd buy a pc for about  and inside that pc was about  worth of parts ibm would buy most of these parts from other companies assemble them and sell the computer to a dealer for  then the dealer who knew very little about selling or supporting computers would sell it for  which was even more outrageous dell realized that he could assemble computer parts skip the step of selling to a dealer and go directly to the consumer that way the consumer could buy the product for less and dell held on to every penny of the profits dell thus combined his knowledge of computers with his welldeveloped business sense and began his own business assembling upgrade kits for personal computers in a  article in fortune dell recalled operating his new business out of his university of texas dorm room on the twentyseventh floor people would ride up to the th floor with their computers id put in some memory or a disk drive theyd pay me and id send them on their way his earnings soon reached about  a month by the summer of  after one year at the university dell had decided that he needed to focus all of his time on his business and he dropped out of college his company then called pcs unlimited began building pcs starting with parts from such established computer companies as ibm and compaq and adding elements to make the products unique dell continued to sell directly to consumers a strategy that paid off in vast sums by the end of  his company had earned  million dell was off and running leading his company to enormous growth year after year the envy of ceos everywhere by early  at the age of twenty dell had thirty employees working for him during the summer of that year the company began producing the turbo pc its first computer made entirely from scratch rather than a customized version of another companys machine in  dell changed the name of the company from pcs unlimited to dell computer corporation at that time he began a program offered by no one else in the industry rather than having customers bring brokendown computers to a store for repair dell computer would pay house calls to service its customers pcs in success magazine dell pointed out that this offer came out of necessity rather than an ingenious plan to outperform competitors that was a pretty important plus because we didnt have any stores he recalled during  dell began offering the public the opportunity to buy stock in his company just four years after the company had begun sales reached  million dell found success in his personal life at that time too he married susan lieberman in october of  residing in austins hill country the couple has four children a brief history of personal computers for many people it is nearly impossible to imagine life without computers yet it was not long ago that computers were a rare item seen perhaps by the average citizen only on television mainframe computers of the s took up entire rooms minicomputers were the size of refrigerators and microcomputers which eventually became known as personal computers pcs could fit on a desktop today many varieties of wireless computers can be held in the palm of a hand in the early s consumer demand for home and business computers began to develop about that time ed roberts owner micro instrumentation telemetry systems mits worked with engineers to develop the mits altair  this computer was sold as a kit for  it had to be assembled by the consumer who also had to write the software in spite of these hurdles mits was flooded with orders for the altair in  soon after the altair hit the market two young programmers approached roberts to inform him of an existing software program that could be adapted to work on the altair these programmers paul allen and bill gates then a firstyear student at harvard university created a version of the program called basic for the altair later mits went out of business and gates and allen founded microsoft the global software giant in about  xerox developed the alto a computer featuring a mouse and a pointandclick graphical user interface gui the company never marketed this computer to the public however as xerox management could not envision how consumers would use it computers that featured a gui including apples lisa and macintosh models did not become widespread for another ten years in  steve wozniak and steve jobs two computer hobbyists began working together to build their own pc using inexpensive parts the following year they founded apple computers and released the apple i in  apple computers released the apple ii considered by many to be the first true personal computer this pc which sold for just under  featured color graphics and a disk drive apples primary competitor was commodore which released the commodore pet in early  the pet had features similar to apple ii but was sold for half the price commodore also created the commodore  which featured a good deal of memory and color graphics and used inexpensive floppy disks for storing files the commodore  became the bestselling pc of all time computers were catching on with a small segment of the population but it was not until the invention of spreadsheet software in  that many businesses saw the benefits of using pcs with the development of visicalc a program invented by dan bricklin and bob frankston businesses calculating their finances could use computer software to perform in a few minutes tasks that had previously taken hours when a user changed one number in a column the software automatically calculated the change to every other number on the sheet changes that otherwise had to be done by hand during that same year wordstar a groundbreaking wordprocessing software was released and became immediately successful with wordstar and similar software users could create edit save and print documents using their computers with the release of the ibm pc—the computer credited with popularizing the phrase personal computer—in august of  the pc came to be seen as a vital business tool and a machine that could be useful to general consumers as well the ibm pc was designed with an open architecture meaning that similar computers built by other companies could use ibm software microsoft first with the development of msdos and later with windows became the primary developer of operating systems—the programs that run every other program on a computer—for ibmtype pcs while apple had popularized computers with graphical user interfaces microsoft became a major gui player with the release of its first windows operating system in  developments in the personal computer since that time have been less dramatic than in the early years focusing primarily on increasing memory speed and portability decreasing the machines size and improving the quality of the gui dell computer grew at an astronomical rate and with that growth came problems during  the industry as a whole was suffering a slowdown with consumers buying fewer pcs dell computer was suffering from numerous management problems the company scrapped plans for a new laptop computer when it realized the product was outmatched by its competitors an attempt to sell dell computers through retail outlets like best buy and walmart had failed recognizing that his company needed to be overhauled dell brought in several new highlevel managers with years of experience in hightech industries many of the daytoday responsibilities were delegated to these trusted executives leaving dell to concentrate on the companys overall vision and strategy the reorganization helped the company regain its footing a triumph marked by the hugely successful release of a new laptop computer the latitude xp many business analysts have suggested that one of dells secrets to success has been his ability to remain focused on his winning business model sell directly to consumers keep prices low and quality high and offer solid technological support to customers within thirtysix hours of a customer ordering a pc by phone or through the companys web site a custombuilt dell computer is shipped to keep its costs down the company maintains an extremely low inventory of computer parts at any given time housing only enough components to fulfill a few days worth of orders this strategy not only reduces the need for warehouse space but also ensures that in the rapidly changing computer industry dell always has in stock the newest parts its suppliers offer michael dell has been able to maintain his companys steady growth rate by selling not just to individual consumers but also to large corporations educational institutions and government agencies the company has expanded its line of products in recent years to include network servers powerful machines that run computer networks storage systems handheld computers and printers—an expansion signified by its  name change from dell computer to dell inc dell has extended its customer base throughout the world most notably into asia capturing  percent of the pc market in china by  during the summer of  dell who had been chairman and chief executive officer or ceo of his company relinquished the ceo position passing that title on to kevin rollins his former president and chief operating officer in a  interview with fortune magazine dell and rollins stated that the change in their job titles did not signal any major shift in the way the company would be run dell declared we run the business together and were going to continue since its beginnings in  the company has set a rapid pace for growth it took dell just twenty years to surpass industry leader hewlettpackard to hold the largest

way to sell and manufacture computers he turned this idea into a working business and started his own company before he even made it to college for several years he won national attention because of the great success he enjoyed at such a young age over time however people began to see that dell was more than just a wonder boy he was a pioneer in the fastpaced world of technology by  dell was the youngest chief executive officer ceo ever to lead a company in the fortune  a listing of the top us corporations by  he was the fifthrichest person in the united states we dive headfirst into change part of that is because its all weve ever known but its also because today its a must… to thrive on change you must understand how to give in to it flow with it and derive strength from it theres no other way selling stamps newspapers and computers michael dell was born on february   in houston texas his father alexander was an orthodontist and his mother lorraine was a stockbroker dells parents hoped he would follow his father and study medicine from an early age however dell had an interest in business eager to speed up his education dell sent for information that would prepare him for a test that would give him his high school diploma he was eight years old at the time dell did stay in school but spent a good deal of his time looking for ways to earn money at age twelve he started a business that sold stamps by mail to collectors he earned  in high school dell sold subscriptions for a local newspaper he figured that people just married or who had just bought new homes in houston would be likely customers so dell hired friends to help him check courthouse records for newly married couples and he scanned the listings of new home purchases by selling to those two specific groups dell made  in one year his income amazed his history teacher—she made less that year than dell did dell was interested in computers and he soon realized that selling them was a gold mine the parts inside a typical ibm pc only cost about  retailers bought the machines for  and sold them for  dell figured that someone could make money building their own computers and selling them directly to customers at a much lower price than the retailers charged dell began buying machines adding new parts and selling them locally he continued this business in  when he began taking classes in austin at

against the door and told him to move out in november  dells parents learned about his computer business and that he was skipping classes his father asked what he wanted to do with his life dells reply as he recounts in direct from dell was i want to compete with ibm to satisfy his parents dell tried to quit the computer business he lasted only a few weeks i knew in my heart dell later wrote that i was onto a fabulous business opportunity that i could not let pass me by dell officially launched his own computer company pcs limited a few months later he incorporated as dell computer corporation investing the  minimum required by texas law before the end of  he hired a local engineer to build a computer for him instead of reselling upgraded ibm machines at the end of the fiscal financial year of  sales of dellproduced machines hit  million as a new company dcc had to win customers with more than low prices to overcome the reluctance to buy a computer by mail dell offered a day moneyback guarantee he also made sure the company used the best parts available and he encouraged his engineers to build faster machines than ibm or other competitors as dell computers won more attention from pc magazines sales continued to rise despite their early success dell and his company were not perfect the company bought more chips than it needed right before prices for these computer brains fell for the first time dell says in direct from dell i started thinking i might be in over my head still the young ceo survived the crisis and learned from his mistakes he told forbes in  im guilty of doing too much and im guilty of not seeing mistakes coming what im not guilty of is making the same mistake twice during the early s dell hired several experienced executives to run his companys daytoday operations freeing him to focus on longterm strategy during one tough stretch at the company dell workers attended a rally wearing army fatigues—a sign of their determination to keep fighting dell joked with his employees telling them his daughters first words were daddy kill compaq daddy kill ibm a computer fortune by the late s dells shares in his company made him worth  billion employees and investors who had bought stock early on also became rich in texas they were sometimes called dellionaires dell appeared on the cover of national magazines and spoke often about his direct sales model which had so successfully cut out the middleman and made dcc a world leader in computers dell however was reluctant to discuss his wife their four children and their private life in  the media wanted to talk about the squarefoot home dell was building outside austin he seemed bothered by the attention telling fortune fame isnt everything its cracked up to be mort topfer dells righthand man in  when michael dell persuaded mort topfer to leave motorola and come work for him topfer only planned to stay a few months topfer was fiftyseven and he and his wife had just built a retirement home in las vegas nevada serving as vice chairman at dell however proved a welcome challenge and topfer stayed in that position for five years he helped dell realize a prediction he made to pc week soon after joining the company we are going to drive dell to be the top  or  and maybe even no  in the business born in brooklyn new york in  topfer earned a degree in physics from brooklyn college then took a job at rca laboratories where he worked in both research and management in  he joined motorola where he eventually became president of the companys land mobile products sector dell and topfer first met in january  and the two men discussed their business philosophies for several months before topfer came to dell as vice chairman in that role topfer handled the companys planning and manufacturing topfer and dell worked together to split dccs market into smaller segments targeting specific products to meet each segments unique needs topfer also served as a mentor to michael dell helping him cope with the demands of running a multibilliondollar company even after topfer stepped down as vice chairman in  he remained one of dells closest advisers he also stayed on the board of directors in  topfer founded a new company with his sons alan and richard castletop capital manages a  million fund to invest in small technology firms mostly in texas topfer is

education dells personal donations—numbering in the tens of millions of dollars—have gone to texas libraries theaters and other organizations observers say that dell has matured since he began his company as a nineteenyearold college student unlike some entrepreneurs he has been able to manage the huge corporation that grew from simple roots part of his skill was hiring the right people one

biography  life children parents name history school young old information born college world biography cage michael dell biography michael dell biography february   • houston texas chairman of dell inc dell michael  kim kulishcorbis in  as a firstyear college student in austin texas michael dell borrowed  from his parents to start a computer accessories business he began by selling kits to help customers upgrade their personal computers establishing a business model his company dell inc still follows today sell directly to consumers eliminating the middle step of a retail store or a distributor and hold on to far more of the profits in just two decades dells company grew to massive proportions with more than  employees and annual revenues of more than  billion dell himself was squarely at the top of forbes magazines list of the ten wealthiest americans under the age of forty he has been praised as a visionary and an innovator but he has also earned admiration for being a stable consistent leader in an industry that changes rapidly in terms of both technology and personnel dell has stood out from his peers by remaining at the helm of his company from its struggling early days to its current status as a major player in the global field of information technology it a businessman from the beginning michael saul dell was born in  in houston texas while he displayed intelligence and ingenuity from an early age he had little interest in school at the age of eight he sent away for information on taking a high school equivalency exam which if he passed would make him a high school graduate without having to endure the remaining years of school his parents insisted he stay in the classroom and dell invested his considerable creative energy in afterschool ventures when he was twelve years old he operated a mailorder trading business for stamps and baseball cards earning  at the age of fourteen dell got his first computer an apple ii and soon realized that he had a knack for taking computers apart and putting them back together while in high school dell took a job delivering newspapers for the houston post his aggressive selling strategies—which included obtaining mailing lists of newly married people offering them free trial subscriptions and then following up with phone calls—resulted in earnings of  not one to hold on to his spoils dell spent the money on a new bmw what people have never understood is that were not like other companies in  when dell entered his freshman year at the university of texas at austin his parents hoped he would become a doctor but dells skills lay elsewhere in examining the personal computer or pc industry he noticed an opportunity to sell pcs for less as he explained to richard murphy of success magazine i saw that youd buy a pc for about  and inside that pc was about  worth of parts ibm would buy most of these parts from other companies assemble them and sell the computer to a dealer for  then the dealer who knew very little about selling or supporting computers would sell it for  which was even more outrageous dell realized that he could assemble computer parts skip the step of selling to a dealer and go directly to the consumer that way the consumer could buy the product for less and dell held on to every penny of the profits dell thus combined his knowledge of computers with his welldeveloped business sense and began his own business assembling upgrade kits for personal computers in a  article in fortune dell recalled operating his new business out of his university of texas dorm room on the twentyseventh floor people would ride up to the th floor with their computers id put in some memory or a disk drive theyd pay me and id send them on their way his earnings soon reached about  a month by the summer of  after one year at the university dell had decided that he needed to focus all of his time on his business and he dropped out of college his company then called pcs unlimited began building pcs starting with parts from such established computer companies as ibm and compaq and adding elements to make the products unique dell continued to sell directly to consumers a strategy that paid off in vast sums by the end of  his company had earned  million dell was off and running leading his company to enormous growth year after year michael dell answers a call from a customer apwide world photo reproduced by permission the envy of ceos everywhere by early  at the age of twenty dell had thirty employees working for him during the summer of that year the company began producing the turbo pc its first computer made entirely from scratch rather than a customized version of another companys machine in  dell changed the name of the company from pcs unlimited to dell computer corporation at that time he began a program offered by no one else in the industry rather than having customers bring brokendown computers to a store for repair dell computer would pay house calls to service its customers pcs in success magazine dell pointed out that this offer came out of necessity rather than an ingenious plan to outperform competitors that was a pretty important plus because we didnt have any stores he recalled during  dell began offering the public the opportunity to buy stock in his company just four years after the company had begun sales reached  million dell found success in his personal life at that time too he married susan lieberman in october of  residing in austins hill country the couple has four children a brief history of personal computers for many people it is nearly impossible to imagine life without computers yet it was not long ago that computers were a rare item seen perhaps by the average citizen only on television mainframe computers of the s took up entire rooms minicomputers were the size of refrigerators and microcomputers which eventually became known as personal computers pcs could fit on a desktop today many varieties of wireless computers can be held in the palm of a hand in the early s consumer demand for home and business computers began to develop about that time ed roberts owner micro instrumentation telemetry systems mits worked with engineers to develop the mits altair  this computer was sold as a kit for  it had to be assembled by the consumer who also had to write the software in spite of these hurdles mits was flooded with orders for the altair in  soon after the altair hit the market two young programmers approached roberts to inform him of an existing software program that could be adapted to work on the altair these programmers paul allen and bill gates then a firstyear student at harvard university created a version of the program called basic for the altair later mits went out of business and gates and allen founded microsoft the global software giant in about  xerox developed the alto a computer featuring a mouse and a pointandclick graphical user interface gui the company never marketed this computer to the public however as xerox management could not envision how consumers would use it computers that featured a gui including apples lisa and macintosh models did not become widespread for another ten years in  steve wozniak and steve jobs two computer hobbyists began working together to build their own pc using inexpensive parts the following year they founded apple computers and released the apple i in  apple computers released the apple ii considered by many to be the first true personal computer this pc which sold for just under  featured color graphics and a disk drive apples primary competitor was commodore which released the commodore pet in early  the pet had features similar to apple ii but was sold for half the price commodore also created the commodore  which featured a good deal of memory and color graphics and used inexpensive floppy disks for storing files the commodore  became the bestselling pc of all time computers were catching on with a small segment of the population but it was not until the invention of spreadsheet software in  that many businesses saw the benefits of using pcs with the development of visicalc a program invented by dan bricklin and bob frankston businesses calculating their finances could use computer software to perform in a few minutes tasks that had previously taken hours when a user changed one number in a column the software automatically calculated the change to every other number on the sheet changes that otherwise had to be done by hand during that same year wordstar a groundbreaking wordprocessing software was released and became immediately successful with wordstar and similar software users could create edit save and print documents using their computers with the release of the ibm pc—the computer credited with popularizing the phrase personal computer—in august of  the pc came to be seen as a vital business tool and a machine that could be useful to general consumers as well the ibm pc was designed with an open architecture meaning that similar computers built by other companies could use ibm software microsoft first with the development of msdos and later with windows became the primary developer of operating systems—the programs that run every other program on a computer—for ibmtype pcs while apple had popularized computers with graphical user interfaces microsoft became a major gui player with the release of its first windows operating system in  developments in the personal computer since that time have been less dramatic than in the early years focusing primarily on increasing memory speed and portability decreasing the machines size and improving the quality of the gui dell computer grew at an astronomical rate and with that growth came problems during  the industry as a whole was suffering a slowdown with consumers buying fewer pcs dell computer was suffering from numerous management problems the company scrapped plans for a new laptop computer when it realized the product was outmatched by its competitors an attempt to sell dell computers through retail outlets like best buy and walmart had failed recognizing that his company needed to be overhauled dell brought in several new highlevel managers with years of experience in hightech industries many of the daytoday responsibilities were delegated to these trusted executives leaving dell to concentrate on the companys overall vision and strategy the reorganization helped the company regain its footing a triumph marked by the hugely successful release of a new laptop computer the latitude xp many business analysts have suggested that one of dells secrets to success has been his ability to remain focused on his winning business model sell directly to consumers keep prices low and quality high and offer solid technological support to customers within thirtysix hours of a customer ordering a pc by phone or through the companys web site a custombuilt dell computer is shipped to keep its costs down the company maintains an extremely low inventory of computer parts at any given time housing only enough components to fulfill a few days worth of orders this strategy not only reduces the need for warehouse space but also ensures that in the rapidly changing computer industry dell always has in stock the newest parts its suppliers offer michael dell has been able to maintain his companys steady growth rate by selling not just to individual consumers but also to large corporations educational institutions and government agencies the company has expanded its line of products in recent years to include network servers powerful machines that run computer networks storage systems handheld computers and printers—an expansion signified by its  name change from dell computer to dell inc dell has extended its customer base throughout the world most notably into asia capturing  percent of the pc market in china by  during the summer of  dell who had been chairman and chief executive officer or ceo of his company relinquished the ceo position passing that title on to kevin rollins his former president and chief operating officer in a  interview with fortune magazine dell and rollins stated that the change in their job titles did not signal any major shift in the way the company would be run dell declared we run the business together and were going to continue since its beginnings in  the company has set a rapid pace for growth it took dell just twenty years to surpass industry leader hewlettpackard to hold the largest share of the computermaking market a  article in the economist summed up dells accomplishment stating there is hardly a more admired boss than mr

getty images michael dell ceo took his eponymous company private in october  leadershipcompanies  executives michael dell talks about the benefits of running a private company michael dell shares his opinion about how financial markets impact the running a manufacturing business excerpts from inc and forbes patricia panchak  jul   the man who to date led the privatization of one of the largest companies by revenue has something to say about how finance influences business decisions michael dell ceo took his namesake round rock texbased company private in october  the year it ranked  in the iw us  with nearly  billion in revenue dell shared his opinion in the julyaugust edition of inc people see that there is a problem of too much shortterm thinking in financial markets its a real affliction that we were able to extract ourselves from that and think much more about the medium and long term thats an idea people get excited about we can be on offense all the time as a private company were investing aggressively in knowledge and talent and resources if you are running a public company youve got to deliver shortterm results you need to deliver this amount of earnings the quarter so your investment approach is going to be modified on top of that theres always the threat of shareholder activism people saying oh you have too much cash on your balance sheet why dont you give us a dividend why dont you do a share repurchase why dont you spin off that division or split the company up thats a very different approach than i can take as the founderowneroperator the ultimate longterm investor we can move more quickly as a private company describing the  departure of a cfo dell writes if an officer is going to leave thats a big deal for a public company had we been public we would have had to plan the timing of the announcement think about all the questions that might arise and get all these opinions from different people we might have waited  days to make the decision official that kind of thing happens all the time and its total nonsense as a private company though we knew exactly what to do we had a successor ready to go and we announced it almost instantly indeed being free from shareholder demands is part of what made possible the  billion deal to take dell private noted a november  forbes article the growthchallenged company will be buried under just less than  billion in debt in an industry in secular decline but carl icahn former shareholder and critic of the deal knows what dell does that without dividends and buybacks he should have enough cash flow to cover the interest payments and without the public markets to worry about he has the flexibility to pull off the rebalancing act being a private company also will allow dell to leverage the companys pc business in a way that would be impossible for a public company forbes explained most critically the world’s thirdlargest personal computer maker has no plans to abandon the pc despite that product line’s sinking fortunes in fact he plans to sell way more of them and if the recent past is any guide he may just sell them at a loss selling commodity boxes on the cheap allows him to get dell in the door to upsell customers on lucrative software and services dell has driven down the prices of pcs many times before but a pc maker selling pcs as a loss leader that’s the kind of thing you get to do when you take a company private we’ve always viewed pcs as a business that’s got a life cycle to it growth is in new areas and it’s a business you’ve got to manage very efficiently from a cost structure it’s still a great way to get into new customers says dell   michael dell keynote on leading a private company in this brief clip from the opening keynote at dell

submitted by a student this is not an example of the work written by our professional essay writers the first attribute and most importantly from the leader is the decision to become a leader at what point of time and the leaders decide they want to provide others with vision and guiding the course of events in the future and inspire others to achieve success these people have some characteristics that help people identify the leaders of this trust and ethics discipline and respect leadership requires the individual in the exercise of power and responsibility if someone choose to become a leader whether in community workplace or in a state of emergency and discuss these characteristics will help leaders develop the right mix of qualities skills and ambition one important quality of a good leader is trust when the leader believes in him and others follow suit leaders cannot expect others to believe them if they doubt themselves or they make decisions in addition in order to lead one must be a strong set of moral values and a fixed set of values â€‹â€‹is always one reference when faced with a difficult decisionmaking people should be able to predict how they would react to their leader some cases because they know what faith in which they live leader with the moral values â€‹â€‹gives those who they lead to ensure that the decisions they make will be desirable ones another feature that a good leader should have is discipline good leaders must be able to discipline themselves first and then those in which they live with a little effort and should be a leader be able to put others on the right track finally all leaders need to respect respect for themselves and respect for others and most importantly respect from others leader with no respect for any leader

leadership earlier theories discussed more the leaders as people born with special characteristics which make them leaders one of the earliest theories defines leadership is the great man theory also called heroes by thomas carlyle which suggest that leaders born not made it also suggests that leaders come when there is a great need trait theory followed the same base suggesting that leaders inherit special traits and the right combination of traits make them leaders behavioral theories worked against earlier theories suggesting that leadership can be learned and made these theories look into what leaders do one of the famous theories is managerial grid by blake and mouton in the s who described leaders based on their concern for people against their concern for production figure  the managerial grid by mounton  blake   the contingency leadership theory came with an idea that there is no one best way to lead people it suggests that an effective leadership style in some situations may not be successful in other situations least preferred coworker lpc theory by fred fiedler is based on scoring leaders opinion about their coworker and their preference to work with again based on positive factors friendly helpful etc and negative factors unfriendly gloomy etc high lpc leaders tend to be more supportive and have close and positive relationships low lpc leaders are task oriented

overload kevin harrington entrepreneur michael dell home top  how to magazine franchise  spotlight subscribe growth strategies michael dell taking the direct approach michael dell founder of dell computer corp founded  shares you dont have to be a genius or a visionary or even a college graduate to be successful you just need a framework and a dreammichael dellmichael dell wasnt the only young entrepreneur to ride the computer boom of the late s and early s from rags to riches like rod canion of compaq and steve jobs of apple dell turned a fledging startup into a multibilliondollar computer empire but unlike the illfated canion and jobs who lost control of their creations as they grew dell has managed to hold on to the reins of his maverick venture and achieve the unique distinction of being the computer industrys longesttenured ceofollowing the simple idea that by selling customized personal computer systems directly to customers he could best understand their needs and provide the most effective computing solutions to meet those needs dell has made dell computer corp the worlds leading direct computer systems companydells parents wanted him to be a doctor but by the time he was in junior high dell was hooked on computers while most of his classmates were tinkering under the hoods of old cars dell loved to tinker with his apple iieto please his parents dell enrolled as a premed student at the university of texas in  but by then his only real interest was in computers during his first semester dell spent his spare time buying up remaindered outmoded pcs from local retailers then upgrading and selling them from his dorm room he was so successful that one day his roommate piled his evergrowing inventory up against the door of their dorm roomdell took this as a sign it was time to move his burgeoning business off campus his parents were furious when he told them he wanted to drop out of college so to appease them dell agreed to go back to school if the summers sales proved disappointing in his first month in business dell sold some  worth of pcs he never returned for his sophomore yearwhile looking for ways to expand his fledgling startup dell concluded computers would soon become a commodity and with commodities what matters most is price and delivery dell saw that the quickest way to achieve both goals was to cut out the middleman he realized that he could buy components and assemble the whole pc himself more cheaply then he could sell each machine over the phone directly to customers at a  percent discount to established brands this technique which came to be known as the direct model of selling would revolutionize the industry and make dell a multibillionaire in the processthe yearold dell dubbed his venture pcs ltd and the austinbased company soon became one of the fastestgrowing enterprises in the country rather than flooding the market with hundreds of thousands of plain brown wrapper computers the company would focus on what it did bestcreating customized machines to orderthe strategy worked during its first year in operation pcs limited pulled in more than  million in sales and dell quickly gained a reputation as a boy wonder to cash in on his growing fame he changed the companys name to dell computer corp in  sales continued to soar topping  million by the end of  that same year dell made an initial public offering which raised  million about  million of which went directly into dells pocketfor many startup entrepreneurs that would have been a pinnacle signaling it was time to move on to the next promising adventure but in dells mind he was just getting started he now set his sights on overtaking industry leader ibm rallying his employees by telling them his newborn daughters first words were daddy kill ibm the technique got a response and dells sales leapt to more than  million by  in  dell set a goal of passing the  billion mark by the end of the year always the overachiever dell met his goal and then some as sales rocketed to  billion but in the midst of this success there were storm clouds gathering on the horizonthe company was growing at a pace that was too fast for the young entrepreneur to handle by mid dell computer corp seemed to be spiraling out of control stock prices had plummeted from  in january of  to a mere  by july dells cfo resigned leaving a management void and worst of all dell had scrapped all its new lines of notebook computers because of poor production and was forced to sit on the sidelines of the fastestgrowing segment of the pc market for more than  monthsdell realized he needed to do somethingand do it quickly his solution was to seek out older more experienced managers to help him regain control of his yearold juggernaut first he brought in mort topfer a seasoned executive from motorola to handle daytoday operations next he tapped the talents of kevin rollins an organizational expert from bain and co to run the american operations and perhaps his most important coup dell stole apple powerbook designer john medicawithin  months the listing company was righted and the following year profits climbed to  million but even with this amazing turnaround dell knew his companys place in the increasingly competitive pc industry was in no way guaranteed to ensure continued success dell and his top executives made a pair of controversial strategic decisions that ran counter to prevailing industry trends first instead of initiating a price war in pursuit of greater sales units dell chose to focus on highmargin business customers second the company opted to rely exclusively on direct marketing rather than retailindustry pundits questioned the second move pointing out that by selling direct dell was slighting the then sizzling home pc market but dell knew better in an earlier brief foray into retail stores dell discovered he could not compete with compaqs strong brand name and packard bells cutthroat pricing selling through retail stores was definitely out but dell wasnt about to give up the lucrative consumer market instead he decided to sell fully customized pcs via phone fax and direct sales to more sophisticated secondtime home computer buyersonce again dell proved his critics wrong the companys new approach had sales topping  billion by the end of  but dell had yet another ace up his sleeve in july  dell launched one of the first directsale computer web sites and in just two months was averaging internet sales in excess of  million a day a number that would rise to  million a day by  the combination of selling direct via phone and internet pushed dells sales to  billion by february until this time industry experts and dells three main rivals compaq ibm and hewlettpackard were convinced that direct sales would only gain dell a niche market but as dells direct onslaught began to increasingly cut into their market share all three competitors adopted the direct model of selling but unlike dell continued to offer their machines through retail stores as wellwhether or not compaq ibm and hewlettpackards revamped strategy will eventually recapture the market share lost to dell remains to be seen but by being first dell definitely has the advantage as the numbers clearly show while the pc industry grew by a paltry  percent in  dell grew at an incredible pace of more than  percent achieving sales of  billion by january  dell was outselling both ibm and hewlettpackard and was poised to overtake the numberone computer maker archrival compaqwhile he has yet to completely silence his critics michael dell has proven that he has the flexibility the stamina and the vision to remain at the top of the countrys most competitive business even through the bumpiest of times as internet sales rocket skyward  million a day in july  dell continues to baffle his competitors astound analysts and enthrall stockholdersif it aint brokefix it anywayone of the reasons dell computer corp has remained so successful is michael dells firm belief in constantly rethinking his companys operations case in point although the companys computers have always boasted some of the highest quality ratings in the pc industry in  dell became obsessed with finding a way to reduce his machines failure rate convinced that the key to achieving this goal lay in reducing the frequency hard drives were handled during assembly dell insisted that the number of touches be dramatically cut down from the existing level of more than  after extensively revamping the companys production lines the number of touches was trimmed to fewer than  the result the rate of rejected hard drives fell by  percent and the overall failure rate for dell pcs dropped by  percentbusiness in his bloodmichael dell has often been quoted as saying i always knew i wanted to run a business someday indeed it does appear that dell was born a businessman at the age of  he was making thousands of dollars in mail order sales to stamp collectors during his senior year in high school he made  selling newspaper subscriptions for the now defunct houston post and bought his first bmwpaying in cash no less obviously no ordinary paperboy dell had figured out that the most likely subscribers were newlyweds or families who had just moved in so using sources such as the city marriage license bureau he put together a targeted mailing list on his first computeran apple iieand sent out personalized mailings offering special subscription deals by age  dell was telling people his lifes ambition was to compete with ibm ironically today a lot of folks at ibm have the ambition of competing with dell radicals  visionaries grow your business dell michael dell icons next article the small business
