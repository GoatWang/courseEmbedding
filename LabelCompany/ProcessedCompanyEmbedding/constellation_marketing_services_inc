dissonance and influence marketing  constellation research inc skip to main content feb   cognitive dissonance and influence marketing by sam fiorella despite social proof casting doubt on their veracity it seems that social scoring platforms continue to be popular in social media marketing we shouldn’t be surprised these tools offer a quick if not effective means of identifying those who might help brand messages cut through the growing online noise  despite this i’m still rather optimistic on the future of influence marketing i’ve been pleased with the changes i’ve noted while presenting our book and its methodology to clients and general audiences at conferences this past yearwhile slow there’s definitely recognition that audience segmentation and customer decisionmaking processes are largely ignored by marketers and platforms seeking to use influence marketing as a key business development strategythe next level of influence – cognitive dissonancea premise that seems to resonate well with audiences exploring true influence marketing is the concept of cognitive dissonance which social scientists explain as a feeling of discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefsin terms of influence marketing we can think of it this way what transpires in the minds of potential consumers when a product recommendation offered by socially popular personalities or media outlets conflicts with preconceived notations or previous experiences with that productsimilarly what occurs in the purchase decision process when online social recommendations conflict with the consumer’s social political or religious viewsa popular example is cigarette marketing during the s which positioned smoking as healthy when early medical evidence demonstrated a link between smoking and cancerthis is a good example of cognitive dissonance through various media channels celebrities were used to advocate the smoking of cigarettes yet consumers were – often subconsciously – aware that cigarettes were bad for their health  a conflict existed similarly we can look to those advocating boycotts of brands like chicfila for speaking out against gay rights the desire to eat at the popular fast food establishment may conflict with moral social and political views in manywhich conflicting side wins when consumers make a decision and how do marketers use influence marketing to sway those decisionscreating cognitive dissonanceit’s important to note that often the dissonance that exists in consumers’ minds is created by conflicting social commentary or opposing recommendations a prime example is the battle occurring between android and ios mobile operating systemsconsumers are faced with conflicting messages from influencers media and advertising that promote one over the other consumers whose personal preferences and experiences match those shared by a large online community find their decisionmaking process conflicted when faced with overwhelming social advocacy for the alternativewhen marketers understand the logistics of cognitive dissonance it can be used as an effective marketing strategyfor example androidbased mobile phone manufacturers can use monitoring software and natural language processing to discover online conversations that would indicate which groups of consumers are experiencing cognitive dissonance that would negatively affect purchase decisions to their favorfrom this base marketers can realign both content marketing and influencer identification efforts to support those whose decision to buy an androidbased device is conflicted or to insert conflict into the decisionmaking process of those whose instinct is to purchase an iosbased deviceunderstanding the effects of cognitive dissonance on consumer behavior is a new frontier for influence marketing and can be used offensively as well as defensivelymanaging existing customersof course this dissonance occurs postpurchase as well and so it’s critical to apply this thinking to existing customers just as prospects experience cognitive dissonance when making a purchase decision social science and psychology has proven the concept of “buyer’s remorse” in customersmost consumers experience some cognitive dissonance even if just momentarily after purchasing a product“did i make the right decision”“did i shop around enough”“was there a better price available elsewhere”the existence of this conflict can be damaging towards a brand’s efforts to build repeat business and brand advocates we discuss this in influence marketinginfluence marketing is often relegated to customer acquisition efforts yet the need to create advocates and social proof around a brand necessitates better engagement with existing customers identifying cognitive dissonance in existing customers allows marketers to pinpoint the microinfluencers that may help alleviate the tension and sway their belief towards a feeling of satisfaction with the purchase and possibly even advocacy left alone consumers with these feelings may return the product or worse turn to social channels to complain about it the returns and online negativity can be curbed when true influence marketing techniques are applied to this consumer segmentbe it defensive or offensive sales strategy or customer satisfaction efforts the use of influence marketing to offset cognitive dissonance in prospects and customers is a science that marketers must quickly become adept at business research themes digital marketing and sales effectiveness nextgeneration
