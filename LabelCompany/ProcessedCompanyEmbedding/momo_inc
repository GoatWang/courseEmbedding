expectjan  about momo momo china stock research longterm horizon value research analyst chinachina stock researchsummarythe app could run afoul of chinas internet policeallegations against the founder are troubling indicator of corporate governancelooks like a highrisk investment with little clarity on future prospectsmomo momo profile was the last china stock to ipo in the us in  and was initially greeted by great expectations based on the potential of its locationbased app technology after taking a closer look at the company its financials and considering the current environment in china it seems like a stock that should be off limits to all except those with a high risk tolerance when the company first launched its app in  the main feature was finding other users in the nearby vicinity indeed search results were organized by distance closest shown first something which led to many chinese netizens joking that it was basically an app to find a date the kind which dont require flowers after relatively humorous beginnings the app has matured perhaps rolling out something as edgy as radar map for local area singles was a clever way to get a user base quickly the company added more features for members enhanced profiles custom emoticons etc which have helped momo begin to monetize its user base which it claimed was over  million strong at the end of fy but there is a decidedly different side to the story that could be a business risk that many investors may not be considering what does momo really do something people outside of china might not know is that the culture is rather conservative example the term boyfriend basically means fiancée who hasnt proposed yet but will casual dating doesnt really exist like it does in the west this could be a problem for momo which has a somewhat colorful reputation as chinas tinder this may seem absurd why would the government care but chinas defense of morals and culture have snared more than a few victims in the past one handy example is sina corp sina profile which had two internet content licenses revoked in  a more recent headscratching event showcasing the moral police on patrol is a domestic drama that was temporarily suspended and then later censored to remove actresses plunging necklines in early  authorities in china began its clean the web campaign in april  and it although there havent been any highprofile targets as of late that does not by any means indicate that the campaign is over indeed judging by earlier moves by the xi administration to incorporate a sense of morality in chinas art even banning weird architecture guessing what may happen next seems almost impossible achieving a comfort level with momos app requires acknowledging that the app operates in a relatively uncharted territory in china and with it comes legitimate risks the company can maintain that its app is only for meeting new friends and acquaintances but as sina learned last april it may ultimately be responsible for its members who use the app outside of the intended scope and the app seems to be on authorities radar judging by a  editorial in xinhua caveat emptor indeed financials momo is a young company and its financial results do not provide much basis for analysis two full years of annual data and seven quarters during most of which there was no revenue the companys product the app is still very new and although there has been progress on the monetization front there is little information available to measure how the business performs in different conditions ie multiple operating cycles another area where momo falls short is providing operating metrics for time series analysis operating metrics are important nonfinancial indicators that can gauge how the business is performing in ways that a pl cant the company does provide some data in the form of mau dau and paying member data however it was less than two years worth one of which includes zero revenue so analyzing the financial impact of half of the data isnt meaningful as an illustration of how important operating data can be to framing financial results the company reported a huge runup in sales and marketing spending right before its q ipo spending more than the previous four quarters of revenue momo also reported to have over  million registered users by the end of q well investors have little to go on to gauge if the rampup in marketing spending will help drive revenue or if was instead a way to pad the stats before the ipo either scenario is possible and without some time series analysis to estimate the lag effect of marketing spending and revenue guesswork is required legal trouble ahead so what right before momo ipoed netease nasdaqntes unleashed some very troubling allegations against the cofounder and ceo yan tang accusing mr tang of violating his employment agreement with netease affiliate wangzhiyi specifically the complaint noted that momo was founded in july  and launched its first app in august  a period during which mr tang was still an employee of a netease affiliate although the complaint seemed like little more than a competitive barb it included a request for an apology but did reserve the right for more legal action this should be something on shareholders radar the reason this seemingly harmless issue warrants attention is because if true one could conclude that mr tang places little import on legally binding documents like his employment contract the counterpoint that he was probably on garden leave is valid but the issue may shed some light on corporate governance practices at momo it seems pertinent to note that momo uses a vie structure something which separates shareholders from the actual assets that drive the business the vie is owned by the cofounders of the company and is responsible for  of the revenue that momo generates there is only a series of contractual arrangements tying operating assets to shareholders claims and as such shareholders are placing a significant degree of trust in momos executives to act in their best interests if the netease allegations turn out to be true it could seriously call into question momos corporate governance alibaba backing it doesnt really matter its not news that ecommerce powerhouse alibaba nysebaba invested in momo in a preipo funding round there seems to be a general sentiment that this means that momo has received a blessing from alibaba therefore making it a safe bet for the long run ignoring the absurdity of coattails investing making an investment on the premise that another investor has performed adequate due diligence taking a step back shows that this might not be a sound investment strategy although following in alibabas footsteps would have worked out when the company took a stake in autonavi before eventually buying outright buying in around  in may  holding out for  a year later the same cant be said for youku tudou yoku profile or weibocom nasdaqwb investors both stocks are considerably closer to their week lows than their highs it would seem that an investment from alibaba is no silver bullet the takeaway momo looks like a high risk investment partially due to the limited operating history but also due to the unique characteristics of regulating the chinese internet from our perspective the latter is the biggest risk to investors and something which cant really be hedged one top news story away from being a major problem the company could eventually prove that all of the abovementioned potential issues are inconsequential however

the look better than factory wheels the chrome wheels on a  buick lucerne i bought for my wife were peeling and corroding even though the car only has  miles and is a little old ladys car the wheels looked bad and could cause tire leaks i researched many wheels online and looked locally but i kept coming back to carid they seemed very professional and i called a few times before ordering to ask questions and they were very helpful i opted to get the momos in a package with michelin defender tires i was very impressed with how they came packaged and arrived with no damage i had my dealer mount them with no problems the ride and handling are fantastic now momo wheels are a quality product and i recommend them to anyone i will definitely check carid the next time i need anything for any

inseam on a pair of pants has to be right for them to fit your body your wheels have to be the right size for them to fit properly on your car or truck diameter diameter is the most familiar wheel dimension when someone says they have  rims theyre referring to the wheel diameter diameter is the distance between the bead seating areas where the tire seals to the rim at the opposite sides of the

ensure that all of the rims weve selected for you are produced from the richest alloys and steel each wheel is expertly designed and thoughtfully manufactured using the latest in technology to guarantee oem precision stronger shinier and way hotter  the right rims always make a huge difference a custom wheel may seem simple yet the production process that stands behind it is by no means an easy thing to do manufacturing of a rim starts by melting the material magnesium or aluminum alloys or steel at an extremely high temperature the raw material is poured in a preformed cast the designers let the metal cool down and then they trim off any excess material after the sample is shaped it is inspected for the imperfections and defects to guarantee the highest quality of the final product in case there are any flaws they are either cured at this stage or the wheel is modified altogether surely rims are not made in the same way so when a new design is created from scratch each manufacturer may use a variation of the above process to make a custom wheel stronger the ready product is brought into an oven to be heattreated after a rim is cooled it is inspected once again this time the sample is examined for leaks and impact reaction if a prototype complies with all the quality standards and requirements and features a perfect fit for a certain vehicle the ready sample is kept for future forgings and casts the wheels that are made for distribution simply copy the technique used for the prototype after the ready custom wheels are sprayed with primer they are carefully scanned for any blemishes or shortcomings at the end of the manufacturing process the final finish is applied to the rims whatever finish you choose be it chromeplating blackpowder coating or custom color it is applied at this point there is no compromise when it comes to design efficiency and fit of the aftermarket wheels weve handpicked for you our aim is to provide you with the most extensive

pacificwagnerweaponrwest coastwheel masterswheel matewhite knightwilwoodclear allany car owner who has sprung for a set of large diameter custom rims and lowprofile performance tires knows how expensive they are unfortunately so do thieves and in addition to those that might want a free set of wheels and tires for their own car there are many more who want to flip them so they can put cash in their pockets the value of today’s rims and tires and the ease with which they can be stolen – all it takes is a jack and a cordless impact wrench and a set can be removed in just minutes – make them a tempting target wheel locks are an affordable and effective theft deterrenta stolen set of wheels and tires may leave you stranded at a most inopportune time and place your vehicle could also be damaged during the theft  the thieves only want your wheels and tires they don’t care about your car and unless your auto insurance policy specifically covers aftermarket custom parts you may find yourself out several thousand dollars and be faced with having to come up with another set of wheels and tires out of pocket wheel locks are cheap compared with the cost of a set of wheels and tires our wheel locks are easy to use and function just like regular lug nuts each set has a unique computergenerated pattern that will only accept the supplied key tool that is necessary for removal and installationthe high quality steel and hardening process used in the construction of our wheel locks ensures the ultimate in security and the triple chrome plating provides long lasting luster but don’t let your wheel lock be the only shiny lug on each wheel the average chromeplated lug nut is subjected to corrosion and discoloration from the elements plus the surface of the lug nuts can be further marred by lug wrenches and impact guns every time they’re removed and installed don’t let wheel lugs like that detract from the appearance of your wheels like our wheel locks our lug nuts are also triple chrome plated to resist corrosion and provide longlasting shine that won’t rust chip or peel and if chrome’s not your thing we also have lug nuts that come anodized in a variety of colors the easiest way to upgrade the security and appearance of your wheels and tires is with a wheel installation kit the kit includes one lock for each of the four wheels the wheel key and lug nuts kits are available for vehicles with    and  lug wheels we offer wheel locks and lug nuts in every style including cone seat bulge cone seat radiusball seat and shank style we also have spline drive lug nuts engineered to fit the smaller recesses in many wheels openended lug nuts designed for racing vehicles with longer wheel studs and to handle the high shock loads encountered in racing highstrength wheel studs in a range of lengths made from heattreated chrome moly and of course we also offer a large selection of lug bolts and boltstyle locks for vehicles so equippedfeatured
