replies rebranding thoughts from a republican about election there has been some talk of “rebranding” the republican party it’s an interesting concept can you “rebrand” a political party they tried that didn’t they at the convention trotting out a bunch of faces that looked different than the old white republican men my old boss sergio zyman used to say that “the best way to build a big brand is to sell a bunch of stuff” stuff  product not packaging rebranding the republican party might be a bigger job than the pundits think but it’s likely a necessary one what sergio meant was that consumers contact with the product is the primary experience that forms consumers’ concept of the brand we often said this in response to clients that were asking for a new brand advertising campaign as a way to turn a company’s fortunes around i always liked to start with the basics – the five p’s positioning product price place promotion if the republicans want to rebrand they will have to go through the same process i can think of two times in the recent past that republicans have rebranded sorry reaganites but the s were not one of them the first time the republicans rebranded was when it was done to them not by them in the election of  when the kennedy’s embraced martin luther king and civil rights the party of lincoln became the party of unequal rights – a positioning it embraced with nixon’s southern strategy and 5 years of votes since then the party rebranded again in  with nixon’s impeachment trial when the moderate eisenhower republicans were driven out in an attempt to circle the wagons for a failed presidency the key message here is that rebranding can often be a traumatic event or the result of a traumatic event but most importantly it requires changes in the product in this case policies and legal action rebranding the republican party if it can be done will require a lot more than putting some different hued and accented people in front of the camera rebranding the republican party will mean holding true to the ideals of the party but adjusting the policy platform to meet the current rational and emotional needs of voters if we’re smart that will be republican libertarian conservative and independent voters – everyone just slightly right of the liberal democrat party for example if republicans want women to vote for them they cannot have policy platforms or candidates who declare that women’s bodies have magical properties that can prevent pregnancy or that a woman must go through a dangerous medical procedure pregnancy because she was the victim of a crime obama’s negative advertising casting romney republicans as uncaring rich guys who fire workers dislike contraception and cut needed government programs to give money to the rich worked in part because some republicans were out in public looking like old white men and saying those exact things sometimes conservative media will ridicule a story in mass media that turns out not to be completely true in its detail but emotional true to many people think tawana brawley or duke lacrosse team unfortunately it is completely normal for people to be ruled by their emotions and to take rational facts and twist them or disbelieve them if it contradicts their deeply held beliefs so long as there are fits and gasps of racism or sexism emerging from the party that embraced sexism and racism in the ’s for many people who haven’t shared a republican life experience those little fits and gasps make it much easier to emotionally believe false narratives like that used by the obama campaign in  brands are a bundle of rational and emotional attributes when seeking to rebrand you have to consider both the intended meanings of a word a color or an action as well as the unintended meaning that an offtarget audience might feel if you think that you can manage the reactions of that offtarget group – that’s fine charge right ahead but if you think you might have some sympathetic members in your own group to the offtarget reaction then you have a problem groupon found this out with their superbowl add that angered tibet’s supporters in the us a group that i think includes a lot of women – a prime target of groupon’s coupons the changes in policy that the republican party must consider should be vetted both against their deeply held beliefs as well as the potential interpretations by independents and specific demographic groups can the republicans rebrand i don’t know i do like the idea of a third party instead of rebranding maybe republicans should be left alone to be republicans it seems like we already have a third party in the us – its composed of independents all they need is an organization that can raise funds and set priorities i think it would be great to have three parties in congress then when committee seats are assigned no group would have a supermajority and there would have to be comprise which i think would result in things getting done however let’s start with the assumption that republicans i am registered as a republican want to rebrand the effort needs to start with the party getting people together to seriously think about how to translate the party’s principles into the modern era that probably will require a combination shifting funding from advertising to thinking – more think tanks working on the right policy issues with national and statelevel idea sessions working from the reality on the ground in demographics in ideas in economics and in current law to gain a new consensus of what it means to be a republican once we get the product right then we work on promoting it one final sergio story about that we must always remember that promotion is intended to influence the masses therefore it must speak to the masses not to the elite few who fund it sergio used to tell a story about roberto goizueta yes he was a great leader calling him in to review some advertising after watching the tv ad he said that his wife had seen it and didn’t like it sergio answered “that is good because it’s not for her there are very few of her and many many of the people it is intended to influence” if the republicans want to make it easy for women minorities and youth to vote for their candidates they will have to rebrand the party must clearly break from its past in a way that rings true in the hearts of its members that fall into those demographics that means news ideas not new principals new candidates ones that can be trusted not to say stupid things about gender race or work ethic – they can still be white but they must have true experience living as a nonwhite nonmale nonwealthy member of american society and most importantly new policies how the rnc data torpedo blasted the ss romney leave a reply i spent the last four days of the  presidential campaign knocking on doors sorting campaign fliers and manning the phones in the call center i knew something was wrong with the romney campaignrnc data when they dropped me off in my first neighborhood on my first day – more on that later as the election results show obama knew what people to focus on and the republicans let the loose poll data fool them about who was listening on my first day walking the streets and knocking on doors to get out the vote gotv – which i thought was some online video channel at first i admit the van dropped me off with a map and a clip board with sheet full of names and little bubbles next to them like an sat test i was excited how hightech we had scan codes for each person and then we were going to bubble in their responses i was told we were going to neighborhoods that had lots of registered republicans but their turnout in  was lower than the average we asked the people who opened the door our sheets had the name of every registered republican voter in the house if they planned to vote for romney and what time they would go to the polls the rumor was that orca would let the autodialers feed them into the call schedule after  noon if they hadn’t been to the polls we bubbled in their responses i imagine after i turned the sheets in they would be scanned and all this great data would go into the system and drive a massive personalized gotv campaign there seemed to be a small problem the first neighborhood i was dropped off in was section  housing “wow” i thought surprised that this group was registered republican not surprised they didn’t vote for mccain palin except it wasn’t true almost immediately it became clear that  the people on my list didn’t live behind the doors i was knocking on  the people on my list that did live at the address were not planning on voting for romney  i didn’t have enough bubbles to accurately record what i was finding so i’m sure those same people got phone calls later later as we walked through other neighborhoods where there were a lot more republicans and a few more people who planned to vote for romney i still had the same problem the data i had was  wrong and there was no way to bubble in that many had already voted i talked to some people the next day who had early voted but still got six plus calls on election day to get out and vote i had other complaints – including that the door hangars were too flimsy and in comparison to obama lit not that interesting and not that tailored to helping people get to the polls so maybe it was just the walking lists that had weak data nope same thing in the call center lots of disconnected numbers deceased or incapacitated people very sad talking to the family members and having to ask “yes sorry to hear about the alzheimer’s but did they get the chance to absentee vote” and many many obama voters once again there was an electronic system for recording the results but it didn’t have all the choices i would like including the early vote answer it seems to me that not being able to record early votes just leads to wasted resources chasing people who already voted and possibly annoying them in ways that hurt the campaign good data is hard to find i noticed something that seemed odd to me from the obama campaign in the last weeks a big push to gets “likes” for the campaign i thought at first it was silly then i thought some more a facebook “like” gives the app a lot of data about the “liker” if you can ingest that data you could learn a lot from  people plus you can push “free” advertising messages into their news feeds to their likeminded friends that’s a smart strategy it’s not what it seems romney ryan did with facebook all i got in my news stream was more requests to “like” wasted chance finally there was the vaunted orca effort at romney ryan you can read about that debacle here httpwwwbreitbartcombiggovernmentorcahowtheromneycampaignsuppresseditsownvote net net the rnc needs to get serious about voter data in the modern era there is lots and lots of data available not only do you need to have it so you can husband your resources and spend better with effective media and contact targeting httpthehillcomblogshilliconvalleytechnology66datadroveobamasgroundgame you need it to craft messages and contacts that are relevant and appreciated by voters there were many romney voters who told me to go away or hung up just because they were tired of the multiple contacts without clear calls to action i am dying to get at the data collected through this past campaign and work on it to get a clean dataset and then work with the party to put messages out and make contacts that will help make the republican brand meaningful relevant and acceptable to the voters that we need to win national office breakin’ or fakin’ romney’s way leave a reply my old partner sergio zyman had a marketing theory about momentum he took it from some hedge fund guys in its simplest expression he used it to explain why it was easy to sell two more cokes to someone who already drank four cokes a day then it was to sell one more coke to a person that only drank one soda a day consumption creates momentum at an individual and group level it makes the product more acceptable we never did figure out how to build an algorithm we could use to predict sales increases from momentum but scott miller and craig binkley did help pepsi of all places figure out how to build momentum for their core brand in any case it looks like romney ryan  has momentum going for it and it doesn’t look like obama’s performance the other night did a lot to slow it done today the drudge report is trumpeting that the real clear politics average shows romney with an electoral college lead for the first time in the race he also has the lead in the popular vote polls romney takes first lead in electoral college… major garret noticed that it may be the obama campaign is giving up on a few swing states httpwwwnationaljournalcompoliticswhatsnextintheobamaromneyduel if they are it might be a sign that money is getting tight in the campaign or i might just think that because i got so many emails from the obama campaign over the past week reminding me that my total donation balance is  in addition to a five email flurry last night telling me about an fec deadline i’d never heard of before take a look at the rcp statebystate tracker for the big group of potential swing states obama looks to have lost significant ground in every state from where he stood in  when we had one of the highest democrat party voter turnouts in the modern era we all have noticed that broadbased enthusiasm for obama seems down from  now the polls are showing it httpwwwrealclearpoliticscomepollspresidentelectionselectoralcollegemaphtml karl rove and others are making the case that romney lead in the polls may represent an insurmountable lead in the polling booth httpwwwrealclearpoliticscomvideorovenocandidatewhohasledwith5ofmoreinlikelyvoterpollinmidoctoberhaslosthtml one other point of interest i waited in line for  mins to vote early yesterday that is as long as i normally wait to vote on election day and the staff and facility was basically the same remember obama’s strategy is to make romney an unacceptable candidate and everyday romney is ahead in the polls that job is harder about last night    leave a reply last night was a classic example of american democracy two very powerful men going headtohead in a battle of wits answering directly to voters and inconsistently tweaked by the th estate httpfoxnewsinsidercom6videorecapmoderatorcandycrowleysmanyattemptstoreinincandidatesduringhofstradebate the format works brit hume and others suggested the commission on presidential debates may want to rethink this format httpwwwfoxnewscomopinion6deardebatecommissionifwontkilloffthissillytownhallformat but i think it worked we got a good view of each man – what facts and logic they think make a good argument for something how they communicate their proposed policies and how they multitask  swinging from a facetoface argument with a competitor to a caring engagement with a citizen on a new topic neither candidate seemed to fall apart and there were not a lot of “gotchas” and “zingers” despite my earlier claim that the debates had been reduced to producing sound bites need balanced questions and moderator there are adjustments that will probably help i like the idea of going to a swing state or at least a swing county in an attempt to get more balance in the questions – this might be addressed by including more balance in the process of question selection in addition to submission it seems there was a misstep by the moderator as well stepping into the argument on libya to act as a fact checker that shouldn’t happen and to tell the truth that seemed a little “prearranged” to me it was a likely question so i would expect the candidate’s to be prepared but i think it was odd that the moderator seemed to have the exact right quote available to support the president’s claim  look we all know the president’s campaign staff sends material to reporters including the moderator to support their claims but she seemed just a little too ready to support the president’s statement – i wonder how much specific contact on that item there was before the debate httpwwwhuffingtonpostcomcandycrowleylibyafactcheckbacktracknhtmlutmhprefpoliticsirpolitics in the end the president’s claim reminds me a bit of a story about mark twain once after attending a church service he told the minister how much he liked the sermon he said “i enjoyed it as an old friend i have a book at home containing every word of it” the minister was offended and said “i am sure you have not” and twain said “indeed i have” the minister asked him to send the book over and the next day twain sent him a dictionary president obama did indeed says the word “terror” in the same speech where referred to the attack in benghazi – but the relationship between the two is not clear still a horse race the clear winner in this debate is the voter we got to see our potential future presidents at work in a situation we can reasonable expect them to be in – arguing for their policy with congress their staff and other world leaders pundits and polls claim success for both candidates – obama certainly didn’t lose like he did the first debate but it isn’t clear who influenced the key voting groups undecided voters in swing states a good portion of which are women the most but there is some evidence romney won on the economy httpnationfoxnewscompresidentialdebatescbspostdebatepollromneywallopsobamaeconomy a key issue with those voters romney 5 obama 6 among likely voters leave a reply romney 5 obama 6 among likely voters nice headline for romney going into tonights debate it suggests obama’s task making romney unacceptable to voters might be a little harder than axelrod thought maybe its time for the president to put forward a clear second term agenda other than raising taxes on the  da batess good news for candidate superfans leave a reply what did you think of the vp debate i was reminded of the snl skit with the chicago bears mike ditka superfans sitting around the table drinking beer smoking cigars eating ribs and shouting “da bears” in selfcongratulations at least that’s what i thought of when i watched joe biden whose predictions were likewise exaggerated and mannerisms equally ludicrous that isn’t necessarily a bad thing the role of debates the roles of presidential and vp candidate debates has morphed over the years just as the role of the national party conventions they have become more political theater and less working session but they haven’t changed as much as we might think one hundred and fifty four years ago lincoln debated douglas they certainly had a different format – one candidate spoke for  minutes then the second candidate spoke for  minutes and the first candidate rejoinered for  minutes talk about an opportunity for speechifying instead of addressing the issues on the minds of the people as represented by the press in a time when there wasn’t a national mass media those debates served to get the word out in general in addition to seeing the candidates in action as individuals today newspaper magazines tv and the internet help candidates get the word out on candidate positions and the televised debates have become more of a “disqualifying” event loaded with gotchas and zingers a few notes on history though debates and even the tradition of presidential candidate campaigning in person are a relatively new practice garfield harrison and mckinley campaigned from their front porches doing sitdown discussion and short speeches to whoever showed up at their house afterall the lincolndouglas debates happened before lincoln was the party’s nominee once lincoln was in the process of running for the nomination though his backers turned many of lincoln’s event into pure political theater following lincoln around with troops of men carrying pieces of fence rail they claimed that the selfmade man lincoln had split himself with a banner reading ‘abe lincoln the rail splitter’ by all reports lincoln practiced a little more humility and dignity than biden but made the same claim to being an “average joe” debates have always been one part explanation of positions and many parts political theater what about the presidential and vp debates the candidates are going into the debates with very simply objectives for the first presidential debate romney wanted to turn the race by demonstrating he is a knowledgeable caring presidential man obama just didn’t want to blow his lead by giving the press earned media a meme to obsesses on and drive the public dialogue my personal theory on the campaigns is that romney’s campaign believes there are fewer people that want to vote for obama than there was four years ago and all they need to do is prove romney a viable alternative the obama campaign’s theory seems to be similar when it comes to voters but their plan for winning is to get the base out to vote and make romney an unacceptable alternative to the undecided on those grounds romney won the first debate in the post debate obamabiden used the claim that romney lied as a way to confuse the undecided and keep their votes uncommitted romney tried to drive home his “acceptability” in large measure by winning in the polls and pushing that story the polls are a large factor in proving competence and acceptability if obama can’t get the lead back in the polls which include the opinions of a bunch of people who won’t vote before the election he will lose – the voting will follow the polls in the vp debate then joe wanted to rile up the hard support the diehard voters scott miller has always said would go out in a snow storm to vote for their party’s candidate he also wanted to keep up the “romney lies” meme research has shown that for the undecided thinking a candidate lies is confusing and stops them from committing obamabiden wants to keep “romney lies”  in the dialogue until they can show that obama wants to win can win and is a competent president ryan’s goal in the debate was to reinforce that romney is a “knowledgeable caring presidential man” and that ryan is competent enough to be vp and potential president this time both candidates seemed to achieve their goal although biden’s antics seemed to have turned off some women voters and ryan meekness left some voters wondering the next two debates the charactertures will continue in the next two debates with romney hammering obama’s competence and obama hammering romney on his “acceptability” i’m not sure the debates are where the action will be it looks like the battle is moving to earned media and will be centered on the death of america’s ambassador to libya and romney’s tax returns and behavior as bain capital’s founder i wouldn’t be surprised if the obama campaign had two or three more october surprises out there – these surprises don’t have to be  true to be effective as we have learned over the years some things can be “emotionally” true even if they are mostly or entirely factually false as every other pundit has noted we have a horse race       obama clinton rift over libya – the end  reply  was hillary’s year remember that bill and hillary put in all that time together so that she could be the first female president and then this guy came along    a guy who they gave a break to a guy who should be carrying their bags when talking about obama’s first run bill clinton said “give me a break this whole thing is the biggest fairy tale i’ve ever seen” — jan   addressing obama’s record on iraq during a new hampshire stop will the death of a us ambassador since it was an act of terror within an existing war between radical islam and us led christian democracy i won’t call it a murder cause the final rift in the compromise relationship between clinton and obama that’s what some pundits are suggesting the obama white house seems intent on putting the blame for the lack of security at the us facility in benghazi on hillary and the state dept instead of the dysfunctional nsc they created when they made a political hack tom donilon the national security adviser httpwwwnytimescomuspoliticstomdonilonamanagerofoverseascriseshtmlpagewantedall after firing a truly great american and well qualified former us

target in this interview httpvideofoxbusinesscomv65 look for the libya defeat and coverup news story to grow the obama administration valarie jarrett his defacto chief of staff tries not to make boot mistakes so the attempt to whitewash the attack in libya surely means there is more their than meets the eye – and it’s getting to be too juicy a story for even the mainstream media to ignore look for it to grow as they connect the dots between obama’s missed security briefings his unqualified national security staff their ridiculous claims that a bunch of speeches have tamed the world and the amateurish coverup attempt valarie jarret’s achiles heel has always been that she thinks you can throw the military the intelligence community and the democrat party led by bill clinton let’s be serious under the bus because they are afraid to cross obama his performance failure at the first debate put a chill in everyone’s spine – he is not infalliable and he could lose – and despite the rallied support of pundits and such for the biden debate it isn’t clear bill has obama’s back let’s remember without bill the dnc was a bust httpwwwhuffingtonpostcomobamaconventionbouncenhtml what
