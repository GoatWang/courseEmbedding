jason  weiss engineering ltd weiss asia jason cd transportdownload images hires the jason cd transport we conceived with the goal to play the music from a cd in a most transparent way and at the same time support the da converter connected to the jason transport for optimum playback quality we think we succeeded with the jason you won’t look back at any other cd playback solution   our renowned medus da converter complements the jason cd transport for a truly state of the art cd playback system the design and electronics are of the same high quality in both units we included many features in the jason which make it the cd transport of choice not only in conjunction with the medus but for all kinds of da convertersthe jason supports upsampling of the khz signal to  khz or  khz a digital level control via the remote control unit is also built in the dac feature can be switched on to optimize the sonic quality with da converters which have a jitter problem and as a consequence may give compromising sonic results   a display informs about the track number played the selected sampling frequency the absolute polarity of the output signal the audio volume the mute status and the dac feature setting   the ir remote control allows to control all features mentioned above and in addition can set the display brightness “i wish to thank you for providing me with the opportunity to share your engineering expertise as manifest in the perfection of the jason i cannot contemplate ever replacing it in my system it is the finest piece of electronics i have experienced in the  years i have been an audiophile” robert r nowinski usamain features mechanics  the jason uses a highquality toploader transport system a heavyduty motor driven lid protects the cd and also safely puts the puck onto the cd upon closure the motor is of the same swiss brand as nasa is using for their mars mobiles the jason employs a twin metal frame the inner chassis is made of steel and acts as a very effective shield against electrostatic and electromagnetic radiation the outer frame is made of massive anodized aluminium for additional shielding resulting in optimal heat convection and beautiful looks the four feet have been designed for optimum vibration and shock absorption   transportthe jason uses the renowned philips cdprom transport as its core unit the master clock for the cdprom unit is generated by our own clock circuitry   power supplya powerful nonswitching power supply is used all sensitive voltages have their own regulators the power switch activates a semiconductor relay which only switches on or off at zero crossings of the mains voltage this assures a glitch free power switching   synchronizationan internal high precision and low jitter clock generator generates all clocking signals including those necessary for the cdprom transport   upsampling wordlength reduction jitter processing the jason contains an upsampler feature which allows the basic  khz bit data stream of the cd to be upsampled to  khz or  khz for subsequent da conversion our own state of the art algorithms for the upsampling as used by many of our professional studio customers are put to work   since the upsampling process has the effect of generating a wordlength longer than  bits a  bit floating point format is used this is then reduced in its wordlength to fit the standard aesebu or spdif formats this wordlength reduction uses the powr  algorithm powr is the defacto standard in professional audio for wordlength reduction powr has been developed by the “powr consortium llc” where weiss engineering ltd is one of the four member companies the output wordlength can be selected between   or  bits which allows the connection of a wide variety of da converters to the jason   the jason uses a special method to treat the output signal so that jitter generated in subsequent cables or da converters has less influence on the audio quality this allows da converters with

greece jason and medea an epic but doomed love story full of murder and magic also a play by euripides medea was king aeetes of colchis daughter and a great sorceress when jason and his argonautes arrived at the colchis court in search of the famed golden rams fleece jason was charged with seemingly impossible tasks to be granted the fleece with medeas magic jason obtained the fleece regardless and promptly escaped with her and her younger brother absyrtis the king in hot pursuit medea killed and dismembered her own brother to slow down the pursuers who were honorbound to collect the body parts for a proper funeral while medea bore jason two children in exile he eventually abandoned her in favor of the king of corinths daughter medea extracted due revenge by poisoning the new bride and killing her own children to spite the father in short plenty of sex and violence nothing much seems to have changed since when it comes to telling saucy tales that hold an audience enthralled perhaps thats why swiss proaudio firm weiss named its first consumer audio products jason and medea it suggests spellbinding results full of juice and passion led by white magician daniel weiss  weiss is german for white  his design dna goes back to studer revox in whose digital audio lab he worked for five year designing sample rate converters and dsp code for digital audio recorders he launched weiss engineering in  to focus on digital audio equipment for mastering studios  ad and da converters equalizers dynamic processors sampling rate converters and such clients of his pro kit include abbey road bmg emi telarc teldec sony warner and audiophile celebrities like bob ludwig and bernie grundman to name just a few for a more comprehensive list click here sleek of low profile and with very clean and simple lines the weiss consumer cosmetics are reminiscent of fellow swiss company orpheus ie timeless uncluttered and an antidote to the nouveauriche glitz pursued in the audio jewelry sector the professional mastering studio background meanwhile recalls ed meitners emm labs this spells nocompromise tech it caters specifically to top professionals who dont mind committing murder to the checkbook to secure the ultimate tools for their trade craft if daniel weiss was first and foremost a consumer audio provider he couldnt justify this kind of heavy inhouse rd dwindling sales for stateoftheart redbook consumer machines dont pay for proprietary custom solutions in the dsp arena no its the professional recording engineers who subsidize the highend arm of weiss pro still final retail pricing remains an olympian  for the combo echoes of golden fleecing from ancient greece weiss would point at handmade in suisse for perspective instead based on their proarena dac the medea dac was introduced in  it was duly greeted with fanfare in the audiophile glossies it also measured like a dream the newer jason saw the light of day in  to date it lacks any english reviews though one each in german dutch and chinese is on record as youd expect from its profile weiss engineering is big on accuracy in digital accuracy depends on equal sampling of the signal every  microseconds wrong time spacing of these samples creates jitter which becomes most audible in the higher frequencies where wave forms are steeper hello digital glare besides the ad and da conversion processes asynchronous sample rate conversion used during varispeed modes of digital audio recorders for example can also introduce jitter ie inaccurate sample timing further jitter sources during da conversion include power supply crosstalk from spindle or servo motors capacitive or inductive crosstalk between clock signals microphony of the samplerate crystal clock generator and the connecting cables with external units such as are under consideration the received data also has to be syncd with the send clock in the transport for the most obvious source of jitter the weiss jason with its motordriven lid  its disc clamp is conveniently fitted to it  employs the philips cdprom transport and sports userselectable upsampling to  and khz incidentally the swiss company which supplied the lift motor also supplied motors for the nasa mars rover word length of course increases with upsampling engaged here it can be trimmed at the outputs from  bits down to  and  bits for dacs like my bit zanden which wont lock to anything else wordlength reduction from the bit floating point length is accomplished via the powr  algorithm thats short for psychoacoustically optimized wordlength reduction and was developed by a consortium of four companies including weiss the others are millennia media zsystems and lake systems apparently it is the standard in professional recording studios as well as with apple computer the dac function on the remote engages spread spectrum technologies to optimize the signal in the jitter domain when used with converters of lesser jitter rejection it has the purpose of covering discrete jitter frequencies  which can be present in less than optimum dac designs  with a broad band jitter spectrum this in effect produces a broader or flatter jitter spectrum which results in reduced jitterinduced distortions jitter is therefore turned into broadband white noise and much less detrimental to the sonic quality than discrete jitter frequencies would be like the medea the jason employs a dualchassis construction with the inner chassis of steel for superior shielding the outer chassis of aluminum for heat convection additional shielding and appearance jasons connectivity bay includes  digital outputs  rca and toslink fixed at khz rca bnc xlr and st optical at either   or khz and twinned xlrs at  and khz muted at khz theres also the ubiquitous iec power inlet and a usb port for future software upgrades via downloads the included custom aluminum remote has a few doublefunction buttons whose lesserused commands are accessed by pressing the alt button first those include sample rate and word length options which youll likely only set once during initial setup the remote also controls volume absolute phase and display brightness the former two manipulated in the dsp domain like the upsampling ie external to the commercial converter chip the mains voltage can be changed by prying off the iec cover and turning the internal drum to the desired value the weiss medea converter uses a dual phaselockloop said to be unusually effective into subsonic frequencies where conventional plls begin to lose accuracy below khz like jason medea performs its upsampling  here necessary to allow for a shallower more phasebenign rdorder reconstruction filter  mostly in the external dsp domain the  x oversampling dacs run at khz and a class a output stage with massively paralleled transistors for nearly zero output impedance   ohms to be precise  follows the converter stage several reclocking schemes are combined to minimize jitter while a proprietary mrcs mutual relation correlation system circuit lowers the sn ratio of the converter yet further incoming signal from a disc spinner can be locked at      and khz for connectivity the medea offers four frontpanel selectable digital inputs carried in parallel on both xlr and rca one toslink for a total of eight analog outputs appear on both rca and xlr no servos employed output voltage level can be trimmed with dualmono frontpanel pots and a supplied screw driver higain or logain mode are selected on the rear panel max output voltage is dbu for rcaxlr respectively upsampling jitter reduction and deemphasis are once again handled in the dsp domain no hdcd processing is included with the different upsampling options between jason and medea i asked daniel for some clarification upsampling basically can be done anywhere between the  output of the cd transport and the dac modern dacs usually have some upsampling built in to relax the requirements for the analog reconstruction filter after the dac the upsampling process is in essence a digital lowpass filter and its quality is crucial to the overall quality of the transporttodac chain by performing the upsampling in our jason transport we have control over the quality of that process independent of the type of dac connected if our medea dac connects to the jason the user can choose between various types of upoversampling schemes depending on preference these are jason none medea dsp to  medea dac chip to   jason to  medea dsp none medea dac chip to   and jason to  medea dsp none medea dac chip to  technically the most critical part is the  to  upsampling on the subject of which commercial silicon handles conversion duties daniel reserved the right not to be specific he explained that he didnt want any discussions of his medea dac to center on preconceived notions over certain chips he also wants the freedom to switch suppliers if and when this improves performance  if this were marketing propaganda we would spin incessantly hear it on the equipment that was used to record your music and if it was the choice for the performing and recording artists shouldnt it be yours which truly doesnt take much spin if you really want to hear just what remains hidden in the groove code of your silver discs top shelf professional kit ought to retrieve it therein lies the potential rub though from professional monitors by pmc and klein  hummel to source gear by dcs or benchmark media audiophiles often claim such kit to be too neutral too clinical or sterile to serve the music the test bench meanwhile responds regularly with superb linearity graphs for just such gear to underline the old dichotomy truth and beauty clearly audiophiles must pay at least lip service to data honesty how else to retain their memberships in club high fidelity yet when the gavel comes down many judge in favor of less honesty they desire more musicality thats everyones favorite weasel word recording engineers need microscopic honesty they would tell us that we need the same  if we are truly serious about hearing their work rather than editorialize it arbitrarily and to editorialize it with conscious choice of course would rely on intimate familiarity with the untouched source code since we werent present during the recording session we cannot thus the issue is both mute and unresolved the question is do we really want the truth can we handle it like the judge in the pornography case we claim we know musicality when we seehear it even though were otherwise mostly incapable of defining it based on the proarena connection the exclusive pricing and the longevity of the company and its resident engineering department technical excellence at the edge of the art seems pretty much a given how would all that translate though to decidedly nontechnical ears that dont give a twit about specs and theory weiss jason cd transport engine by igetwebcom ���ҧ���� ����   ��¡�������   home   products   how to

output the upsampled signal it is reduced in its wordlength to fit the standard aesebu or spdif formats this wordlength reduction uses the powr   algorithm which is one of the best wordlength reduction schemes widely used in pro audio equipment the output wordlength can be selected between   and  bits which allows to hook up a wide variety of da converters to the jason da converter enhancementthe jason uses a specific method spread spectrum technology to treat the output signal such that the clocking quality of the subsequent da converter does not have much influence on the

olsher  jan th  categories digitaltoanalog converters  products weiss engineering jason take a cleaver and hack a cd player into two functional halves what you end up with is a transport and a digitaltoanalog converter dac is that really necessary is there a good reason to break an integrated cd player which is bound to be a more costeffective design into two pieces the most compelling reason is flexibility—the ability to experiment with new dac designs as digital technology continues to evolve having lived with the jason for some time now i am convinced that a good transport is essential to laying the foundation for a sonically superior digital front end the notion popular in some circles that a good dac can overcome the limitations of a mediocre transport gets crushed by the jason but then this is no ordinary transport the weiss engineering jason was built without compromise in either electronics or software to partner with not only weiss’ own medea dac but any dac or digital amplifier out there at the jason’s core is the impressive philips cdprom toploader mechanism push the “eject” button and a motor drive lifts a heavyduty lid push it again and the lid closes while securely capturing the cd as with the medea the chassis consists of a twin frame the inner steel chassis provides an effective shield against electrostatic and electromagnetic fields while the outer anodized aluminum frame is responsible mainly for heat convection and the unit’s elegant cosmetics attention to detail is abundant all sensitive voltages have dedicated regulators the power switch activates a solidstatebased relay which only switches on or off at zero crossings of the mains voltage ensuring glitchfree power switching an internal lowjitter clock generates all clocking signals including those required for the cdprom transport in order to ensure maximum compatibility with khzbit or khzbit dacs the khzbit signal from the cdprom may be optionally upsampled to khz or khz when upsampling is engaged the output wordlength can be set to   or  bits to accommodate the wordlength requirement of the partnering dac wordlength reduction to   or  bits is performed via proprietary onboard digital signal processing using the powr dithering algorithm which is the de facto standard in professional audio for this operation in the case of the medea dac or any other dac which can accept any of the jason’s outputs it is possible to experiment with the various upsampling options to determine which sounds best in the context of a particular system the medea’s onboard dsp upsamples  to khz while its dac chip upsamples  and khz input to khz thus for jason and medea users the critical step of upsampling from  to khz may be performed either by the jason or the medea according to designer daniel weiss some users prefer the khzbit output from the jason and i can understand why for a single cable connection eg jason aesebu output  into medea input  i absolutely positively preferred khzbit settings however for a dual aesebu cable connection jason output  feeding inputs  and  on the medea khzbit was definitely king image outlines became more robust soundstage depth perspective was enhanced in a nutshell the music flowed with greater microdynamic conviction and analoglike spatiality timbre accuracy the cornerstone of musical realism was exceptional the jason also incorporates an optional dac circuit whose goal it is to mask discrete jitter frequencies with wideband noise this spreadspectrum technology is based on the premise that raising a dac’s noise floor is sonically benign while discrete jitter frequencies are not with the medea as the partnering dac activating the dac circuit made no audible difference during my listening tests weiss does believe however that it would help inferior dacs perform better the remote control deserves special mention it’s solidly built and provides complete control over all of the jason’s functions including selection of sampling rate and wordlength the jason’s degree phase inversion function is worth writing home about the ability to invert signal polarity on the fly is essential to maximizing sound quality during cd playback the ubiquitous multitrack recording process whereby  or more tracks are being mixed down to as few as two stereo tracks almost guarantees that one or more tracks in the mix are reversed in polarity and the situation may differ from track to track quickly checking the  and degree settings on the fly makes it extremely convenient to select the best sounding setting for a particular track generally speaking one setting gives the most focused image outlines and is the criterion i use for setting polaritythe main focus of this review is the jason since the medea already earned a tas golden ear award from jv in  however i felt it important to reunite these protagonists in order to experience weiss engineering’s best digital front end the medea uses the analog devices ad chipset in mono mode the ad is a bitkhz multibit sigmadelta dac introduced around  it continues a minor design trend i have noted over the past several years of giving preference to older dac chipsets to be perfectly honest even vintage s dac chips were already sporting incredible dynamic range the relevant technical stories in recent years have been jitter reduction more benign digital and analog filters and the significant reduction of digital artifacts and brightnessin the past it has been easy for me to divide digital front ends into two distinct camps on the one hand there were the singlebit sigmadelta dacs that at their worst were harsh and grainy sounding and at their best only mildly bright and grainy on the other end of the spectrum were the multibit dacs that sounded pretty much defanged but also as if they had undergone a frontal lobotomy being boring dynamically this was not the sort of polite sound i could fall in love with and at the end of the day i would be willing to accept a bit of textural grit for the sake of convincing microdynamics enter the jason and medea now there’s no longer the need for any such concession harmonic textures were remarkably pure totally nondigital sounding it’s ironic that  years after the introduction of the cd and digital recording one of the highest compliments i could pay a digital component is to label it analoglike but my musical values are closely aligned with analog sound’s forte of smooth textures microdynamic passion and stable image outlines in the case of the jason and medea my listening notes added up mostly to a litany of “no’s” no harmonic grain no hypedup upper octaves no digital artifacts no monotonous microdynamics in fact the music’s kinetic energy was propelled forward with a veritable “soul train” of emotions timbre accuracy was exceptional each instrument being portrayed with believable tone and harmonic bloom performance at the frequency extremes is critically dependent on the associated speaker but when the rest of the system was finely tuned i can safely state that bass lines were full tight and in time with the upper octavestransients unfolded with startling clarity and precision on the flip side the decay of musical lines was resolvable in breathtaking fashion down to a velvety black background there was simply no veiling of the music’s tapestry as a consequence a wealth of lowlevel detail was revealed as if observing the soundstage though a microscope yet the overall presentation remained quite natural my favorite analogy to explain precisely what i mean is that it was like observing a school of fish in an aquarium most of the time it was the ensemble that captured my attention but it was always possible to focus in on a specific instrumentthe medea uses a solidstate class a output stage that features exceptionally low output impedance and allows it to drive long interconnect runs without a problem the output stage’s distortion figures are very low how low you might ask well apparently the medea’s distortion figures are predominantly driven by the da converter and not by the output stage yet the output stage did imprint its solidstate character upon the soundstage that much was immediately obvious in a direct confrontation with the primaluna eight cd player make no mistake about it the weiss engineering front end was much purersounding than the primaluna but it lacked the latter’s palpable imagery and soundstage depth to be fair it’s obviously a case of transistors versus tubes most listeners will agree that tubes portray a soundstage with greater spatiality i’ve been asked why that is and i can’t say that i have a definitive answer it may well be a consequence of a tube’s inherent distortion spectrum and i’m willing to accept that as a means to an end since in the final analysis i’m after the illusion of “live” and the gestalt of listening to a musical ensemble is typically much stronger with tubesthere were still two more configurations to audition first having the jason feeding my favorite underk dac the altmann micro machines’ attraction dac and second using the primaluna eight cd player as a transport with its digital output connected to the medea the attraction dac is the only zeroupsampling dac to my knowledge that can accept a bitkhz datastream in addition to bitkhz with the jason it was obviously possible to try both sampling rates to my surprise i discovered that i actually preferred to upsample out of the jason at khz in this context the attraction’s mids were slightly sweeter than the medea’s but clearly lacked the latter’s resolving power and finally the medea was rather unhappy being coupled to the primaluna eight certainly a good dac can to some extent handle a lowerpedigree datastream but the resultant sound quality was well below the standard set by the jason hence the notion that a dac can fully overcome the limitations of an indifferent ie inexpensive transport bit the dust in these listening tests i was a bit skeptical initially about the importance of a good transport but no more the jason made a believer out of me i can now safely state that the even the best of dacs can benefit from a worldclass transport the jason’s blend of design excellence useful features purity of tone and intrinsic boogie factor catapults it to the head of the class coupled with the medea dac this is a digital front end that will recalibrate your expectations of cd sound quality bottom line i can’t think of a more enjoyable way to rediscover one’s cd
