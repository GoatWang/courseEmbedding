editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide since the early s surveys of it executives consistently ranked the development and operation of strategic information systems as a key management issue considerable prior research has been devoted to software development and preimplementation phases of the system development life cycle but only a few studies have investigated issues arising during the operational life of the system these studies have reported conflicting results and consequently offer little guidance to researchers and practitioners seeking to reduce the occurrence of operational failures in strategic information systems the goal of this research was to identify the key elements responsible for accidents during the operation of strategic information systems and identify the relationships if any among these elements indepth interviews were conducted with  chief information officers using the critical incident technique to gather information about  specific strategic information operating failures and these results were integrated with over  accident reports for a three year period from a major financial institution the data was analyzed using grounded theory methodology and the key elements responsible for strategic information system accidents were identified as four key variables qualified management support of the operations environment characterized by lack of funding lack of support for operations initiatives outside of the it department and perceived lack of it credibility weak it leadership characterized by passivity weak it staff evidenced by lack of troubleshooting ability and lack of operations information which results in confusion and delays during accident recovery other contributions of the research include applying safety system concepts to business information systems and creating and validating an accident classification framework changes by james d white book  editions published in

of strategies to create a smooth turnaround at jamba juice  smart business magazine smart business magazine linkedin facebook twitter google youtube rss search for northern california james d white found the right blend of strategies to create a smooth turnaround at jamba juice by sbn staff  am edt february  am edt june   when james d white came onboard with jamba juice co in december  same store sales dipped  percent and the company lost  million for the year the recession had prompted consumers to cut discretionary spending and smoothies just weren’t considered essential management created a road map to get the business back on track “we made a commitment that we’d effectively turn the company around in a threeyeartime horizon” says white chairman president and ceo “i’m happy to report that we completed the turnaround in  we registered our first year of profitability as a public company” that included a  percent increase in same store sales jamba juice remained profitable in  although same store sales were flat to slightly up here’s how white and jamba juice developed a plan and expanded offerings to set the stage for the turnaround   strategies for growth management needed to develop a plan that would allow jamba juice to grow and return to profitability within three years key to the turnaround was creating the blend plan which drove strategic choices that were made first up was facilitating fast growth through aggressive franchising and a move away from the core portfolio of companyowned stores “by  we were in the middle of refranchising or selling company stores to become more of a franchise model today roughly  percent of our locations are company owned” white says “that significant shift in the business model gave us the opportunity to accelerate growth leveraging local partners in specific geographies” jamba juice added more than  locations in the united states in  and expects to open  more this year currently there are more than  jamba juice stores across the country a second component of the blend plan addressed the product portfolio and the creation of more “better for you” products “we added products like steelcut oatmeal which has been a hit with consumers” white says “we added more fruits and vegetables to our smoothie lineup we also added more food items that pair well with the smoothies” vegetables like kale beets and cucumbers were added to the menu as items to be blended or juiced “those have become increasingly popular as consumers look to cleanse or add healthier onthego solutions to their diet” he says another component of the blend plan involved expanding into international markets — jamba juice went from zero to  international locations in a ½year span with the th store opening in early  jamba juice executives started the process by picking about a dozen potential markets to explore — including canada mexico south korea and the philippines — prioritizing them and then looking for partners “partners typically have an existing restaurant or retail holding that jamba juice would complement” white says “in south korea our partner spc group is a multibillion dollar company that runs  restaurants we have a commitment with them to build  locations in south korea over a decade” the company expects to hit the century mark in international locations before the end of  with a major focus in canada and the philippines “mexico is the fourth market where we have a commitment to build new stores we expect our first stores to open in mexico in early ” white says he expects jamba juice to have about  locations internationally in the next decade “a significant portion of agreements are lined up already with the first four initial markets we’ll announce other international markets this year which we’re excited about” he says a final piece of the blend plan was jambago which was piloted in schools to deliver healthier solutions for students whether selfservice or behind the counter the dispensers feature highquality smoothies white says while jambago remains heavily focused on schools the dispensers will also be located in target stores as part of a recently announced deal “target is a perfect fit for our brand there’s a good complement between the target brand and the jamba brand and an overlap of customers” he says keeping management focused having a focused agenda and continually refining it is a central part of the management philosophy at jamba juice focusing on core stores and core operations including the addition of new menu items resulted in ½ years of same store growth until a dip in the third quarter of  “but that was still at the top of our industry from a performance perspective” white says acknowledging that having a focused agenda was critical to the company’s growth management also refined the agenda on a regular basis although emphasis was placed on keeping it limited to only a handful of tasks “you tend to add more things to the agenda over time if you can keep a tighter agenda of three to five items that’s about all most management teams can focus on at one time” he says it’s also important to ensure that the right team with the necessary skills is in place to execute the plan — and tying that team to the key set of metrics that drive the overall growth strategy “one of the ways we were able to pull off the great success we’ve had over the last several years is being very aligned and very focused as a management team around the growth priorities” white says jamba juice is on what he calls version  of a threeyear strategic plan that guides choices made around the business which is broken down into annual operating plans that management reviews on a regular basis “we do that every week and it keeps us aligned both on the close shortterm quarterly milestones that need to be accomplished to deliver the annual plan but it also keeps us very tightly focused on the longerterm multiyear game plan” white says on a monthly or quarterly basis the team takes a more lengthy look at longerterm annual or multiyear strategies to see if any adjustments are needed to make sure resources are lined up behind growth initiatives with the highest rates of return “one example would be how we’ve recently taken several of our growth initiatives that would have been incubated in various parts of the company and formalized some of those and created standalone business units with their own sets of resources to maximize those opportunities” he says listening to customers jamba juice develops its strategy based on input from a variety of sources but always takes feedback from customers into account “we try to make sure to embed the voice of the customer in every choice every decision we make from the launch of our oatmeal platform to the work we’re doing around whole food blending and juicing” white says jambago for example was developed after talking to school administrators and parents who wanted better nutritional options for students but it’s not the only program that the company developed from listening to customers “earlier this year we launched the jamba first for kids platform which moms had been asking us to do for some time” white says jamba kids™ meals each contain ½ servings of fruits and vegetables and a serving of whole grains there are four smoothie options and two food choices — a pizza swirl and cheesy stuffed pretzel the kids menu has great growth potential according to white “the kids platform in our stores in growing and we’re thrilled about the work we’re doing in schools” he says white envisions jamba juice playing a leadership role in promoting nutrition for children and supporting parents with better choices for their youngsters “we just hosted a town hall related to healthy choices betterforyou products and physical fitness for kids in conjunction with the university of san francisco and the genyouth foundation” white says success of the kids platform launched because of consumer demand illustrates the importance of listening to customers “for most businesses particularly consumeroriented businesses you can’t ever have too much input from the consumer” white says that means mining various inputs available to marketers including social media to reach out and engage customers that can help shape how solutions and products are built “we talk a lot about big data and how to take all of the inputs whether that’s social media from various channels or other ways we reach out to the customers from a loyalty perspective” white says in addition to listening to customers jamba juice looks at trends worldwide “we try to integrate the ideas that make the most sense for the role we see ourselves playing in the world which is about making betterforyou greattasting products” he says the company takes consumer feedback global trends and other inputs and mixes them together in formulating strategy white sees opportunity for far more growth on the horizon “there is a fair amount of data to suggest that the consumer trend for healthier products investing more in the foods they put in their bodies from a healthy fuel perspective is moving well beyond a niche to a big mega trend that will really drive the marketplace moving forward” white says the premium juice category alone is a  billion business that has been growing annually at a rate of  to  percent he says “jamba juice is on the forefront of that moving forward” white says “we love the early response to the premium juice offering that we’re starting to roll out and we will accelerate the rollout of our whole food juicing and blending platform in ” ●   takeaways keep management agendas focused find good partners in international markets listen to

quality  value  meets expectations  there is more theology and doctrine related to this subject than one might initially think white and niell do an excellent job of defending the biblical view of marriage sex law and grace those who do not hold to the traditional view of homosexuality undermine the authority and inerrancy of scripture when trying to defend their position this book clearly defines and defends sound doctrine by using the grammaticalhistorical method of interpretation they even include quotes from the early church fathers on the subject this is a great resource was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate mandm age  gender female  stars out of  all christians need this book july   mandm age  gender female quality  value  meets expectations  to the point logical intelligent and loving this book will help christians and nonchristians understand what god has said about homosexuality was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate david r bess  stars out of  june   david r bess white here provides a very good response to the doctrine that claims a homosexual lifestyle and a christian lifestyle are compatible an increasing number of people today have succumbed to the line of thinking that there is some degree of homosexual activity that is acceptable to god white calmly sets the record straight misinterpreted gods stance on samesex activity partnerships and even marriagethis book would have received five stars but was only given four because of the authors wordiness the points he makes here could have been made in far fewer pages he also neglects the bigger picture behind the error of the homosexual camp failing to mention their replacement of gods propositional truth in the bible with mans experiential truth based on his own experiencestill this book is the best treatment i have read on this increasingly prevalent problem in todays society was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate roy ingle  stars out of  march   roy ingle dr white gives us a book that deals with the sin of homosexuality from gods word he doesnt give in to the cultural views or the changing morals of society but he stays true to the scriptures dr white opens every passage of scripture on homosexuality and gives a biblical defense against this sin was this review helpful helpful votes yes   no  flag as inappropriate jim mimidis  stars out of  may   jim mimidis i just finished reading the book and have found it very helpful in giving me an understanding of both the revisionists perspectives on the practice of homosexuality as well as the proper biblical response to those who would claim that a same sex lifestyle is condoned by god thanks james white for once again enlightening the truth
