acquire and operate highquality distribution warehouses that are leased to corporate customers black creek industrial reit iv inc’s sec filings including its current prospectus can be accessed here this offering is not being made in ohio property depicted in photograph is owned by industrial property trust inc ipt which is an investment program affiliated with direct and indirect owners of the sponsor of black creek industrial reit iv inc bci iv by investing in bci iv investors will not have an interest in ipt or in this property although bci iv intends to focus its investment activities primarily on distribution warehouses and other industrial properties bci iv’s charter and bylaws do not preclude it from investing in other types of commercial property or real estate debt risk factors this sales and advertising literature must be read in conjunction with the bci iv prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering of securities to which it relates this document must be preceded or be accompanied by the bci iv prospectus which contains important information about bci iv this is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described in the bci iv prospectus the offering is made only by the bci iv prospectus neither the securities and exchange commission sec nor any other state securities regulator has approved or disapproved of the securities or determined if the prospectus is truthful or complete in addition the attorney general of the state of new york has not passed on or endorsed the merits of the offering any representation to the contrary is unlawful unless specifically noted none of the properties pictured are owned by bci iv industrial property trust inc ipt or any other affiliate of dividend capital past performance is not a guarantee of future results investing in shares of black creek industrial reit iv’s bci iv common stock involves a high degree of risk reits are not suitable for all investors bci iv is subject to various risks related to owning real estate including changes in economic demographic and real estate market conditions due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate and real estaterelated investments the amount of distributions bci iv may pay to stockholders in the future if any is uncertain there is no guarantee of any return on investment and stockholders may lose the amount they invest bci iv anticipates that its investment in real estate assets will be primarily concentrated in the industrial real estate sector and that its investments will be concentrated in the largest distribution and logistics markets in the united states such industry concentration may expose bci iv to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if its business activities included investing a more significant portion of the net proceeds of the offering in other sectors of the real estate industry and such market concentrations may expose bci iv to the risk of economic downturns in these areas in addition if bci iv’s tenants are concentrated in any particular industry any adverse economic developments in such industry could expose bci iv to additional risks these concentration risks could negatively impact bci iv’s operating results and affect its ability to make distributions to its stockholders further investing in bci iv’s common stock involves additional and substantial risks specific to bci iv including among others that bci iv has no prior operating history and there is no assurance that it will be able to achieve its investment objectives bci iv is subject to various risks related to owning real estate including changes in economic demographic and real estate market conditions due to the risks involved in the ownership of real estate and realestate related investments the amount of distributions it may pay to stockholders in the future if any is uncertain there is no guarantee of any return on stockholders’ investment in bci iv and stockholders may lose the amount they invest because there is no public trading market for shares of bci iv’s common stock and there are limits on the ownership transferability and redemption of shares of bci iv’s common stock which will significantly limit the liquidity of stockholders’ investment stockholders must be prepared to hold their shares for an indefinite length of time there is no public trading market for shares of bci iv’s common stock and it does not anticipate that there will be a public trading market for its shares so redemption of shares by bci iv will likely be the only way to dispose of stockholders’ shares bci iv’s share redemption programs will provide stockholders with the opportunity to request that bci iv redeems stockholders’ shares on a monthly basis but bci iv is not obligated to redeem any shares and may choose to redeem only some or even none of the shares that have been requested to be redeemed in any particular month in its discretion in addition redemptions will be subject to available liquidity and other significant restrictions further bci iv’s board of directors may modify suspend or terminate bci iv’s share redemption programs if it deems such action to be in bci iv’s best interest and the best interest of its stockholders as a result bci iv’s shares should be considered as having only limited liquidity and at times may be illiquid a portion of the proceeds received in this offering is expected to be used to satisfy redemption requests using the proceeds from this offering for redemptions will reduce the net proceeds available to retire debt or acquire additional properties which may result in reduced liquidity and profitability or restrict bci iv’s ability to grow its nav in connection with this offering bci iv incurs fees and expenses which will decrease the amount of cash it has available for operations and new investments in the future bci iv may conduct other offerings of common stock whether existing or new classes preferred stock debt securities or of interests in its operating partnership bci iv may also amend the terms of this offering bci iv may structure or amend such offerings to attract institutional investors or other sources of capital the costs of this offering and future offerings may negatively impact bci iv’s ability to pay distributions and stockholders’ overall return the transaction price will not accurately represent the value of bci iv’s assets at any given time and the actual value of stockholders’ investment may be substantially less bci iv’s board of directors arbitrarily determined the initial transaction price in its sole discretion and it is not based on the value of any assets bci iv may own when a stockholder purchases shares in this offering until bci iv commences monthly valuations the transaction price will be fixed and will not be adjusted based on the underlying value of any assets it may own once bci iv commences monthly valuations the transaction price generally will be based on its most recently disclosed monthly nav of each class of common stock subject to material changes as described above and will not be based on any public trading market further bci iv’s board of directors may amend its nav procedures from time to time for example if stockholders wish to subscribe for shares of bci iv’s common stock in october a stockholder’s subscription request must be received in good order at least five business days before november  generally the offering price per share would equal the transaction price of the applicable class as of the last calendar day of september plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees if accepted the stockholder’s subscription would be effective on the first calendar day of november conversely if the stockholder wishes to submit their shares for redemption in october their redemption request and required documentation must be received in good order by  pm eastern time on the second to last business day of october if accepted the stockholder’s shares would be redeemed as of the last calendar day of october and generally the redemption price would equal the transaction price of the applicable class as of the last calendar day of september subject to reduction with respect to the class w and class i redemption program for early redemption in each of these cases the nav that is ultimately determined as of the last day of october may be higher or lower than the nav as of the last day of september used for determining the transaction price therefore the price at which stockholders purchase shares may be higher than the current nav per share at the time of sale and the price at which stockholders redeem shares may be lower than the current nav per share at the time of redemption the transaction price will not represent bci iv’s enterprise value and may not accurately reflect the actual prices at which its assets could be liquidated on any given day the value a third party would pay for all or substantially all of bci iv’s shares or the price that bci iv’s shares would trade at on a national stock exchange once bci iv commences monthly valuations our management’s assessment of the market values of our properties may also differ from the appraised values of its properties further it is possible that the annual appraisals of bci iv’s properties may not be spread evenly throughout the year and rapidly changing market conditions or material events may not be fully reflected in its monthly nav the resulting potential disparity in bci iv’s nav may inure to the benefit of redeeming stockholders or nonredeeming stockholders and new purchasers of its common stock depending on whether its published nav per share for such class is overstated or understated bci iv’s nav per share may suddenly change if the valuations of its properties materially change from prior valuations or the actual operating results materially differ from what we originally budgeted for example bci iv expects to face lease expirations across its portfolio regularly and as it moves further away from lease commencement toward the end of a lease term the valuation of the underlying property generally will be expected to drop depending on the likelihood of a renewal or a new lease on similar terms some of bci iv’s executive officers directors and other key personnel are also officers directors managers key personnel andor holders of an ownership interest in the advisor the dealer manager andor other entities related to the sponsor as a result they face conflicts of interest including but not limited to conflicts arising from time constraints allocation of investment and leasing opportunities and the fact that certain of the compensation the advisor will receive for services rendered to bci iv is based on bci iv’s nav the procedures for which the advisor assists bci iv’s board of directors in developing overseeing implementing and coordinating bci iv expects to compete with certain affiliates of direct and indirect owners of the sponsor for investments and certain of those entities may be given priority with respect to certain investment opportunities this is a “blind pool” offering bci iv has not identified specific assets to acquire or investments to make with all of the proceeds of this offering stockholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate all of the investments bci iv will make with the proceeds of this offering prior to purchasing shares of its common stock this is a “best efforts” offering and if bci iv is unable to raise substantial funds then it will be more limited in its investments bci iv may change its investment policies without stockholder notice or consent which could result in investments that are different from those described in this prospectus distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operating activities such as cash flows from financing activities which may include net proceeds of this offering and borrowings including borrowings secured by bci iv’s assets bci iv’s distributions may exceed our taxable income which would represent a return of capital for tax purposes a return of capital is a return of a stockholder’s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains and will be made after deductions of fees and expenses payable in connection with bci iv’s offering some or all of bci iv’s future distributions may be paid from these sources as well as from the sales of assets cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees and from bci iv’s cash balances there is no limit on distributions that may be made from these sources however bci iv’s advisor and its affiliates are under no obligation to defer or waive fees in order to support our distributions to the extent bci iv pays distributions from sources other than its cash flows from operating activities it may have less funds available for the acquisition of properties and stockholders’ overall return may be reduced if bci iv fails to qualify as a reit it would adversely affect its operations and its ability to make distributions to its stockholders bci iv’s use of leverage such as mortgage indebtedness and other borrowings increases the risk of loss on its investments prolonged disruptions in the us and global credit markets could adversely affect bci iv’s ability to finance or refinance investments and the ability of its customers to meet their obligations which could affect its ability to meet its financial objectives and make distributions bci iv is not required by its charter or otherwise to provide liquidity to its stockholders if bci iv does not effect a liquidity event it will be very difficult for stockholders to have liquidity with respect to their investment in shares of its common stock bci iv will not be registered as an investment company and it will not be subject to the provisions of the investment company act of  or the “investment company act” applicable to registered investment companies if bci iv becomes subject to such provisions of the investment company act it could significantly impair the operation of its business this material contains forwardlooking statements including statements concerning investment objectives strategies other plans and objectives for future operations or economic performance that are based on bci iv’s current expectations plans estimates assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties as described in more detail in the “risk factors” section of the prospectus and in this sales material any of these statements could prove to be inaccurate and actual events or investments and results of operations could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statement investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements dpf is also sponsored by affiliates of black creek group dpf sold its common stock at a price of  per share in two fixedpriced primary public offerings through september  and announced a
