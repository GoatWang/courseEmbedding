expect mesabi to yield between  and  per annum with the former representing a worstcase scenario of gradual decline of us blast furnace steel productioncompany mesabi trust nysemsb mesabi or the trust is a trust which holds interests in  acres of iron ore bearing land located in the st louis county minnesota trusts revenues derive from royalty payments by northshore mining company northshore a fully owned subsidiary of cliffs natural resources inc nyseclf cliffs which is the current operator of the open pit peter mitchell mine located on trust land near babbitt minnesota the iron ore bearing taconite is crushed on site for reduction into inch size coarse ore and transported by rail to northshores pelletizing facility in silver bay minnesota at the banks of lake superior after the ore is reduced in size again by fine crushers and grinders it is separated magnetically from the nonore bearing material put in the floatation cells for concentration filtered and pelletized into green balls of  to  inch in diameter finally the green balls are heated in furnaces to over °f and hardened into the final pellet product ready for shipment by lakegoing vessels from the silver bay harbor the pellets are then sold predominantly to north american steel producers as inputs for their blast furnaces figure  location of the trust estate source mesabi mesabi itself is not involved in mining operations its activities are limited to conserving the trust estate collecting royalty income and distributing it to unitholders mesabi operates on a very limited base of largely fixed costs eg  net income margin in fy and needs no capex which is all covered by northshore the trust itself is not taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes instead trusts income is taxable directly to the unitholders who need to report their share of trust income to the irs individually regardless of whether any distributions are actually paid by the trust or not mesabi was formed in  under the laws of the state of new york its duration is limited to  years after the death of the last of  persons named in the exhibit to the trust agreement according to  investigation conducted by the trust many of those individuals are still alive and the youngest of them is  so the trust is likely to exist for another  years in  proven and probable iron ore mineral reserves were estimated by northshore at m tons of saleable product which allows for another  years of production even at maximum capacity of m tons annually these reserves were estimated by cliffs at a price of usd  per ton they would certainly be much lower under current iron ore prices but would still suffice for at least another  years average remaining life for all cliffs mines stated in its k filings with  direct cash production cost of usd ton cliffs us iron ore mining operations are at the verge of the th quartile of the lowest cost iron ore miners worldwide figure  iron ore cash cost curve source rio tinto based on woodmac this means that when iron ore prices are low northshore operation becomes unprofitable and should rationally be expected to be idled this happened most recently between november  and may  similarly before northshore became mine operator the mine was idle for  years between  and  financials in the fy ending on january   mesabi generated usd m in revenues and usd m of net income margin of  this were the weakest result of mesabi for at least  years and could largely be attributable to low volume of iron ore pellet shipments from silver bay partly due to operations idling between november and the end of the year on january   figure  mesabis long term statutory financials source own calculations based on mesabis k filings looked at from a longterm perspective financial performance of mesabi is nothing but impressive the revenue figure predominantly depends on the volume of shipments but is also impacted by selling prices of the final product realized by northshore as will further be explained below when we estimate normal cash flow for mesabi the costs are low average of  of revenue within the last  years and conversion of net income to free cash flow is truly phenomenal average of  for the last  years obviously the risk that begs to be addressed is further sustainability of the northshore business which mesabi depends on for the royalty payments particularly given the  decline in revenue in  and the recent temporary idling of northshore operations we will address this issue in the key risks section below current valuation multiples assuming the current level of earnings is here to stay the market values the trust to yield  annually figure  current pe multiples for mesabi source own calculations based on mesabis k and q filings one might argue that given the current y us government bond yields of  and the equity risk premium of  a pe multiple of x would be a better indication of where the fair value of the trust is my opinion is the higher multiple is probably well deserved since we are talking here about extremely high quality earnings almost certain to be distributed to unitholders in full in other words  is in my opinion not a bad dividend yield at all the main point of this short discussion of current valuation is to understand why the market perceives the value of the trust as it does my theory would be the following the market expects mesabi for the foreseeable future to earn what it did in fy or during the last twelve months the market fears that northshore will temporarily idle its operations again or will discontinue it permanently the market recognizes high quality of mesabi earnings and awards it a premium multiple vs what would normally be considered fair value at current valuation the market seems to completely ignore the substantial optionality embedded in mesabis revenue stream before we estimate the value resulting from optionality let us look at normal cash flow for mesabi if current market conditions continue normal cash flow level mesabis royalty revenues can be divided into nysei base overriding royalties ii bonus royalties nasdaqiii minimum advance royalties and iv fee royalties figure  mesabis royalty income structure source mesabis k filing for fy base overriding royalties are calculated as percentage of gross sales proceeds of iron ore pellets shipped from silver bay the applicable percentage is gradually increasing from  for the first one million tons to  for more than four million tons shipped mesabi reports in its k filings both volume of iron ore products shipped from silver bay and the value of base overriding royalties due assuming no differences in realized prices throughout the year this allows us to estimate to a high degree of certainty the average price of products shipped by northshore from silver bay which is reported neither by mesabi nor by cliffs and will come very useful later on when we estimate the value resulting from optionality figure  normalization of mesabis base overriding royalties and average realized prices source own calculations based on mesabis k filings average price realized by cliffs in q in its us iron ore operations including northshore was lower than the average fy price by  applying that relationship to iron ore pellets shipped from silver bay we receive an estimate of the most recent price for iron ore products attributable to mesabi of usd  per ton at average annual shipment volume of m in fyq this translates to usd m of normalized base overriding royalties under current market conditions bonus royalties arise when iron ore products shipped from silver bay are sold at prices per ton above a threshold price similarly to base overriding royalties they are calculated as percentage of gross proceeds of product shipped the applicable percentages are presented below figure  bonus royalty schedule source mesabis k filing for fy the threshold price for the  calendar year is usd  per ton and is adjusted annually for inflation since the threshold price is higher than the current price of iron ore products shipped from silver bay which we estimated at usd  no bonus payments should rationally be expected as long as current market conditions prevail minimum advance royalties are payable by northshore regardless of the amount of iron ore products shipped from silver bay they are deductible from base overriding royalties and bonus royalties which is why they are not typically recognized as sales revenue the minimum advance royalties for  are set at usd k which would cover roughly  of the maximum annual trust expenses incurred within the last  years and are subject to adjustment for inflation the minimum advance royalties are due even if operations are idled since we expect mesabi to earn base overriding royalties no minimum advance royalties should be expected under the current price environment fee royalties have historically constituted a smaller component of the trusts total royalty income they are payable by northshore to mesabi land trust another trust beneficially controlled by mesabi the royalties depend on the amount of crude ore mined ie not shipments of iron ore pellets as for other royalty income streams and the agreed price per ton subject to certain indexing for our purposes we can assume the royalties will amount to usd k per million tons of iron ore pellets shipped as was the case in fy which translates to a usd m annually under the longterm average shipment volume of m tons trust expenses have historically been growing steadily from usd m in fy to usd m in fy for an annual growth rate of  we will assume the usd m per annum to represent normal level of trust expenses now we have all we need to estimate the normal level of mesabi cash flow under current market conditions probability of operation idling is something we can try to estimate as well we know the peter mitchel mine was closed by reserve mining company the original lessee on july   it was then purchased by cyprus minerals company on august   which restarted the operations under the cyprus nmc name the operation was finally acquired by cliffs in  and the name changed to northshore another period of operations fully idling was the  months between the end of november  and may   this gives us a total of  months since august  or  of the time the operation was idle until now this does not account for the time the operation remained active immediately prior to august  under reserve mining company with that we have everything we need to calculate the normal level of mesabi cash flow figure  estimated normal cash flow under current market conditions source own calculations the resulting normal cash flow of usd m annually represents a yield of  at usd  per unit already taking into account the risk of operation idling this still takes no account of the valuable optionlike characteristics of mesabis royalty structure mesabi as real option on the price of iron ore current prices realized by northshore on iron ore products shipped from silver bay which we estimated at usd  per ton are just below this years threshold price of usd  per ton which if exceeded would trigger the payment of bonus royalties the higher the price the larger percentage of selling price achieved by northshore would be payable to mesabi obviously since the bonus royalties will not be paid in the current price environment anyway any further decrease in iron prices has no direct effect on mesabis cash flow the more variable the future iron ore prices the more valuable for mesabi this asymmetry in payoffs another source of optionality embedded in mesabi is production volume which also tends to increase with iron ore prices this is logical as the more profitable northshore operation is the stronger its drive to sell more on the other hand the lower the margins are the stronger the incentives for northshore to idle one two or even all four of its furnaces at the silver bay pelletizing plant since cash production cost does not directly depend on the iron ore price we can use the iron ore prices we estimated in figure  above as proxy for the profitability of the northshore operation and see how it relates to shipment volume figure  volume of shipments from silver bay vs estimated selling price realized by northshore source own calculations based on mesabis k filings put simply if the average net income of usd m in fyfy represents normal earning power of mesabi price of usd  per share translates into a yield of  much higher than the  we estimated above under the assumption that current market conditions are here to stay this year period covers a broad range of market environments with realized iron ore prices ranging from usd  to usd  per ton this approach to estimating yield is in my opinion by no means an oversimplification it seems to me to be a much better proxy of future yields than assuming no changes in iron ore prices whatsoever still we can do better than that and cross check this first approximation with what results from a proper real option valuation using the binomial tree approach first we need to build a binomial tree of future iron ore prices realized by northshore to do that i estimated the volatility of iron ore product prices realized by northshore at  annually and used a risk free rate of  further i assumed that northshore will idle its operations whenever the prices fall below its q production cash cost for us iron ore operations of usd  per ton meaning that only minimum advance royalty payments will be due in such a case northshore will discontinue the operation altogether if prices remain below the breakeven point for more than one year with no royalties due in such a case both base overriding royalties and bonus royalty payments will be due if the price exceeds current threshold level of usd  per ton only base overriding royalties will be due at iron ore product prices of between usd  and usd  per ton figure  binomial tree of iron ore product prices realized by northshore source own calculations now we need the volumes of iron ore products shipped by northshore from silver bay at each of the price points here i assumed the following relationship between volume of iron ore shipped from silver bay nysev and realized iron ore price nysep is v   x p   maximum of  m tons as in fy no iron ore is shipped in years when northshore operations are idled or discontinued this gives us the following binomial tree of iron ore product shipment volumes figure  binomial tree of iron ore product shipment volumes from silver bay source own calculations with realized iron ore product prices and volume of shipments we are ready to estimate cash flows for each of the nodes figure  binomial tree of mesabis cash flows source own calculations finally i assume a pe multiple of x to estimate residual value  years from now a multiple i would consider fair at current interest rate level given an equity risk premium of  we discount the resulting residual values back to present at a risk free rate of  adding back all interim cash flows with that we arrive at the valuation of mesabi of usd m or usd  per unit figure  valuation of mesabi using real options source own calculations this price represents fair value for a risk neutral investor able to hedge the underlying iron ore price changes and happy to earn the risk free rate of  annually for an investor striving to earn more than the risk free return fair value is obviously lower my estimate of the annual pretax return at usd  per trust unit is  this is not far from our first approximation using mesabis average net income in fyfy below i have presented a simple sensitivity analysis of returns at different price points and pe multiples assumed for calculation of residual value figure  sensitivity analysis of expected annual pretax returns source own calculations us steel market the key driver of demand for northshores iron ore products is us blast furnace steel production in  us production of crude steel amounted to m tons representing  of global production us steel production capacity utilization was  compared to a  range of    in  us steel producers using blast furnaces produced m tons of raw steel or  of total steel produced in the country the  integrated mills which form core group of cliffs existing or prospective clients are owned by only  groups us steel ak steel and arcelormittal the latter two are already cliffs largest customers blast furnace steel production has been decreasing at a rate of  per annum since  if this trend continues us blast furnace steel production will be half of what it is today in  years the remaining  of steel in the us in  was produced in  minimills operating electric arc furnaces and using iron and steel scrap rather than iron ore as feedstock this group constituting of a total of  steel producers is unlikely to form a potential client base for cliffs the share of steel produced in electric arc furnaces increases as recycling is becoming more profitable and convenient and environmental regulations for primary production increase behind the increased imports and reduced production of steel in blast furnaces is the global production overcapacity us steel producers have to compete with cheaper steel imports from china us net imports of steel mill products in  amounted to m tons representing  of apparent steel consumption in  cliffs expects these conditions to improve as new duties on steel should curb the steel imports entering the us but it seems that regulations are the only form of competitive moat protecting us integrated steel companies from lower cost competitors global steel and iron ore markets china with m tons of crude steel and a market share of  was worlds largest crude steel producer in  despite a  decrease in steel production from an alltime high of m tons in  the  cagr is still at over  what happens with chinese steel production determines steel and iron ore prices worldwide in turn affecting the demand for us iron ore and economics of northshores operations throughout  the iron ore price has been driven down by a combination of reduced domestic steel demand from china and higher global production of low cost iron ore which increased by m tons since  and is expected to grow by another m tons by the end of  in australia and brazil alone as a result of lower prices m tons of higher cost iron ore capacity was idled between  and  most notably in australia brazil canada china sweden the us and western africa figure  longterm inflation adjusted iron ore prices  note nominal prices for  and  and real prices for the previous years  represents a mean until june th  source vale even if we assume that current growth rates of chinese economy represent a new normal current iron ore prices of usd  per ton still look somewhat low compared to the inflation adjusted prices prevailing before  us iron ore market according to us geological survey data bn tons of iron ore were produced in the world in  us with m tons was ranked th in the world following china with bn tons australia with m tons and brazil with m tons different than for steel us is actually a net exporter of iron ore it exported m tons in  and imported m tons mainly from canada and brazil us iron ore production has been declining since  at an annual rate of  for the last  years the declines accelerated to  annually within the us  of iron ore in  was mined in michigan and minnesota  iron ore mines  open pits and  reclamation operations and  iron metallic plants including directreduced iron nysedri and iron nugget producers operated during the year given the pressure on costs resulting from low seaborne iron ore prices the industry continued efforts to reduce labour costs producers in minnesota including northshore decreased operational costs because utility companies reduced electricity rates and the state reduced royalty payments on a temporary basis a new trade agreement with countries in asia and import duties on steel products for  countries which were implemented in  is expected to alleviate the situation cliffs competitive position all us iron ore mines have a rated capacity to produce m tons of iron ore pellets cliffs is the dominant us producer with an annual rated capacity of the mines it operates at m tons northshore with m tons per annum represents  of the total us pellet production capacity cliffs directly competes with steel companies that own interests in iron ore mines in the us andor canada and with major iron ore pellet exporters from eastern canada and brazil cliffs us competitors include us steel two mines with a total capacity of m tons magnetation m tons and arcelormittal m tons arcellormittal is also cliffs largest client responsible for  of us iron ore sales revenue in  at first glance this seems risky as when demand for iron ore pellet is reduced arcelormittal should be inclined to cut supply from cliffs before it reduces its own pellet production on the other hand the competition between the us pellet producers does not seem to be fierce both arcelormittal empire and hibbing mines and us steel tilden and hibbing mines are cliffs partners in selected mining and pelletizing operations iron ore pellet production is a commodity business with many of the factors affecting its profitability beyond cliffs control cliffs might well be a low cost producer of iron ore pellets in the us market with transportation and logistics advantages to serve the us steel market but the longterm competitiveness of the us integrated steel industry is in question and forms one of the most significant longterm risks to the viability of the northshore business worst case scenario us blast furnaces close thus eliminating the demand for us mined iron ore us blast furnace steel production has been decreasing at a cagr of  between  and  the decreases accelerated to  within the last  years us iron ore mining proved a bit more resistant with annual decrease rates at  and  for the last  and for the last  years respectively china is worlds largest net exporter of steel it exports m tons of steel more than it imports creating pressure on other steel producing countries and driving their steel mills out of the business us is worlds largest net importer of steel it imports over m tons of steel more than it exports naturally oversupply of steel produced in china impacts production capacity utilization in the us chinese net exports account for  of chinese annual steel production if chinese gdp grows at  a bit below current rates and no new steel production comes online the oversupply issue should be gone in just  years there still remains a problem of unutilized production capacity in china and elsewhere globally that could flood the market with steel anytime global production capacity of steel was estimated by oecd at bn tons in  and was expected to increase to bn tons in  demand for steel stood at bn tons in  and was expected to grow at  annually if we translate that into utilization rates we get  in  actually increasing to  in  this is not far from  that would be considered very respectable and could be reached by  assuming no new capacity is added to the market it seems that the overcapacity problem is real but despite widespread concerns over its highest level ever in nominal terms it is actually not that severe and gradually decreasing even in an environment where oversupply of steel persists us steelmakers still have a chance new import duties on steel products from  countries were enacted in  the duties go as high as  according to wall street journal this already resulted in the us benchmark hotrolled coil index rising more than  in m to usd  per ton after falling  in  for illustration in europe the benchmark index was up by only  the us price is still  above the chinese price of usd  per ton the demise of us steel industry would create politically unwelcome problems no government likes to see steelworkers demonstrating on the streets and blaming it for their lost jobs so it is possible the tariffs are here to stay for as long as global oversupply continues relying on subsidies or protective tariffs is a poor business strategy that usually proves unsustainable in the longterm but it is exactly what enables us steelmakers to stay in business as things stand now even if the tariffs are not there and the oversupply continues as long as us car manufacturers and other major users of steel decide to prefer us producers us iron ore industry will be able to thrive the preference for us produced steel could be due to its marketing appeal to final customers shorter time to market or better quality control iron ore could also be used to produce pellets that in turn could serve as feedstock for producing steel in electric arc furnaces less vulnerable to foreign competition to build a worstcase scenario i have assumed northshore production attributable to mesabi lands to decrease by at  per annum this is the rate at which the us steel production in blast furnaces has been decreasing for the last  years and much faster than the  per annum the iron ore production has been falling in the same period this also impacts the multiple used for calculating residual value in  years i believe a pe multiple of x would be fair for a business declining at this pace after including these assumptions in the calculation of volume of iron ore products presented in figure  we get a new binomial tree of expected cash flows which allows us to estimate the fair value of one unit of mesabi at usd  figure  binomial tree of mesabi cash flows source own calculations again this is the value for a risk neutral investor satisfied with achieving the risk free return rate price of usd  per trust unit would represent a worstcase scenario yield of  figure  sensitivity analysis of expected annual pretax returns source own calculations risk of northshore being squeezed out of the market by increasing global supply of low cost iron ore volume of iron ore production in the us has been declining by  annually for the last  years which accelerated to  during the last  years the declines have been a bit less steep at northshore but still of similar magnitude as already explained the decreases result from reduced demand from us steelmakers employing blast furnaces due to transportation costs the same barrier that protects minnesota iron ore mining against influx of lower cost iron ore from brazil and china the ore will not be able to effectively compete beyond those territories of us and canada adjacent to the great lakes cliffs balance sheet is extremely weak its net debt stands at north of usd bn which is more than x its ebitda for the last twelve months ending on june   at this level cliffs barely affords to pay its interests on debt compare usd m of ebitda in h to usd m of net interest expense this is still before actually repaying any loans now imagine what happens if interest rates increase cliffs is currently conducting a share issue to repay part of its debt it expects to raise between usd m and usd m if successful the issue will bring cliffs net debt to x ltm ebitda which barely makes any difference obviously cliffs believes its financial results are depressed and bound to improve suffice to say its ebitda in  was more than usd bn i am not trying to argue in favor or against the chances for cliffs successfully restructuring its business here my point is simply that if cliffs is wrong and its financial performance stays close to where it is at the moment bankruptcy is a real option and a significant risk for mesabi the difference between cliffs situation and that of mesabi is that if cliffs barely stays afloat mesabi can prosper this might even be due to additional share issues further diluting current cliffs shareholders another difference is that even if cliffs goes under mesabi can still make it i can envision a situation in which northshore is acquired by arcelormittal or us steel as part of the liquidation of cliffs both of these companies already own interests in us iron ore mines some of which are operated by cliffs restructuring like this would certainly take time but it certainly puts mesabi unitholders in much better position than cliffs shareholders i believe the risk of cliffs going out of business is properly recognized in the real option valuation we used to estimate mesabis value our assumption was that at iron ore prices lower than cash mining cost mesabi earns no royalties other than minimum advance royalties and when the situation persists for more than a year no royalties whatsoever risk of current royalty fee structure renegotiation although current royalty fee structure makes great sense for mesabi it may prove unsustainable for cliffs if current iron ore prices persist therefore there is some risk of current royalty fees being modified bear in mind that two of mesabis four individual trustees are former cliffs executives likely to hold cliffs interests dearly however there are two reasons i believe such a revision is not likely firstly cliffs response to low iron ore prices was historically limiting production in its operations including northshore or idling them at low iron ore production volumes lets say m tons annually base royalties add less than  to cliffs cash costs and bonus royalties are likely to be nonexistent eliminating the royalties completely in an environment like this would save cliffs less than usd m even an extreme new deal like this would in my opinion solve none of cliffs problems secondly renegotiating the royalty structure would personally be very uncomfortable for the trustees whose sole responsibility is to preserve the trust assets approval by majority of unitholders would likely be required which in my opinion makes it unlikely for cliffs to pursue given the limited potential gains it might achieve conclusion mesabi is a very attractive business with no capex needs and the statutory mission obligation of passing all its earnings through to unitholders at a price of usd  per unit i would expect it to yield between  and  per annum with the former representing a worstcase scenario in which volume of iron ore mined declines at  per annum as us blast furnace steel production gradually dies out disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to

dated november        exhibit    mesabi trust press release   new york new york november     on october   the trustees of mesabi trust nyse msb received the quarterly royalty report for shipments of iron ore products from silver bay minnesota during the quarter ended september   from cliffs natural resources inc cliffs the parent company of northshore mining company northshore as previously reported because nyse rules require  days advance notice of a record date for declarations of distributions and mesabi trusts agreement of trust fixes a record date of october th the trustees were unable to timely consider the declaration of a distribution accordingly the trustees determined that no distribution was declared in october  and therefore no distribution will be paid in november    on october   cliffs informed the mesabi trustees that unlike historical practice the quarterly royalty report for shipments of iron ore products from silver bay minnesota during northshores quarter ended september   would not be provided to mesabi trust until the end of october  the trustees plan to hold a regular quarterly trustees meeting in january  to review the trusts reserve balances and cliffs quarterly royalty report if available for the quarter ended december   and at that time the trustees will determine the amount of any distribution if any to be made to unit holders of record as of january   as provided in the agreement of trust based upon all other information available at that time   neither cliffs nor northshore has provided mesabi trust with any projections about whether or not it will furnish future quarterly royalty reports on a timeline that will permit the trustees to consider declarations of distributions from royalty revenues anticipated to be received by the th day of the month following each calendar quarter end   as reported by cliffs based on shipments of iron ore products by northshore during the three months ended september   mesabi trust has received a base royalty of   mesabi trust also was paid a bonus royalty in the amount of  based on the average sales price per ton of iron ore pellets and the volume of shipments by northshore during the third calendar quarter of  royalties paid to mesabi trust however reflected a reduction of  as a result of negative pricing adjustments to base and bonus royalty payments for shipments and royalty payments made in the first and second calendar quarters of   accordingly the total royalty payments received in october  by mesabi trust from northshore were  which includes a royalty payment of  paid to the mesabi land trust   the royalties paid to mesabi trust are based on the volume of shipments of iron ore pellets for the quarter and the year to date the pricing of the iron ore product sales and the percentage of iron ore pellet shipments from mesabi trust lands rather than from nonmesabi trust lands  in the third calendar quarter of  northshore credited mesabi trust with  tons of iron ore as compared to  tons during the third calendar quarter of    the volume of shipments of iron ore pellets and other iron ore products by northshore varies from quarter to quarter and year to year based on a number of factors including the requested delivery schedules of customers general economic conditions in the iron ore industry and weather conditions on the great lakes further the prices under the term contracts between northshore cliffs and certain of their customers the cliffs pellet agreements to which mesabi trust is not a party are subject to interim and final pricing adjustments dependent in part on multiple price and inflation index factors that are not known until after the end of a contract year  these multiple factors can result in significant variations in royalties received by mesabi trust and in     turn the resulting funds available for distribution to unit holders by mesabi trust from quarter to quarter and from year to year these variations which can be positive or negative cannot be predicted by the trustees of mesabi trust royalty payments received in  and prior years continue to reflect pricing estimates for shipments of iron ore products that were subject to negative pricing adjustments pursuant to the cliffs pellet agreements  based on the above factors and as indicated by the trusts historical distribution payments the royalties received by the trust and the distributions paid to unit holders if any in any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of royalties that will be received or distributions that will be paid if any in any subsequent quarter or for a full year   with respect to the remainder of calendar year  northshore has not advised mesabi trust of its expected  shipments of iron ore products or what percentage of  shipments will be from mesabi trust iron ore  cliffs indicated that the royalty payments being reported today are based on estimated iron ore pellet prices under the cliffs pellet agreements which are subject to change  it is possible that future negative price adjustments could offset or even eliminate royalties or royalty income that would otherwise be payable to mesabi trust in any particular quarter or at year end thereby potentially reducing cash available for distribution to mesabi trusts unit holders in future quarters  in addition cliffs pellet agreements contain various pricing formulas and price adjustment provisions the average sales prices received by mesabi trust may not match international iron ore pellet prices   this press release contains certain forwardlooking statements with respect to iron ore pellet production iron ore pricing and adjustments to pricing shipments by northshore in  royalty including bonus royalty amounts and other matters which statements are intended to be made under the safe harbor protections of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended actual production prices price adjustments and shipments of iron ore pellets as well as actual royalty payments including bonus royalties could differ materially from current expectations due to inherent risks such as general and industry economic trends uncertainties arising from war terrorist events and other global events higher or lower customer demand for steel and iron ore decisions by mine operators regarding curtailments or idling production lines or entire plants environmental compliance uncertainties difficulties in obtaining and renewing necessary operating permits higher imports of steel and iron ore substitutes processing difficulties consolidation and restructuring in the domestic steel market indexing features in cliffs pellet agreements resulting in adjustments to royalties payable to mesabi trust and other factors further substantial portions of royalties earned by mesabi trust are based on estimated prices that are subject to interim and final adjustments which can be positive or negative and are dependent in part on multiple price and inflation index factors under agreements to which mesabi trust is not a party and that are not known until after the end of a contract year although the mesabi trustees believe that any such forwardlooking statements are based on reasonable assumptions such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially  additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in the trusts filings with the securities and exchange commission including its annual report on form k  mesabi
