and good afternoon everyone we executed the business well in the quarter delivering solid financial results strong sales performance and continued progress on our strategic growth initiatives internal revenue growth was  adjusted operating margin expanded  basis points and adjusted earnings per share grew  sales performance was strong in the quarter attaining more than  of quota and was  ahead of last years second quarter importantly that momentum carried over into july producing one of the best sales months in our history given the strength of our results to date and our expectation of revenue growth acceleration in the second half of the year we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to  to  an increase of  to  over last year now let me provide an update on our three key shareholder priorities for  which as a reminder our first continue to build highquality revenue while meeting our earnings commitments second build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and third to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients we continue to focus our efforts on increasing our level of high quality revenue growth as such our internal revenue growth of  in the quarter was highlighted by  growth in our payments segment we saw continued strength in our transactional businesses and emv card distribution overall internal revenue growth in the quarter was compressed by  basis points from a combination of lower termination fees emv deferral and negative currency impact adjusted operating margin was up  basis points in the quarter and is up  basis points through june  in line with our expectations this was led by strong performance in our payments segment which recorded increases in adjusted operating margin of  and  basis points in the quarter and first six months of the year respectively as i mentioned we raised our earnings per share guidance on the back of a  increase in adjusted eps for the first half of the year free cash flow per share to date has trailed adjusted eps a bit up  through june which we expect to normalize relative to earnings growth in the second half of the  were well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year our second priority is to build and enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions one of our flagship payment technologies is our rxp bill payment solution with over  million active users across more than  financial institutions including eight of the top  banks bill payment remains the killer digital app for banking and during the quarter we were pleased to renew our longstanding client relationships with pnc bank with  billion of assets and suntrust bank with  billion in assets weve spoken about the opportunity to differentiate our realtime network now through our unique biller relationships during the quarter we expanded our network by signing one of the nations largest wireless providers to process payments on our billmatrix platform in early july we also signed one of the largest blue cross blue shield insurers to a comprehensive suite of payment services to provide its members with more convenient health insurance payment options our solution will be leveraged for multichannel payments from the states public exchange insurer site ivr company agents and a good number of our more than  walkin locations across the country payment effectiveness requires scale and we are pleased to be increasing ours in a unique area of our value proposition along those lines you may have seen we inked an agreement with early warning a bankowned consortium to enable clients to participate in an emerging pp network connecting many of the leading financial institutions in the united states together this furthers our role as a key enabler and advocate for our clients to participate in the ongoing evolution of payments in the manner in which they choose demand for emv issuance has remained strong and card personalization volume is growing as personalization of cards got closer to the number of cards manufactured the amount of the incremental revenue deferral in the quarter reduced sequentially but remained at levels higher than anticipated in our internal plan that said we expect emv card demand to remain healthy for the next several years and also anticipate that to be followed by a wave of contactless card issuance mobiliti asp users grew by nearly  over the prior years quarter to  million users and grew  sequentially we also had strong growth in our mobiliti business solution with end users growing more than  quarteroverquarter were still in the very early stages of the digitization of the banks most important customers our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients during the quarter fiserv was recognized multiple times for our innovation including inclusion in the informationweek elite  a list of the most innovative users of business technology we won best use of technology at the pymntscom alexa awards by connecting our bestinmarket corillian solution to amazon echo for voicebased financial transactions and information at the speed of thought westpac bank the second largest bank in australia with assets of over a billion of westpac live was ranked number one in forresters  global mobile banking functionality benchmark report in july westpacs mobile banking offering is built on our marketleading corillian solution and is supported by fiserv to further digitize branch banking we announced verifast our stateoftheart palm authentication solution this solution which relies on sophisticated biometric technology that goes well beyond fingerprint enables authentication via palm vein patterns and blood flow in the hand this fast easy and secure experience is producing much higher customer satisfaction and improving associate productivity we see significant deployment opportunities for the back office teller line and service desks in the roughly  branches spanning our nearly  account processing clients in the us lastly eight new dna clients went live in the quarter including three with assets over  billion which brings us to  implementations for the year to date as compared to  in the same period last year with that let me turn the call over to bob to provide more detail on our financial results robert w hau  chief financial officer  treasurer thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone adjusted revenue for the quarter grew  to  billion and increased  to  billion in the first half of the year internal revenue growth was  in both the quarter and year to date these results included  and  basis points respectively of combined negative impact due to emv revenue deferrals reduction in termination fees and fx headwinds adjusted operating income in the quarter increased  to  million and is up a healthy  year to date to  million adjusted operating margin was  in both the quarter and year to date periods increasing  basis points and basis points respectively over the prior year periods these gains are due primarily to strong payments segment performance and progress in operational efficiency initiatives offset somewhat by expected margin pressure from acquisitions and continuing investments in new product innovation adjusted earnings per share increased  to  in the quarter and for the first half of the year adjusted earnings per share is up a robust  to  our strong first half performance has resulted in increasing our adjusted eps outlook for the year at the segment level our payments business continued to deliver strong results with internal revenue growth of  in the quarter and  year to date adjusted revenue which includes a full quarters contribution from our two recent acquisitions grew  in the quarter to  million performance was led by strong results in card services and output solutions including emv and solid growth in epayments as jeff mentioned while we experienced improved emv personalization we still lag manufacturing and as a result deferred an additional  million of revenue in the quarter payments segment adjusted revenue was up  year to date to  billion we further extended existing relationships with our market leading solutions including signing  debit clients nearly  mobile clients and more than  bill payment clients in the quarter debit transaction growth in the quarter remained in the high single digits and pp transaction growth was again more than  importantly as jeff noted we expanded our base of mobiliti asp subscribers by nearly  in the quarter to  million we continue to believe were in the early innings of the digital transformation and see significant runway into the future growth as consumers further integrate digital and specifically mobile banking into the fabric of their day to day lives payments segment adjusted operating margin was excellent increasing  in the quarter to  million and year to date was up  to  million segment adjusted operating margin crossed  for the first time expanding  basis points to  and was up  basis points to  for the first half of the year this strong performance is even better when considering the adjusted operating margin compression from the businesses we acquired early in the year our acquisition integration efforts are progressing well and we expect to begin realizing synergy benefits late this year and into  adjusted revenue in the financial segment was  million in the quarter and  million sic  billion in the first half of the year internal revenue growth in the financial segment was  in both the quarter and year to date segment growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by a combination of currency implementation timing and a reduction of specialized regulatorybased services and lower termination fees for the full year we now expect lower termination fees compared to last year this is due primarily to an estimated reduction of termination fee revenue in q of  million to  million compared to the higher than typical level in the third quarter of last year most of which did not originate in the account processing businesses and while a reduction in termination fee revenue is generally good for the longterm health of the business it can create comparability issues as were seeing this year that said we expect to return to more normal termination fee revenue in the fourth quarter we continue to expect stronger financial segment growth in the second half of the year as we see higher licenserelated revenue new client implementations revenue from the rollout of new innovative technology solutions such as notifi and palm authentication and improved termination fee comparison in q adjusted operating income in the financial segment was  million in the quarter and  million year to date adjusted operating margin was down  basis points in the quarter to  but was up  basis points sequentially adjusted margin in the quarter was impacted by several factors including lower termination fees and incremental investments in innovationbased solutions such as agiliti and notifi corporate adjusted net operating loss for the quarter was in line with expectations and generally consistent with the comparable prioryear results our adjusted effective tax rate was  in the quarter slightly lower than the prior years comparable rate of  and while we continue to anticipate an adjusted effective tax rate of about  for the full year our comparable tax rate for the second half of the year at about  is significantly higher than last years adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of  which was just over  free cash flow was  million during the first half of the year with the timing of working capital including receivables and tax payments impacting the first half of the year results which we expect to improve by the end of the year free cash flow per share is up  to  for the first six months of the year total debt outstanding was  billion as of june  or  times trailing  month adjusted ebitda we continue to utilize share repurchase as our capital allocation benchmark repurchasing  million shares of stock in the quarter for  million through june  we have repurchased  million shares at an average cost of  per share and at quarters end there were  million shares outstanding and  million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization with that let me turn the call back to jeff jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thanks bob as we mentioned up front sales in the second quarter were excellent coming in  higher than last years second quarter and  of quota performance was strong across the board and included only a minimal number of large transactions sales momentum continued to be very strong in july we signed several large transactions which underpinned one of our best single month sales performance in our history importantly several of these wins have shorter implementation cycles and should provide measurable impact revenue in the fourth quarter at this point we fully expect to exceed our sales goal for the year integrated sales were  million in the quarter flat to the prior year and up  sequentially driven primarily by digital and payments solutions delivering value to clients through our addon solutions continues to be a very important element of our company strategy our operational effectiveness program moved forward in the quarter including measurable progress on our data center optimization program to date weve combined seven centers and expect to complete additional locations including one of our largest in footprint later this year while were deriving some benefit from these actions currently there should be a larger aggregate benefit in future years that said we did capture  million of saves in the quarter and through june  weve achieved nearly  of our full year operational effectiveness goal of  million q had more than its fair share of events influencing the environment we saw a minicrash in alternative lending as certain high fliers experienced turbulence in their loan portfolios and while these losses may temporarily slow the proliferation of new lending technologies we continue to believe the opportunity to introduce new innovative technology is significant our offerings are wellpositioned to benefit directly and indirectly from the continuing rise of the digital financial consumer which remains a top priority for technology spend across the banking landscape we also witnessed the volatility of brexit during the quarter and the related strengthening of the dollar around the world although early we do not anticipate measurable brexit impact on our nonus business other than increased currency translation pressure on revenue which is incorporated in our full year outlook we remain on track to achieve our full year financial objectives we continue to expect  internal revenue growth of  to  driven by stronger performance in the second half of the year given the lower than anticipated termination fees which as bob mentioned is exacerbated in the third quarter the increased pressure of fx and the effect of a larger emv revenue deferral we now expect internal revenue growth to bias towards  for the full year we expect a much higher internal revenue growth rate in q compared to q given termination fee comparisons sales and implementation revenue and additional contributions from our strategic growth initiatives as a result of our strong first half performance along with the anticipated growth acceleration in the second half of the year weve increased our adjusted earnings per share guidance range to  to  which is growth of  to  over the  in  we continue to expect adjusted operating margin to increase at least  basis points for the year which includes more than  basis points of negative impact from acquisitions and the impact of reduced termination fee revenue and last we continue to expect free cash flow per share to be at least  for the full year we exit the first half of the year well positioned to meet our current financially goals and have sales momentum to continue moving us forward as important we continue to make progress on our journey to sustainably increase our level of high quality internal revenue growth before we go to qa allow me to recognize the more than  associates who make a difference for our clients through innovation and excellence each and every day with that kerry lets open the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session our first question is from david togut of evercore isi your line is now open david mark togut  evercore isi thank you good afternoon based on some of your comments about organic growth biasing toward  for  as a whole how should we start to think about next year in a particular – im thinking back to your analyst day from last year where you mapped out a  to  basis point target increase in organic growth over the long term jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah thanks david so first of all we feel actually quite good about the trajectory of our growth rate we believe that we will grow or expand our internal revenue growth rate in  over  within the  to  basis point range but the encouraging news for us is that we do expect to have a much higher growth in the second half of the year and we expect that to be the jumping off point going into  so we feel like were on track our strategic initiatives are coming online we had a little bit more lumpiness in our revenue this year than were used to but again that doesnt affect our longer term view and we would expect to see our internal revenue growth rate continue to increase  to  basis points a year into the foreseeable future david mark togut  evercore isi do you have a pretty good line of sight as to how the emv card personalization revenue deferral is going to roll into q and q jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yes david mark togut  evercore isi got it and then you called out some nice growth in dna implementations year to date can you talk about the general competitive environment in the large credit union space you called out in the first quarter call a go live on the vibrant credit union i mean how do you see share trends going forward jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director so we continue to have a very very strong success with dna on the larger end of the credit union space as well as on the larger end of the bank space on the credit union side we have continued to win substantially more than our fair share of competitive takeaways when we go up against anyone in the market so our winloss record is quite high going up against a prospect so we do very well in that environment and frankly the vibrant go live is was very important to us as you know well david because youve known us for a long time these tend to be longer tail sales processes and then longer tail implementations with vibrant going live just in q that created a level of energy in the market and we have confidence that that will turn into additional conversations and frankly we would have an expectation that would turn into additional wins on the larger credit union end of the market david mark togut  evercore isi understood and then jeff your comments regarding the emv growth runway i think youre probably the most bullish in terms of the length of the runway in which you can grow emv related revenue is there anything specific about your customer base on the card issuer side that lets say would give you a longerterm runway for growth were starting to see some managements caution that emv benefit may be near an end particularly vantiv on their fi business mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah hey togut this is mark or david this is mark the key thing that id say thats different is because we are so much focused on debit and debit has been later than a lot of the credit processors we think that theres more runway left for us because of that bias id say thats the biggest thing jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah and i would also add to that david that we remember that we produce cards for a much larger group than just our issuer kind of our debit issuer banks and so and much of that business to marks point is on the debit side so not only do we have a fair runway in our own base but as well as all the other issuers that dont yet use our debit processing services david mark togut  evercore isi understood thank you very much jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you our next question is from ramsey elassal of jefferies your line is now open ramsey elassal  jefferies llc hi guys jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director hi ramsey ramsey elassal  jefferies llc given the fairly steep back half acceleration can you help us think through kind of risk factors that might cause you to come in lower than where you think youre going to come in are you depending on implementations that cant get pushed back or how should we sort of assess the risk of whats to come here jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah so a great question ramsey so we obviously are committed to producing internal revenue growth within our outlook right we said biasing to  for the year and the payments segment has performed quite well all year long and we do expect a bit of continuing compound growth coming there as well as new live clients as weve been talking about for the last several years so that points the majority of the focus on the financial segment and our calculus and weve looked at this sort of a variety of different ways primarily because we are expecting more growth later in the year that we have historically seen and it really comes down to a couple of factors and let me lay them out the first one is weve had some kind of lumpiness in the prior year on our compares so we had some regulatory and we talked about in the first quarter some license related revenue that was lumpy in our  numbers and weve had to overcome the substantial majority of that in the first half of the year and so we see that easing on both fronts and therefore were already covering that in terms of our recurring revenue and we would expect is that lumpiness in the prior year went away that well get some comparable benefit the second item and this is one of the larger ones is just this the continuing growth in our transactional services now some of these are certainly on the payments side lending im sorry mobiliti emv as we were talking about the reduction of the deferral but weve also seen some very good growth in our lending businesses our largest account processing client went live late in q so all of those we believe will provide benefit the next item is youll remember back to last year we had a pretty slow sales year really until q and it was actually primarily in december actually december of  was by far our largest sales month in history and as you know most of our implementations run six nine  months or more so the revenue that we signed last december its starting to come live in this second half of the year and a lot of that was in the financial segment so were excited about that and then lastly on the sales front we mentioned on our prepared remarks a couple of the large wins that we had this year have either unusually short implementation cycles or they are made to be unusually short because we were working them well before we signed them so in fact we would expect a number of those larger deals to contribute revenue in q all of those items we have pretty darn good visibility to and then lastly just the compound effect again of some of our innovationbased initiatives programs like our integrated payment strategy notifi agiliti and the like so weve got a long laundry list knowing that this would be an important point weve got it weve got them recorded and weve got our management and our teams focused to make sure that we achieve the numbers in the second half of the year but again i think very importantly is these growth engines are not one and done engines these are engines that will sustain it will give us we think very good a very good tailwind entering into  and then when you combine that with the very good sale – into  im sorry – when you combine that with the very good sales performance that were seeing this year and we expect to see this year were pretty bullish on how  is starting to stack up ramsey elassal  jefferies llc great thats super helpful another question i wanted to ask was about free cash flow youd mentioned there were a couple of puts and takes in terms of why it is on absolute basis i think relatively flat versus last year and not growing too fast on a per share basis can you revisit that for some reason i was expecting the emv revenue deferral to have a similar positive impact on cash flow but i might not be getting that correct could you go through again just sort of the cash flow dynamics and why you expect them whats been weighing on them and why theyre going to pick up a little later in the year robert w hau  chief financial officer  treasurer yeah ramsey its bob there were the two key drivers that i talked about from a working capital standpoint in terms of accounts receivable as well as the timing of our tax payments with actually the bigger weighting on accounts receivable and yes youre right the way to think about emv some of that deferral is cash positive because we see the cash in advance of booking the revenue but that has declined pretty precipitously over last four quarters down to only about  million this quarter so not a big driver from a cash flow standpoint and that receivables collection is really a timing and in fact we started to see that collection turn already in july so those receivables have started to turn into cash already for third quarter ramsey elassal  jefferies llc got it thanks a lot guys thats all for me jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thanks ramsey operator thank you our next question is from tientsin huang of jpmorgan your line is now open tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc hey good afternoon just wanted to i guess clarify just i guess the bias to the  it sounds like term fees is the biggest contributor to that and then i may have missed it if thats the case then how are you able to i guess upgrade your eps target given thats a higher margin component is it just mix or you are pulling some levers to get there jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah tientsin you did hear that on the termination fees and it is by far the largest single impacting item i would say are the unplanned item in our results or our estimated results for  obviously its kind of a mixed bag right on one hand its always better to not have termination fee revenue on the other hand termination fee revenue tends to have fairly high margins as you note you probably heard in our prepared remarks that were doing quite a nice job on our operational effectiveness program were already at about  of our earlier target and the beauty of that is thats real economic benefit that the margins on that are comparable to margins on term fees so there is some benefit there and frankly as you know well if you look at the sources of our growth being in the payments segment the payments segment i think we mentioned in our remarks crossed over  for the first time ever i mean the mix of the revenue is actually working quite favorably for us this year and were not pulling any levers beyond the normal levers that we always pull it just so happens that in some of the products take mobiliti that we invested in several years ago once you cross the line on that the contributions are pretty attractive tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc got it okay so high incremental margins there makes sense and just as a follow up just jeff you commented it sounds like june july are pretty strong from a sales perspective despite what you called out  right brexit and the alt lending so why do you think thats the case what pulled through some of this strong selling because weve heard sort of mixed things around discretionary spend it sounds like youre seeing good sales execution why is there a delta in your mind jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director its really across two planes as best i can see one is a majority of our larger sales are tending to be nondiscretionary so its using our billmatrix platform to process payments for one of the very large blues where there is very interesting dynamics going on in the health insurance and therefore the health payments industry that were just starting to play in weve been farming that space for a couple of years we mentioned we signed one of the largest wireless companies in the us again to use one of our payment acceptance platforms and that weve talked about a lot is an important differentiator in our now strategy so the ability to route payments not just through issuers but being able to have issuers consumers and billers using the same realtime ecosystem you may have seen that we signed an arrangement with ews so again building out that payment movement or the movement of money capability so on the nonissuer side thats working out quite well on the issuer side were continuing to see lots and lots of energy around capabilities that are improving the digital experience so mobile online online is getting an interesting wave of at least refresh lookieloos saying hey ive got this really great mobile experience what do i do with online and then some of our payments capabilities that are whether its our ips set of capabilities account transfer bill payment which is still kind of as i mentioned the killer app of non pointofsale payments those are all the areas which were getting focus and having good interest and frankly thats why our sales are good but importantly our pipeline continues to grow pretty precipitously tientsin huang  jpmorgan securities llc all right good thanks for the insight jeff jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you our next question is from dave koning of baird your line is now open david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah hey guys jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director hey dave david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah and i guess first of all you mentioned about  basis point headwind from some of the oneoffs this quarter lower term fees fx emv the deferral there can you give us what that impact is on each of the segments jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director we typically wouldnt do that but emv sits in payments and the others are generally i think in financial so im not exactly giving it to you dave but thats the roundabout david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah okay okay and then i guess secondly for q you mentioned the  million to  million term fee headwind does that mean that q the core – it sounds like the core the full half – the second of the year is going to accelerate but does q get kind of pushed back down towards kind of the same growth as q and q given that roughly a little over  headwind to the business and then q is where the real acceleration happens right jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think thats a good way to think about it because of obviously the termination fees those termination fees while theyre not from the account processing businesses they are sitting in that segment so i think thats a reasonable way to think about it david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker okay and then i guess just the last thing the  million of acquisition benefit this quarter is there any real seasonality there or is that a pretty good number kind of the rest of the year to think about that  million per quarter robert w hau  chief financial officer  treasurer yeah we think that overall the acquisition benefit for the year is about  to  so about  a quarter of course we acquired both those businesses kind of mid to latter part of first quarter so minimal impact q full benefit in q david j koning  robert w baird  co inc broker yeah okay great thank you jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thanks dave operator thank you our next question is from jim schneider of goldman sachs your line is now open james schneider  goldman sachs  co good afternoon thanks for taking my question i was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on where the pipeline of dna wins stands today you talked about eight new conversions coming on with three over  billion can we maybe talk a little bit about – and i think that the total pipeline stands at a little over  as of last quarter so have you refilled that pipeline and do you expect the remaining ones over  billion to come on before the year end jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director well were optimistic jim that were always going to have a nice backlog of dna wins but we dont have any reason to believe that our expectation for golives in the year has changed i mean were moving that along and again as i mentioned to daves question earlier interest in dna continues to be very strong across all charter types so from a pipeline perspective we would expect that to continue to be additive james schneider  goldman sachs  co thats helpful and then with respect to the operational effectiveness program you talked about the  attainment toward the  million target for the year is that something you would expect that you would kind of potentially pull future program savings into this year or would you plan to kind of get to that  million attainment and then just kind of stop and reset for  and can you maybe talk about how much more there is to go on the data center side specifically mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president we dont really manage it around the financials we manage it to drive as much operational effectiveness as we can the target that we have has specific programs attached to it and those are all tracking well or better than we might have expected going into the year but we dont moderate the pace of those around kind of how much is realized in any one given year so no we wouldnt slow that down jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah i would say jim i mean to marks point in most years we exceed our target by a bit and that i would obviously given where we are this year we would expect that on the data center piece itself there is a lot of runway right as we talked about at our investor day last year its taken us awhile to get some muscle and a cadence around it weve gotten seven so far completed year to date and we would expect that to continued grow for the next several years ultimately were going to go down to a handful of larger data centers that we think will help deliver a better service to our clients and frankly reduce our costs so thats a meaningful opportunity moving forward mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president and jim id just remind you were in year one of a five year program thats got a  million five year objective for saving so were in the very early stages of five years of cost improvement james schneider  goldman sachs  co thats very helpful thank you mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president thanks jim operator thank you our next question is from paul condra of credit suisse your line is now open paul condra  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you afternoon all jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director hey paul paul condra  credit suisse securities usa llc broker just a couple first on the early warning can you just talk a little more about what i guess what fiserv gets out of that arrangement and anything about economics that work for you mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president yeah so this is mark i mean the arrangement were pretty excited about it the early warning as you probably know is kind of really has picked up the clearxchange business and they have been working on this development of kind of a large bank pp network that their owners can all sign on to what we announced today is that we will be a technology provider to offer our technology our pp technology which includes lots of different kind of backend services that would enable any financial institution in the country to participate in that network that ews is going to be introducing so in many ways i think were really in the leading position to provide this turnkey technology that financial institutions in general will need now some of the larger banks that are remember that are ownermembers of the ews have built their own technology but an awful lot of other financial institutions and certainly as you go into the larger number of community institutions still rely on a technology provider like us to give them the backend systems they need to participate in that kind of a network jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah i would also say paul i mean part of this is were in the early stages of understanding what its all going to mean like many other service offerings some banks will create some institutions will create their own pp offering and some will use parts of ours or parts of someone elses but many of them we believe will use all of ours weve got roughly  institutions today in the us that are using our popmoney technology and as bob mentioned in his prepared remarks were up to a pretty solid cadence of a  transactional growth every quarter were announcing year over year growth kind of in that range it is our belief that there are roughly  persontoperson payments per household per year so  times  million households roughly in the us that have an opportunity to be digitized electronified and moved in a different way and whether that ends up being  or  or  none of us really know but we believe that our technology is central to having that happen so ultimately we think well drive transaction volume well think there will be network gateways therell be risk products there will be all kinds of different pieces of that value chain and weve been in this for a while weve got a nice footprint some clients will probably link to early warning but what we do know is with the  institutions that we provide core account processing for today we think well play an important role in serving them and the  institutions that use our bill payment solution including eight of the top  banks in the us will continue to operate with us we think there is ultimately going to be quite an exciting and interesting payment ecosystem beyond pointofsale thats created paul condra  credit suisse securities usa llc broker yeah i mean it sounds like there is a lot going on kind of leads into my next question which is as youre getting into these emerging areas lending mobile i think you talked about biometrics and pp and how does that feed into the way you think about ma do you have all the capabilities you need or are there some assets out there that might make sense jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director i think any of us would be foolish to say we have all of the assets that we need we feel quite good that weve got the lions share of whats necessary today but we will continue to be active reviewers of whats going on in the market and look for opportunities to improve our product set or our solution set to help drive value for our financial institution and nonfinancial institution clients so were active out there but well continue to be pragmatic and compare every allocation of capital to share repurchase as we always do and again look for opportunities to get the tailwinds of the macros whenever we can paul condra  credit suisse securities usa llc broker okay great thank you jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you our next question is from darrin peller of barclays your line is now open darrin peller  barclays capital inc thanks guys jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director hi darrin peller  barclays capital inc just starting off quickly just if you help us understand what the normalized growth rate do you think would have been in the financial segment if you can sort of address or adjust for all those items that affected this quarter just so we can help understand the normalized growth going forward jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director im only pausing darrin because im trying to think about we typically dont give much segmentbysegment guidance but i would say that it would be measurable and probably well leave it at that darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay all right thanks let me just follow then on a question that was asked before with your thoughts on what you have in terms of assets im really just trying to understand a the competitive environment now i mean obviously one of your biggest competitors has made a very large acquisition focusing on larger financial institutions has that led to a change at all in your area of focus around the core or area of focus around some of the larger banks on some of the ancillary services you may provide some of the larger financials and then maybe a followon would be just on the ma side again i mean youve talked a lot about international over the years being an opportunity and yet i think were still waiting to see if something actually happens on the ma front there so can you just update us on your thoughts around anything outside of the domestic market thanks jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director sure darrin so i assume that on the competitive question you were talking about the guys who bought sungard we dont really compete very much against the sungard assets and that is not strategically aligned with where were focused in the market so frankly we have not seen very much change in the competitive market because of that and i dont see a lot of parallel between for example whats going on in the pp space with the early warning announcement and our over  institutions using popmoney and what is being done in that larger end and so strategically thats not where weve elected or opted to focus so well continue to look for ways to increase the robustness and the relevance of our model but i dont think youll see us to do something like that as it relates to the nonus side of the market the beauty of the us market is its a relatively singular large market and there are not any other large singularly focused markets in the world with the exception of probably china and perhaps india and those markets have nuances of their own that we wont talk about at this point so the challenge for us is being wed like in some ways have a larger nonus footprint but we want that nonus footprint to have the high quality revenue characteristics that we look for and those would be sustainable recurring streams of revenue that have attractive levels of free cash so we continue to use those screens and thats always going to be the constraints to how we think about deploying capital both in and out of the us darrin peller  barclays capital inc okay that makes sense guys thanks very much for the help jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thanks darrin operator thank you our next question is from andrew jeffrey of suntrust your line is now open andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking the call nice win with early warning jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thank you andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc and jeff it sort of i guess dovetails into my bigger picture with regard to mobiliti and the payments segments obviously performed very nicely can you quantify perhaps in your segment organic revenue growth the contribution from mobiliti solutions in aggregate and then maybe i know its hard to quantify but maybe and its early perhaps frame up timing for contribution from the clearxchange solution i mean is that a function of banks throwing it out is it a function of transaction volume on the platform how should we think about that jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director so let me ill give it a shot and mark will fill in where i have missed so im going to take the second one first so we have ideas on how the rollout will go i think there has been some discussion publicly about advertising and some marketing around the pp services for some of the larger institutions weve seen that going on intermittently but there seems to be a lot of energy around that and our experience at least with services such as bill pay is when you talk about them to consumers they tend to want to start using them so we would expect to see transactions start to grow as where awareness is raised and perhaps it wont be as – the velocity wont be the same as venmo but frankly we believe that most consumers would prefer to transact in an area that is safe and secure and through their trusted financial institution and so were optimistic about how that will turn into growth in the future we would expect that growth to primarily be to come through as payment transaction volume some services helping institutions think about how theyre going to best position their offerings or embed some of our technologies in their own unique offerings if they would like to do there are many andrew institutions who use our bill pay technology but they embed into an experience thats unique to them and i think well see some of that as we move through pp so i think it will come through in a lot of different ways ultimately be through transactions and either transactions that we initiate or transactions that we accept on behalf of our clients so a little bit more of a gateway nuance on top of the normal end to end processing that we do overall mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president the only thing id add as jeff said the volume of transactions is where we think this is ultimately going to why this might be different this time and fundamentally weve known for some time that in order to get sort of a ubiquitous pp offering really to take off in the united states you needed a couple things that most of these networks were not able to fully deliver you needed it coming from a trusted financial institution thats why we have been around this business and kind of pushing this business so hard we think thats a big opportunity it needs to be a branded solution that people will recognize and thats been a challenge to break through with a brand in the market but very importantly there is two other factors that i think is going to come through with this one is the ubiquity of it being available through the largest financial institutions and being able to find end points through much of the banking system is really where the promise of what we think the ews offering plays the other aspect of this is that network will be at its inception a realtime network and we think that the consumer value proposition that comes along with a realtime network and a realtime transaction is the kind of thing that will generate more enthusiasm for use over some of the other competitive alternatives so for all those reasons were again optimistic weve been optimistic about pp as a potential game changer for some time and we think this continues to be a nicely evolving line of business robert w hau  chief financial officer  treasurer and andrew let me just move on to the other half of your question we dont disclose what the size of the mobile or digital business is on a standalone basis we have at our investor days we have kind of put wheels out there that give the general sizing as typically part of our i think its part of our epayments business but its out there its a rapidly growing piece of the business the growth contributions are important and i would actually venture to say we are even earlier in our mobile journey and our online transformation journey than we are in our emv journey and that is i mean we have significant growth runway to go most of the pundits believe that well see over the next three to five years  to  of banking users be mobile and that number for us is well well well well south of that so we feel quite good about that and again i would not underestimate the importance of remodeling the digital experience for online as well so both of those we think are important and then we did do the little – the aci the community financial services acquisition early on were just starting to move those client institutions and ultimately their customers into the mix and we think there is a lot of value to be created there as well andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thats great perspective thank you jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thank you operator thank you our next question is from ashwin shirvaikar of citigroup your line is now open ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker hey guys jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director hey ashwin mark a ernst  chief operating officer  executive vice president hey ashwin ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker jeff actually your last question is a good segue into what i wanted to ask or clarify as mobiliti becomes more or less mainstream and clearly you have many relevant front end products for that should that not lower your cost structure over time because these channels are also inherently more self service more cloud based is that already part of your operational effect and your thought process how should we think about the cost side implications of it jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah the answer is for the client institutions over time when digital is scale self service is a much more important piece of the equation and so i do believe that for the financial institutions theyll see cost benefits for us the most important part of us getting cost benefits is scaling the platform so the more scale we get in the platform the lower our costs kind of a unit cost will get over time ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker so you wont see lower support costs or anything like that you are primarily benefiting from growth jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah i mean again if you think about we supply these technologies to the financial institution theyre supplying them to their end customers we take in if we have a core account processing client were providing them with support for any one of the  different applications that they have i think as humans get more dependent on self service it could have a derivative impact on us but we havent thought about that as a way of reducing our costs but ill certainly have bob take a look at that ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker okay and bob sorry to create work for you there the other question i had was on pipeline and i think you may have answered part of it but just want to revisit it seems like it took maybe six or seven months to go from one sales peak last december to this july if i can call this july sort of a sales peak does that mean that you now have to again replenish for the next one two quarters in terms of what your sales is going to look like in the second half of the year jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah i think that at least from our standpoint one of the reasons why were so bullish both for our results this year but also moving into  is our pipeline even with the very strong performance the pipeline is quite robust right now and its not as geometric as we had a peak in december and a peak in july because frankly we did have a slower year last year we had a very very strong year in  we spent a good part of  replenishing the pipeline but not just replenishing it by adding in clients but really looking at our processes and building what we believe is a more sustainable engine for the future in ensuring that that pipeline maintains at a higher level i would actually say that we have more large transactions in our pipeline right now than – even with our closes in july than we had at the same juncture last year so the values the values and especially the kind of probability weighted values are substantially better now than they were a year ago and given some of the momentum that were seeing we would at least be optimistic that we would be in even better shape a year from now ashwin shirvaikar  citigroup global markets inc broker got it thank you appreciate the color jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah thank you operator thank you our last question is from bryan keane of deutsche bank your line is now open bryan c keane  deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi guys jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director hey bryan bryan c keane  deutsche bank securities inc just most of my questions have been asked and answered just a couple clarifications in q  if theres not going to really be an acceleration internal revenue growth i think that would suggest a bigger number in fourth quarter maybe an  internal revenue growth in fourth quarter to make it average out  for the year just want to make sure thats true because youre also talking about that being the jumping off point for  so  would be a quite higher growth rate than what weve seen in the past when we think about  so jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah no thats right i mean i cant speak to the exactness of the numbers but i would say that theyre directionally correct and one of the biggest swing factors tough is the termination swing so were getting bob we mentioned in our remarks that we expected termination fee revenue to be down call it  million  million in q but we expect to return to normal termination fee levels in q so you have that kind of oddity that you have to i think normalize but beyond that normalization we always have a little seasonality in q but i think directionally thats why we have a good amount of confidence when we start thinking about how that translates to  bryan c keane  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just on free cash flow i know it was flat kind of year to date what does that look like then for by we get to the full year will free cash flow grow with adjusted earnings per share which i think is expected to grow  to  will that catch up to grow with that kind of growth rate robert w hau  chief financial officer  treasurer thats essentially the right way to think about it bryan well see better growth in the second half of the year that will more closely approximate the growth in earnings per share and as we pointed out in the opening comments we expect to be at more than  free cash flow to shares jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director yeah bryan i think you know pretty well that typically were running a little bit better than operating earnings in our free cash flow and then we have the benefit of reduced share count and bob will probably reprimand me but basically in q we had a receivable we had a billed and receivable without any corresponding build in days and we also had a kind of an unusually large tax payment and those kinds of things we would not expect to recur for the remainder of the year so we would expect to be kind of generally back on track robert w hau  chief financial officer  treasurer correct bryan c keane  deutsche bank securities inc okay super thanks for the color jeffery w yabuki  president chief executive officer  director thank you thanks everyone for taking time with us this afternoon its
