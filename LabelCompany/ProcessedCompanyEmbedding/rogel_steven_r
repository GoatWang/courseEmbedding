chairman president and chief executive officer awards global ceo of the year paperforest products global outlook conference  address weyerhaeuser company  weyerhaeuser way south federal way washington  httpwwwweyerhaeusercom ■ steven r rogel chairman president and chief executive officer of weyerhaeuser company stirred up a hornets nest when he led weyerhaeusers hostile takeover bid for willamette industries where he had worked until jumping to the bigger company in  the willamette takeover pitted rogel against the smaller companys chairman who had been his mentor for much of the rogels  years with willamette although rogel and weyerhaeuser ultimately prevailed it took more than a year to hammer out a deal acceptable to willamette in the end weyerhaeuser had to raise its bid substantially from the initial offer and rogel had to endure vitriolic attacks from willamettes executives and workers rogels relationship with willamette chairman william swindells—that of protégé and mentor during rogels  years at the oregonbased forestproducts company—had gone sour the day rogel announced his plans to leave and take a job with its bigger rival weyerhaeuser according to stanley steven r rogel apwide world photos  holmes of businessweek  swindells insisted that rogel leave the company immediately and the two had not spoken since despite the bitterness he knew the takeover bid would generate among his onetime colleagues at willamette rogel said he was comforted by his certainty that the acquisition would benefit both companies i slept well at night he told holmes march   i was doing the right thing not just for weyerhaeuser but for good friends at willamette one of americas largest forestproducts companies weyerhaeuser has fared well under rogels leadership in addition to its expansion through the acquisition of willamette the company significantly increased its revenue in the opening years of the new millennium total sales climbed from roughly  billion in  to nearly  billion in  the company harvests timber not only in north america but also from such farflung woodlands as those of australia france ireland new zealand and uruguay weyerhaeuser produces a wide range of forest products including solid wood products pulp and paper containerboard and packaging materials the companys real estate division develops both residential building lots and singlefamily housing for sale asked by paperage editorinchief jack obrien to summarize his business philosophy rogel said i believe that people who are successful must have first a good battle plan and then stick with it march  raised in grain country of eastern washington rogel born in ritzville washington on october   grew up in the graingrowing and livestockraising country of eastern washington after finishing high school in ritzville he enrolled at the university of washington in seattle to study chemical engineering his interest in the forestproducts industry was awakened during a  summer internship at the tacoma kraft mill of st regis paper company rogel told paperage that the experience convinced him of the value of internships they bring you into the real world even though i was a chemical engineer and had opportunities to enter the chemical and oil industries i chose forest products march  in  a year before graduating from the university of washington rogel married connie schuler his high school sweetheart fresh out of college rogel took a job with st regis where he remained until  he next moved to the other side of the continent taking a job as assistant manager at st anne–nackawic pulp and paper in nackawic new brunswick canada two years later he got an offer to work as a technical director in the albany oregon facility of western kraft which was soon to become part of willamette industries thus began a career of about  years with willamette quickly singled out as a promising candidate for a top management position rogel moved rapidly up the ladder at willamette after holding several management positions at the companys albany oregon and campti louisiana mills he was elected a vice president in  nine years later he was named executive vice president and in  he became willamettes president and chief operating officer groomed as a successor to the companys longtime chairman and ceo william swindells rogel took over as willamettes ceo on october   swindells however remained as chairman won praise as willamettes ceo over the next two years rogels leadership of willamette won plaudits from wall street analysts less than a year after taking over as ceo rogel engineered willamettes acquisition of nearly  acres of prime forestland in oregons pacific coast and cascade ranges making the company the biggest private landowner in the state in an interview with hal bernton of the oregonian june   rogel said that his goal for willamette was to be recognized as one of the outstanding companies in the industry not only for financial performance but also for safety environmental policies and contributions to local communities in  willamettes first full year under rogel as ceo the company managed to post net earnings of  million on revenue of  billion despite the impact of soft markets on willamettes paper and pulp mills rogel maintained willamettes wellestablished reputation for strong growth and high rates of return on investment in the five years that ended december   the company generated an average annual rate of return of  percent according to morgan stanley forestproducts analyst matt berler quoted in the oregonian  willamette is the premier company in the pulp and paper industry june   berler added that the company had generated the highest most consistent returns in the industry and … sustained the fastest growth rate although rogel said that he was happy at willamette which for its part seemed pleased with the job he was doing as ceo in  he received an offer he felt that he could not refuse rogel told obrien of paperage march  that he was first approached by jack creighton who was then weyerhaeusers president and ceo and later contacted by george weyerhaeuser sr the companys chairman and greatgrandson of its founder both told rogel they wanted to bring changes to weyerhaeuser and felt that he was the man to do the job this presented a challenge i couldnt resist—the professional challenge of my entire career departure angered willamette executives rogels decision to leave willamette for weyerhaeuser was not at all well received by the formers executives particularly swindells who saw their ceos defection to a larger rival as a betrayal weyerhaeuser for its part was delighted that rogel had been persuaded to join the company as its new president and ceo many observers found the hiring a bit surprising given weyerhaeusers previous record of filling its top executive positions from within however in announcing the appointment creighton made clear that the company had chosen rogel because he is a proven leader at the ceo level according to the seattle postintelligencer november   rogel wasted no time in defining his vision of a new more focused nimble and efficient weyerhaeuser within months of coming on as ceo in december  he took steps to rationalize weyerhaeusers corporate structure began using the companys buying power as leverage in its dealings with major suppliers and put greater emphasis on weyerhaeusers core businesses he also moved quickly to grow the companys holdings acquiring macmillan bloedel a canadian forestproducts company tj international macmillan bloedels partner in trus joist macmillan and three canadian mills owned by bowater willamette taken over the next step in rogels longterm strategy for weyerhaeuser—the acquisition of willamette—revived and intensified all the ill feelings that had first been generated by his decision to leave more than three years earlier in what was to be a lengthy war of wills rogel fired the opening shot on november   when he offered willamettes shareholders  per share for their stock in addition weyerhaeusers offer provided for the assumption of roughly  billion in willamette debt bringing the total value of the offer to about  billion willamettes board quickly rejected the hostile takeover bid hoping to slam the door on weyerhaeusers unwelcome acquisition campaign rogel had no intention of giving up that easily however as he told holmes in businessweek  i knew the takeover bid would be upsetting to them willamette management and come back on me personally march   over the next  months or so the battle got very personal indeed willamette executives taped a picture of rogel to a voodoo doll and stuck pins into it and thousands of willamettes workers wore buttons that read just say no wey despite the personal attacks rogel continued to press the bid weyerhaeusers offer was steadily sweetened eventually reaching  per share which with the assumption of debt brought the total price for willamette to about  billion in january  willamette finally accepted the offer and in march  the company became a wholly owned subsidiary of weyerhaeuser although the standoff between weyerhaeuser and willamette had been unpleasant in the end rogel told paperage  willamette people came with the attitude we may not have wanted this but lets get on with it and make the very best company we can march  to facilitate the integration of his latest acquisition into the weyerhaeuser corporate structure rogel tapped a number of willamette people from throughout the company for management positions at weyerhaeuser concentrating on weyerhaeuser with the willamette acquisition behind him rogel in early  began to focus his energies on making weyerhaeuser lean nimble quick opportunistic according to official board markets april   he told shareholders that the company must reinvent itself to increase both its efficiency and its profitability he suggested that shortterm priorities might include expansion of weyerhaeusers international operations a critical reassessment of its wood and paper operations and redoubled effort to control expenses he told official board markets that company employees had been told youre going to find our workplace of the future fulfilling exciting and rewarding if youre the kind of person who is customerfocused and resultsoriented april   in addition to his responsibilities at weyerhaeuser rogel sat on the boards of various forestproducts industry organizations including the world forestry center wood promotion network and american forest  paper association he also served as a director of kroger company and union pacific corporation and a trustee of pacific university rogel was vice president of administration for the western region of the boy scouts of america in  rogel was picked as global ceo of the year in a survey of forestproducts analysts conducted by pulp  paper and ppi magazines and in  he was named

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
