calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months since brokers often use different ratings systems each rating is

available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve monthsmarketbeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and marketbeat has received a report that coverage was dropped ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods such as
