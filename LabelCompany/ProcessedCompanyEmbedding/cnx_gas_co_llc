centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in which an owner could take out a  salary and  profit the extra taxes on the  would be over  raising money if a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the llc liability protection an important advantage of an llc is that in some states a creditor cannot collect the members’ llc distributions with a corporation creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets but can collect the shareholder’s dividends profits losses and taxes the other advantages of llcs are found in certain tax situations for example an llc can make special allocations of profits and losses among members whereas s corporations cannot s corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership in an llc money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis and lower the taxes of the owners whereas in an s corporation it does not contributing property to set up an llc is not taxable even for minority interest owners whereas for a corporation regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business foreign ownership the owners of an llc can be foreign persons other corporations or any kind of trust whereas the owners of s corporations cannot an llc may have an unlimited number of members while an s corporation is limited to one hundred management options llcs are also popular because of their flexible management options allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations llcs have fewer formalities than corporations another advantage for some business owners fringe benefits corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity various retirement stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations plus sole proprietors partners and employees owning more than  of an s corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits such as groupterm life insurance medical reimbursement plans medical insurance premiums and parking shareholderemployees of a c corporation do

blocking access to the property cnx filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment of the parties rights under the  lease and the right of way agreement  the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in may  the circuit court entered an order the may order granting cnxs motion for summary judgment in that order the circuit court held that the  lease was unambiguous and that all the rights cnx possessed under the lease were exclusive including the rights to construct and maintain all pipelines and all structures on the property and to transport coalseam gas or other gas on over under or through the property the circuit court ordered geomet to remove its pipeline from the property and to cease its transportation of coalseam gas or other gas on over under or through the property geomet and pocahontas appealed the injunctive provisions of the may order to this court under code §  concluding that the may order contained injunctive relief that cnx did not request this court vacated the portion of the order granting injunctive relief and remanded the case to the circuit court the circuit court later certified the remaining provisions of the may order to this court for review under the interlocutory appeal procedures of code §  in accordance with the circuit courts certification geomet and pocahontas seek review in this court of those remaining provisions in the circuit courts award of summary judgment geomet and pocahontas collectively geomet argue that the terms of the  lease are unambiguous geomet asserts that under a plain reading of the lease the term exclusively in the phrase lessor grants leases and lets exclusively unto lessee refers only to the rights to the coalseam gas estate thus geomet contends that in the  lease pocahontas granted to cnx exclusive rights to the coalseam gas together with nonexclusive rights necessary or convenient to develop produce market and sell said coalseam gas geomet cites additional language in the  lease in support of its position that some of the rights granted in the lease are exclusive while other rights granted are nonexclusive geomet points to the language granting the exclusive rights of exploring drilling producing gathering transporting and selling the coalseam gas the rights to construct and maintain all pipelines tanks structures and utility lines emphasis added geomet contends that the omission of the term exclusive with respect to the rights to construct and maintain pipelines tanks structures and utility lines indicates that those rights granted to cnx are not exclusive rights in response cnx agrees that the  lease is unambiguous but contends that under a plain reading of the lease all the rights granted in the lease are exclusive to cnx in support of its argument cnx cites to the lease language that lessor grants leases and lets exclusively unto lessee and argues that the term exclusively governs all the rights granted to cnx in the lease cnx further contends that its interpretation of the term exclusively does not conflict with other terms of the lease because the sole purpose of the lease was to grant to cnx exclusive rights including the exclusive right to transport gas from any source alternatively cnx argues that if the lease terms do not unambiguously grant to cnx such exclusive rights then the disputed lease language must be considered ambiguous and the case must be remanded to the circuit court for the receipt of parol evidence concerning the parties intent when the lease was executed we disagree with cnxs arguments in our analysis of the lease terms we rely on established principles of contract interpretation the question whether a contract is ambiguous presents an issue of law virginia elec  power co v northern virginia regl park auth  va    sed    video zone inc v kf  f props lc  va    sed    utsch v utsch  va    sed    eure v norfolk shipbuilding  drydock corp  va    sed    accordingly on appeal we review the circuit courts

deference to the circuit courts resolution of this question of law because we are afforded the same opportunity as the circuit court to interpret the terms of the parties contract video zone inc  va at   sed at  pyramid dev llc v d  j assocs  va    sed    a courts primary focus in considering disputed contractual language is to determine the parties intention which should be ascertained whenever possible from the language the parties employed in their agreement flippo v csc assocs iii llc  va    sed    langman v alumni assn of the univ of va  va    sed    camp v camp  va    sed    an

same time video zone inc  va at   sed at  tuomala v regent univ  va    sed    galloway corp v sb ballard constr  va    sed    the mere fact that the parties disagree about the meaning of the contracts

determining whether disputed contractual terms are ambiguous we consider the words employed by the parties in accordance with their usual ordinary and popular meaning video zone inc  va at   sed at  haisfield v lape  va    sed    pocahontas mining ltd liab co  va at   sed at  no word or phrase employed in a contract will be treated as meaningless if a reasonable meaning can be assigned to it and

sed    lansdowne development co v xerox realty corp  va    sed    westmorelandlge partners  va at   sed at  langman  va at   sed at  when the writing considered as a whole is clear unambiguous and explicit a court asked to interpret such a document should look no further than the four corners of the instrument virginia elec  power co  va at   sed at  langman  va at   sed at  trailsend land co v virginia holding corp  va    sed    applying these principles we conclude that the disputed lease provisions are unambiguous by selectively identifying certain rights as exclusive while omitting any reference to the term exclusive in describing other rights the lease language signifies the parties clear intention that only some rather than all the stated rights are exclusively granted to cnx the lease gives cnx exclusive rights to the coalseam gas estate including the exclusive rights of exploration drilling production gathering transportation and sale of the coalseam gas the lease also grants to cnx nonexclusive rights including the right to construct and maintain pipelines and other facilities necessary and convenient for the production and transportation of the coalseam gas and of other gas from whatever source  notably the language in the lease granting to cnx rights to construct and maintain pipelines does not limit pocahontas right to use the property for those purposes except to require that pocahontas permit cnx to construct and maintain all pipelines tanks structures and utility lines that cnx may deem necessary and convenient for the production and transportation of the coalseam gas or other gas the language at issue merely details cnxs right to erect pipelines and other facilities and to use those pipelines and facilities for the purposes described in the lease the lease language is not rendered ambiguous by the parties use of the term exclusively which appears at the beginning of the disputed language the parties inclusion of this term merely clarified that pocahontas granted exclusively to cnx all the rights to the coalseam gas underlying the property cnxs more expansive interpretation of the term exclusively is unavailing because acceptance of cnxs position would impermissibly require us to treat as meaningless and redundant the leases later designation of particular rights as exclusive see states selfinsurers  va at   sed at  westmorelandlge partners  va at   sed at  viewed in this context the absence of a term denoting exclusivity in the description of cnxs rights to construct and maintain all pipelines is significant plainly by omitting any reference to an exclusive right in addressing the subject of pipelines on the leased property the parties expressed their intent that such rights of cnx would not be exclusivesee bentley funding group  va at   sed at  first natl bank  va at   sed at  the opposite conclusion urged by cnx is additionally unpersuasive because that conclusion would render inoperative pocahontas reservation of rights to the property for such purposes as the development of oil and noncoalseam gas which would have to be transported from the property through pipelines further under cnxs view of the lease language pocahontas would be precluded from engaging in any activity that was necessary or convenient for cnxs utilization of its interest in the leasehold property irrespective whether pocahontas activities actually caused cnx to suffer any inconvenience or other difficulty such a construction would effect a sweeping evisceration of pocahontas other production rights in the property in contravention of pocahontas express reservation of rights in the lease in sum the clear purpose of the lease was to allow cnx to produce transport and sell the coalseam gas obtained from the property and to transport other gas from whatever source over pocahontas property the disputed lease provisions protect cnxs rights to take such actions as are necessary and convenient to conduct these activities but do not permit cnx to prevent other uses of the land that do not affect cnxs exercise of its stated lease rights for these reasons we will reverse the circuit courts order declaring the parties rights under the  lease and remand the case for such further action as may be required consistent with the principles expressed in this opinion reversed and remanded notes  the entity named in the lease was pocahontas mining company limited partnership llp which later became pocahontas mining limited liability company  although cnx was not a party to the  lease cnx is the successor in interest to pgp the named lessee for purposes of this opinion we will refer to the rights granted under the  lease as rights granted to cnx  additionally cnx sought adjudication of its rights under a deed of easement it entered into with pocahontas in   cnx also argues that in determining the parties intent we should consider a memorandum of lease that was executed contemporaneously with the  lease however because we determine that the  lease was unambiguous we limit our consideration to the four corners of that document see virginia elec  power co  va at   sed at  langman  va at

centerrtrifcorporationrtrifcorporations compared to llcs corporations compared to llcs limited liability companies llcs are one of the newest types of business entities like corporations they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships whether an llc or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business the best comparison here is between an llc and an s corporation because an llc can choose to be taxed as an s corporation social security taxes the owners of the s corporation can take out some profits without social security taxes for a large business in which the owners take out salaries of  or more plus profits there would not be much difference since the social security tax cuts out at that level as of  however for a smaller business in
