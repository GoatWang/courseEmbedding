of benefits and risks the nature of the policy this prospectus describes three types of policies being offered by john hancock a variable whole life policy a variable whole life p  policy and a variable whole life  policy the policies described in this prospectus are available only in new york the minimum death benefit that may be bought is  for the whole life policy  for the whole life p  policy and  for the whole life  policy for the whole life policy and the whole life p  policy all persons insured must meet certain health and other criteria called underwriting standards all persons insured under the whole life  policy must meet preferred risk and nonsmoking underwriting standards all policies may be issued on insured persons between ages of  and  discounts are available to insured persons meeting nonsmoking underwriting criteria the policys primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person the policy is unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle because of the substantial policylevel charges we are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy the value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease daily based upon the investment results of the variable investment options that you choose the amount we pay to the policys beneficiary insured person we call this the death benefit may be similarly affected thats why the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments summary of policy benefits death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person this is called the sum insured when the insured person dies we will pay the death benefit minus any indebtedness the death benefit will be an amount equal to the greater of the guaranteed minimum death benefit and the variable sum insured on the date of death of the insured person the variable sum insured is an amount equal to the initial sum insured at issue and thereafter varies as discussed under variable sum insured surrender of the policy you may surrender the policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy plus any dividends and interest unpaid or unapplied and the cash value of any insurance purchased under any dividend option with an adjustment to reflect the difference between the gross premium and the net premium for the period beyond the date of surrender less any indebtedness this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a surrender if you have not taken a loan on your policy the cash value of your policy assuming you take all dividend payments in cash will on any given date be equal to o the amount you invested o plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen and o minus all charges we deduct if you take a loan on your policy your cash value will be computed somewhat differently this is discussed under policy loans policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by completing the appropriate form the minimum amount of each loan is  the maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula interest is charged on each loan you can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance you can repay all or part of a loan at any time if there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies it will be deducted from the death benefit policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your cash value and may also result in adverse tax consequences  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th optional benefit riders when you apply for the policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we make available there are a number of such riders charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value investment options the policy offers a number of investment options as listed on the cover of this prospectus they cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies although the funds of the series funds that underlie those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds there are important differences between your investment options and publiclytraded mutual funds on the plus side you can transfer money from one investment option to another without tax liability moreover any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you on the negative side if and when policy earnings are distributed generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains also you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options summary of policy risks lapse risk if you dont pay a premium when due you will have a  day grace period to make that payment if you dont pay the premium by the end of the grace period your policy will terminate ie lapse all coverage under the policy will then cease even if the policy terminates in this way you can still reactivate ie reinstate it within  years from the beginning of the grace period unless the surrender value has been paid or otherwise exhausted or the period of any extended term coverage discussed below has expired to reinstate the policy you must make the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions since withdrawals reduce your account value withdrawals increase the risk of lapse loans also increase the risk of lapse investment risk as mentioned above the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad your account value will rise or fall based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen some variable investment options are riskier than others these risks and potential rewards are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the series funds transfer risk there is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the frequency of transfers you can make the limitations on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of investment accounts market timing risk variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences as a result some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing inefficiency whatever the reason longterm investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose the investment options underlying fund to increased portfolio transaction costs andor disrupt the fund managers ability to effectively manage the funds investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objectives and policies both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for longterm investment to discourage disruptive frequent trading activity we impose restrictions on transfers see transfers of existing account value and reserve the right to change suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges see how you communicate with us in addition we reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading including but not limited to i restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period ii restricting the dollar amount of transfers  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th and iii restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts we also reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to longterm investors tax risks in order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance under the internal revenue code your policy must comply with certain requirements of the code we will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods the tax laws also contain a socalled  pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policys death benefit if the limit is violated the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences there are also certain treasury department rules referred to as the investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy if that were determined to be the case you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate in other words you would lose the value of the socalled inside buildup that is a major benefit of life insurance there is also a tax risk associated with policy loans although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time of lapse or surrender this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age you might find yourself having to choose between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary there can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership interests for these and all the other reasons mentioned above we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy

level during the policy month following the determination changes in the variable sum insured for each policy month are computed by a formula filed with the insurance supervisory officials of the

limitations on payment of death benefit if the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods the amount of death benefit we pay will be limited as described in the policy also if an

the charges described under deductions from premium payments below we invest the rest your socalled net premium in the investment options youve elected we invest an amount equal to each net premium for your policy on the date of issue and on each premium due date thereafter even if we actually receive your corresponding premium payment before or after that date over time the amount youve invested in any variable investment option will increase or decrease the same as if you had invested the same amount directly in the corresponding fund of the series fund and had reinvested all fund dividends and distributions in additional fund shares except that we will deduct certain additional charges which will reduce your cash value we describe these charges under description of charges at the policy level annual dividends these policies are participating policies which except while in force as fixed extended term insurance are entitled to the share if any of the divisible surplus which we annually determine and apportion to them any share will be distributed as a dividend payable annually on the policy anniversary beginning not later than the end of the second policy year for the variable whole life  policy and not later than the end of the third policy year for the variable whole life policy and variable whole life p policy dividends under participating policies may be described as refunds of premiums which adjust the cost of a policy to the actual level of cost emerging over time after the policys issue thus participating policies generally have gross premiums which are higher than those for comparable nonparticipating policies if a policy is surrendered before dividends become payable you do not benefit from having a participating policy both federal and state law recognize that dividends are considered to be a refund of a portion of the premium paid and therefore are not treated as income for federal or state income tax purposes dividend illustrations published at the time of issue of a policy reflect the actual recent experience of the issuing insurance company with respect to factors such as interest mortality and expenses state law generally prohibits a company from projecting or estimating future results state law also requires that dividends must be based on surplus after setting aside certain necessary amounts and that such surplus must be apportioned equitably among participating policies in other words in principle and by statute dividends must be based on actual experience and cannot be guaranteed at issue of a policy each year our actuaries analyze the current and recent past experience and compare it to the assumptions used in determining the premium rates at the time of issue some of the more important data studied includes mortality and withdrawal rates investment yield in the general account and actual expenses incurred in administering the policies such data is then allocated to each dividend class eg by year of issue age smoking habits and plan the actuaries then determine what dividends can be equitably apportioned to each policy class and make a recommendation to our board of directors the board of directors which has the ultimate authority to ascertain dividends will vote the amount of surplus to be apportioned to each policy class thereby authorizing the distribution of each years dividend you may in general elect to have any dividend paid or applied under any one of the following options paid in cash applied to premium payments left to accumulate with interest of at least  a year purchase fixed paidup insurance purchase one year term insurance or purchase variable paidup insurance commencement of investment performance any premium payment processed prior to the twentieth day after the policys date of issue will automatically be allocated to the money market b investment option on the later of the date such payment is received or the twentieth day following the date of

restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional limitations noted below subject to the annual restriction noted above our current practice is to restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two per calendar month except with respect to those policies described in the following

close of that business day usually  pm eastern time are considered one transfer you may however transfer to the money market b investment option even if the two transfer per month limit has been reached but only if  of the account value in all variable investment options is transferred to the money market b investment option if such a transfer to the money market b investment option is made then for the  calendar day period after such transfers no transfers from the money market b investment option to any other investment options variable or fixed may be made if your policy offers a dollar cost averaging or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program any transfers pursuant to such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on frequent trading the

to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit plan and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased to match its liabilities under the plan policies sold under these circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions in lieu of the two transfers per month restriction but still subject to the annual restriction noted above we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits i during the  calendar day period after any account values are transferred from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they are transferred into the money market b

will apply to all indebtedness outstanding during the policy year following the date of determination the rate will not exceed the higher of  or the published monthly average as defined below for the calendar month which is two months prior to the month in which the date of determination occurs the published monthly average means moodys corporate bond yield average as published by moodys investors service inc or any successor thereto the amount of the loan deducted from the investment options is placed in a special loan account this special loan account will earn interest at an effective annual rate that is not more than  below the interest rate we are then charging on the loan assuming no taxes repayment of policy loans if you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment you must include instructions to that effect otherwise all payments will be assumed to be premium payments we process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment effects of policy loans the cash value the net cash surrender value and the death benefit are permanently affected by any loan whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part this is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account the investment options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return the amount of any outstanding indebtedness is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the outstanding indebtedness equals or exceeds the policys cash value plus any cash values under a dividend option providing paidup insurance the policy will terminate  days after we have mailed notice of termination to you and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period also taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account policy loans may also result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances see tax considerations  pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st description of charges at the policy level deductions from premium payments o premium tax charge  a charge to cover expected state premium taxes we must pay on average this charge is  of each premium o adjustment for premium payment frequency  if you select a premium payment mode other than annual so that we receive your premiums over the course of the year rather than all at the beginning there will be less value in your policy to support it during the course of the year to compensate for the risk to us that this creates the rate we set for each non annual premium includes an additional amount that we retain rather than crediting it to your policy o annual administrative charge  a charge of  in each policy year to help defray our annual administrative expenses o charge for extra insurance risk  the amount of premiums we may require may include an additional component if the insured person presents particular mortality risks we retain these additional amounts to compensate us for that risk o optional benefits charge  the amount of premiums we require is increased by an additional component to cover any optional rider benefits you choose for your policy we retain such additional amounts to compensate us for the obligations we assume under the riders o premium sales charge  a charge not to exceed  of the basic annual premium during the period equal to the lesser of  years or the anticipated life expectancy of the insured person based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality table the basic annual premium is the annual premium less the premiums for any optional rider benefits additional charges for extra mortality risks and the  annual administrative charge the charge during the first two policy years shall not exceed  of the basic annual premium paid during the first policy year plus  of the basic annual premium paid for the second policy year charges of  or less are made for later policy year o additional first year administrative charge  a charge in the first policy year at the rate of  per  of the initial sum insured as shown in the policy for a variable whole life policy  per  for a variable whole life p policy and  per  for a variable whole life  policy or a pro rata portion thereof to cover administrative expenses in connection with the issuance of the policy o risk charge  a charge necessary to cover the risk we assumed that the variable sum insured will be less than the guaranteed minimum death benefit this charge will vary by age of the insured person but averages approximately  of the basic annual premium o deduction for dividends  a deduction for dividends to be paid or credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date of the policy this deduction will vary by age of the insured person and duration of the policy but is expected to average approximately  of the basic annual premium deductions from account assets o insurance charge  a monthly charge for the cost of insurance to determine the charge we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by a cost of insurance rate the rate is derived from an actuarial table the table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance rates the cost of insurance rates will never be more than those based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables cost of insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy as the insured persons attained age increases the insured persons attained age on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that date o m  e charge  a daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume this charge is deducted from the variable investment options the current charge is at an effective annual rate of  of the value of the assets in each variable investment option we guarantee that this charge will never exceed an effective annual rate of  additional information about how certain policy charges work sales expenses and related charges the premium sales charges help to compensate us for the cost of selling our policies see description of charges at the policy level the amount of the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year we expect to recover our total sales expenses over the life of the policy to the extent that the sales charges do not cover total sales expenses the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains with respect to the policies or from our general assets similarly administrative expenses not  pnd page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust nd fully covered by the annual administrative charge and the additional first year administrative charge may also be recovered from such other sources method of deduction we deduct the monthly charges described in the section from your policys investment options in proportion to the amount of cash value you have in each other charges we could impose in the future we currently make no charge for our federal income taxes however if we incur or expect to incur additional income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the account or this class of policies in future years we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options however we expect that no such charge will be necessary under current laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws we may make charges for such taxes description of charges at the fund level the funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses these fees and expenses shown in the fee tables section are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund therefore they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment options you select expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policy and those expenses may vary from year to year other policy benefits rights and limitations optional benefit riders you can add when you apply for a policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we then make available availability of any rider the benefits it provides and the charges for it may vary by state our rules and procedures will govern eligibility for any rider and in some cases the configuration of the actual rider benefits each rider contains specific details that you should review before you decide to choose the rider we may change rider premiums or the rates that determine them but not above any applicable maximum amount stated in the policy specifications page

with your purchase of a policy tax considerations this description of federal income tax consequences is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances and for further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser federal state and local tax laws regulations and interpretations can change from time to time as a result the tax consequences to you and the beneficiary may be altered in some cases retroactively the policy may be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans retiree medical benefit plans and others the tax consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement therefore if the use of the policy in any such arrangment the value of which depends in part on the tax consequences is contemplated a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advise on the tax attributes of the particular arrangement general generally death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax earnings on your account value are ordinarily not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to you if we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal all or part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and not subjected to income tax however certain distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy benefits within the first  years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily taxable in whole or in part see other policy distributions below amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you see policy loans below however some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract this can happen if youve paid premiums in excess of limits prescribed by the tax laws additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status below policy death benefit proceeds we expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies section  of the internal revenue code the code defines a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes for a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium test these tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the policy we will monitor compliance with these standards if we determine that a policy does not satisfy section  we may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with section  if the policy complies with section  the death benefit proceeds under the policy should be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the code other policy distributions increases in policy value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received through actual or deemed distributions in general the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner in order for the policy to continue to comply with the section  definitional limits changes that reduce benefits include partial withdrawals and death benefit option changes for purposes of this rule any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction a cash distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  the taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section f any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner rather than capital gain distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or partial withdrawals you may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th it is possible that despite our monitoring a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the code this could happen for example if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the code if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the disqualification and for subsequent periods tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws will depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary if the person insured by the policy is also its owner either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a revocabale trust the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for purposes of the federal estate tax if the owner is not the person insured the value of the policy will be includible in the owners estate upon his or her death even if ownership has been transferred the death proceeds or the account value may be includible in the former owners estate if the transfer occurred less than three years before the former owners death or if the former owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy you should consult your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences because there may be unfavorable tax consequences including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income taxfree treatment for any death benefit payable to the beneficiary you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests policy loans we expect that except as noted below see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner however if the policy terminates for any reason the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur diversification rules and ownership of the account your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance contract unless the account follows certain rules requiring diversification of investments underlying the policy in addition the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets in certain circumstances the owner of a variable life insurance policy may be considered the owner for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the separate account used to support the policy in those circumstances income and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy owners gross income the internal revenue service irs has stated in published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets a treasury decision issued in  stated that guidance would be issued in the form of regulations or rulings on the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts of a separate account without being treated as owners of the underlying assets as of the date of this prospectus no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued in rev rul  however the irs ruled that a contract holder would not be treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity contract despite the owners ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty subaccounts the ownership rights under your policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described in irs rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings it is possible that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account we do not know what future treasury department regulations or other guidance may require we cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies we have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account but we are under no obligation to do so  pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status at the time of policy issuance we will determine whether the planned premium schedule will exceed the pay limit discussed below if so our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that fact the pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully paidup after the payment of  equal annual premiums paidup means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity based on certain prescribed assumptions if the total premiums paid at any time during the first  policy years exceed the pay limit the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules o first all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy at such time o second loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from the policy and taxed accordingly pastdue loan interest that is added to the loan amount is treated as an additional loan o third a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution including distributions on surrender from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan o is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age  o is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled or o is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the policy owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary these exceptions to the  additional tax do not apply in situations where the policy is not owned by an individual furthermore any time there is a material change in a policy the policy will begin a new pay testing period as if it were a newlyissued policy the material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment contract are complex in general however the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change generally depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time of such change the policy value at the time of the change and the additional premiums paid into the policy during the seven years starting with the date on which the material change occurs moreover if benefits under a policy are reduced such as a reduction in the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits during the  years in which a pay test is being applied the pay limit will generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits if the premiums paid to date are greater than the recalculated pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment contract rules a policy received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract you should consult your tax advisor if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the pay limit on your policy corporate and hr  retirement plans the policy may be acquired in connection with the funding of retirement plans satisfying the qualification requirements of section  of the code if so the code provisions relating to such plans and life insurance

    independent registered public accounting firm        table of contents summary of benefits and risks the nature of the policy the policys primary purpose is to provide lifetime protection against economic loss due to the death of the insured person the policy is unsuitable as a shortterm savings vehicle because of the substantial policylevel charges and the contingent deferred sales charge we are obligated to pay all amounts promised under the policy the value of the amount you have invested under the policy may increase or decrease daily based on the investment results of the variable investment options that you choose the amount we pay to the policys beneficiary upon the death of the insured person we call this the death benefit may be similarly affected thats why the policy is referred to as a variable life insurance policy we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments we require that your first premium at least equal your first required premium discussed below except as noted in the detailed information section of this prospectus you can make any other premium payments you wish at any time thats why the policy is called a flexible premium policy you can request that we bill you for amounts of premiums that exceed your required premium payments and you can subsequently request that we change the amount that we bill if the life insurance protection is provided under a master group policy the term policy as used in this prospectus refers to the certificate you will be issued and not to the master group policy summary of policy benefits death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person this is called your guaranteed death benefit in the policy this may also be referred to as the sum insured when the insured person dies we will pay the death benefit minus any outstanding loans there are three ways of calculating the death benefit you choose which one you want in the application the three death benefit options are        option   the death benefit will equal the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit or  the minimum insurance amount under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test as described under the minimum insurance amount provision in the detailed information section of this prospectus        option   the death benefit will equal the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit plus your policys excess value if any on the date of death or  the minimum insurance amount under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test        option   the death benefit will equal the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit or  the minimum insurance amount under the cash value accumulation test as described below surrender of the policy you may surrender the policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value of the policy less any outstanding policy debt and less any contingent deferred sales charge and administrative surrender charge that then applies this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a surrender if you have not taken a loan on your policy the account value of your policy will on any given date be equal to        the amount you invested        plus or minus the investment experience of the investment options youve chosen        minus all charges we deduct and        minus all withdrawals you have made if you take a loan on your policy your account value will be computed somewhat differently this is discussed under policy loans partial withdrawals under our current administrative rules you may make a partial withdrawal of your policys excess value if any once in each policy year after the first policy year see excess value and its components each partial withdrawal must be at least    table of contents  there is a  charge for each partial withdrawal we will automatically reduce the account value of your policy by the amount of the withdrawal and the related charge policy loans you may borrow from your policy at any time after the first policy year by completing the appropriate form the minimum amount of each loan is  the maximum amount you can borrow is determined by a formula as described in your policy interest is charged on each loan you can pay the interest or allow it to become part of the outstanding loan balance you can repay all or part of a loan at any time if there is an outstanding loan when the insured person dies it will be deducted from the death benefit policy loans permanently affect the calculation of your account value and may also result in adverse tax consequences optional benefit riders when you apply for the policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we make available there are a number of such riders charges for most riders will be deducted monthly from the policys account value investment options the policy offers a number of investment options as listed on page  of this prospectus these investment options are subaccounts of separate account v the account or separate account a separate account operated by us under michigan law they cover a broad spectrum of investment styles and strategies although the funds of the series funds that underlie those investment options operate like publicly traded mutual funds there are important differences between your investment options and publiclytraded mutual funds you can transfer money from one investment option to another without tax liability moreover any dividends and capital gains distributed by each underlying fund are automatically reinvested and reflected in the funds value and create no taxable event for you if and when policy earnings are distributed generally as a result of a surrender or partial withdrawal they will be treated as ordinary income instead of as capital gains also you must keep in mind that you are purchasing an insurance policy and you will be assessed charges at the policy level as well as at the fund level such policy level charges are significant and will reduce the investment performance of your investment options summary of policy risks lapse risk if your policy enters a grace period we will notify you of how much you will need to pay to keep the policy in force you will have a grace period of at least  days after we mail the notice to make that payment if you dont pay at least the required amount by the end of the grace period your policy will terminate ie lapse if lapse occurs youll be given the opportunity to reinstate the policy by making the required premium payments and satisfying certain other conditions since withdrawals reduce your account value withdrawals increase the risk of lapse loans also increase the risk of lapse premium recalculation risk if you do not request a premium recalculation as described under premium recalculation prior to the policy anniversary nearest the insured persons th birthday or if later the ninth policy anniversary then we will automatically perform the recalculation at the next policy anniversary the recalculated base policy premium may be higher than the previous base policy premium investment risk as mentioned above the investment performance of any variable investment option may be good or bad your account value will rise or fall based on the investment performance of the variable investment options youve chosen some variable investment options are riskier than others these risks and potential rewards are discussed in detail in the attached prospectuses of the series funds    table of contents access to funds risk there is a risk that you will not be able or willing to access your account value by surrendering the policy because of the contingent deferred sales charge cdsc that may be payable upon surrender the cdsc is a percentage of the premiums youve paid and disappears only after  policy years have passed see the fee tables section of this prospectus for details on the cdsc there is also a charge for each partial withdrawal you make it is usually  any communication that arrives on a date that is not a business day will be processed on the business day next following that date the term business day is defined under your investment options transfer risk there is a risk that you will not be able to transfer your account value from one investment option to another because of limitations on the number of options you can invest in at one time the limitations on transfers out of the fixed account are more restrictive than those that apply to transfers out of investment accounts market timing risk variable investment options in variable life insurance products can be a prime target for abusive transfer activity because these products value their variable investment options on a daily basis and allow transfers among variable investment options without immediate tax consequences as a result some investors may seek to frequently transfer into and out of variable investment options in reaction to market news or to exploit a perceived pricing inefficiency whatever the reason longterm investors in a variable investment option can be harmed by frequent transfer activity since such activity may expose the investment options underlying fund to increased portfolio transaction costs andor disrupt the fund managers ability to effectively manage the funds investment portfolio in accordance with the funds investment objectives and policies both of which may result in dilution with respect to interests held for longterm investment to discourage disruptive frequent trading activity we impose restrictions on transfers see transfers of existing account value and reserve the right to change suspend or terminate telephone and facsimile transaction privileges see how you communicate with us in addition we reserve the right to take other actions at any time to restrict trading including but not limited to i restricting the number of transfers made during a defined period ii restricting the dollar amount of transfers and iii restricting transfers into and out of certain investment accounts we also reserve the right to defer a transfer at any time we are unable to purchase or redeem shares of the underlying fund while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to longterm investors tax risks life insurance death benefits are ordinarily not subject to income tax other federal and state taxes may apply as further discussed below in general you will be taxed on the amount of lifetime distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy any taxable distribution will be treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gains for tax purposes in order for you to receive the tax benefits extended to life insurance under the internal revenue code the code your policy must comply with certain requirements of the code we will monitor your policy for compliance with these requirements but a policy might fail to qualify as life insurance in spite of our monitoring if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to your policy for the period of disqualification and all subsequent periods the tax laws also contain a socalled pay limit that limits the amount of premium that can be paid in relation to the policys death benefit if the limit is violated the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences there are also certain treasury department rules referred to as the investor control rules that determine whether you would be treated as the owner of the assets underlying your policy if that were determined to be the case you would be taxed on any income or gains those assets generate in other words you would lose the value of the socalled inside buildup that is a major benefit of life insurance there is also a tax risk associated with policy loans although no part of a loan is treated as income to you when the loan is made surrender or lapse of the policy would result in the loan being treated as a distribution at the time of lapse or surrender this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans and an insured person of advanced age you might find yourself having to choose between high premium requirements to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur    table of contents tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws can vary greatly depending upon the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary there can also be unfavorable tax consequences on such things as the change of policy ownership or assignment of ownership interests for these and all the other reasons mentioned above we recommend you consult with a qualified tax adviser before buying the policy and before exercising certain rights under the policy    table of contents fee tables this section contains five tables that describe all of the fees and expenses that you will pay when buying owning and surrendering the policy in the first three tables certain entries show the minimum charge the maximum charge and the charge for a representative insured person other entries show only the maximum charge we can assess and are labeled as such the

statements made in prospectuses premiums premium payments we call the investments you make in the policy premiums or premium payments we require that your first premium at least equal your first required premium discussed below except as noted below you can make any other premium payments you wish at any time you can request that we bill you for amounts of premiums that exceed your required premium payments and you can subsequently request that we change the amount that we bill maximum premium payments if you have chosen the option  or option  death benefit see the death benefit federal tax law limits the amount of premium payments you can make relative to the amount of your policys insurance coverage we will not knowingly accept any amount by which a premium payment exceeds the maximum if you exceed certain other limits the law may impose a penalty on amounts you take out of your policy well monitor your premium payments and let you know if youre about to exceed this limit see tax considerations also we may refuse to accept any amount of an additional premium if        that amount of premium would increase our insurance risk exposure and the insured person doesnt provide us with adequate evidence that he or she continues to meet our requirements for issuing insurance or        that amount of premium would cause the cumulative premiums you have paid to date to exceed the cumulative scheduled premiums due to date under the policy in no event however will we refuse to accept any premium necessary to prevent the policy from terminating required premiums the policy specifications page of your policy will show the required premium for the policy in the policy application you will choose one of the following modes of premium payment  annual semiannual quarterly or    table of contents monthly we make no additional charge for any of these choices of payment mode you can request that we change your payment mode at any time the scheduled date on which such a payment is due is referred to in the policy as a modal processing date premiums are scheduled to be paid for the whole of the insured persons lifetime if on any modal processing date the cumulative amount of all premium payments you have made does not equal or exceed the cumulative amount of all required premiums due through that date your policy will enter a grace period unless your policy has excess value as of that date for purposes of determining whether enough premiums have been paid as of any modal processing date we reduce the amount of premiums you have paid by the amount of any withdrawals you have taken from what we consider to be the premium component of any excess value in your policy see below excess value and its components as of the last business day in each policy month we compare the account value of the policy against the basic account value described below to determine if any excess value exists under the policy excess value is any amount of account value greater than the basic account value if you wish to know the amount of excess value at any time just contact our servicing office the basic account value generally increases over the life of the policy as the attained age of the insured person increases basic account value can be thought of as what the guaranteed cash value would be under an otherwise comparable nonvariable whole life policy it is the amount we deem necessary to support your policys benefits at any time based on accepted actuarial methods and assumptions see how we calculate basic account value below for further details excess value may arise from two sources the premium component is that portion of excess value up to the amount by which the cumulative premiums paid excluding amounts from this component previously withdrawn exceed the cumulative amount of required premiums due to date the experience component is that portion of excess value above the premium component and arises out of favorable investment experience or lower than maximum insurance and expense charges how we calculate basic account value the basic account value at any time is what the policys account value would have been at that time if  level annual premiums and no additional premiums had been paid in the amount of the maximum guaranteed recalculation premium at issue and earned a constant net return of  per annum and  the cost of insurance charges had been deducted at the maximum rates set forth in the policy and no other charges the maximum guaranteed recalculation premium at issue is described under premium recalculation and its amount is specified in each policy notwithstanding the foregoing if there is a policy loan outstanding the basic account value will not be less than  of the outstanding loan also in all cases where optional rider benefits have been selected or the insured person is in a substandard risk category an additional amount will be added in computing the basic account value to cover these items through the end of the thencurrent policy year lapse if your policy enters a grace period we will notify you of how much you will need to pay to keep the policy in force you will have a grace period of at least  days after we mail the notice to make that payment if you dont pay at least the required amount by the end of the grace period your policy will terminate ie lapse if the insured person dies during the grace period we will deduct any unpaid monthly charges from the death benefit during the grace period you cannot make transfers among investment options or make a partial withdrawal or policy loan options on lapse if a policy lapses we apply the surrender value on the date of lapse to one of three options for continued insurance that does not require further payment of premium variable paidup insurance fixed paidup insurance or fixed extended term insurance on the life of the insured person commencing on the date of lapse both the variable and fixed paidup insurance options provide an amount of paidup whole life insurance determined in accordance with the policy which the surrender value will purchase the amount of variable paidup insurance may then increase or decrease subject to any guarantee in response to the investment experience of the variable investment options the fixed paidup insurance option provides a fixed and level amount of insurance the fixed extended term insurance    table of contents option provides a fixed amount of insurance determined in accordance with the policy with the insurance coverage continuing for as long a period as the available policy surrender value will purchase the variable paidup insurance option is not available unless its initial amount is at least  if you have elected no option before the end of the grace period the fixed extended term insurance option automatically applies unless the amount of fixed paidup insurance would equal or exceed the amount of fixed extended term insurance or unless the insured person is a substandard risk in either of the latter cases fixed paidup insurance is provided you may surrender a policy that is being continued under any of these options for the options surrender value while the insured person is living loans may be available under the variable and fixed paidup insurance options reinstatement you can still reactivate ie reinstate a lapsed policy within  years from the beginning of the grace period unless the surrender value has been paid out or otherwise exhausted or the period of any fixed extended term insurance has expired you will have to provide evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements for issuing coverage you will also have to pay a minimum amount of premium and be subject to the other terms and conditions applicable to reinstatements as specified in the policy amount of required premiums we initially determine the amount of your scheduled premium at the time your policy is issued in accordance with our established rules and rates it consists of a base policy premium plus certain additional amounts if the insured person presents an extra mortality risk to us or if you have purchased certain additional insurance benefits these amounts will be set forth in the policy specifications section of your policy as the components of your required premium the base policy premium is the amount of the required premium for an insured person in the standard underwriting risk class who has not purchased any additional insurance benefits by rider the base policy premium will not change until the required premium recalculation discussed below or until such time as you partially surrender the policy premium recalculation you may make a onetime request that we recalculate your base policy premium at any time not later than the policy anniversary nearest the insured persons th birthday or if later the ninth policy anniversary the base policy premium that results from the recalculation will apply to all periods subsequent to the recalculation that resulting base policy premium may be higher or lower than or the same as the previous base policy premium this in turn will determine whether the required premium will be higher lower or stay the same for those subsequent periods if your right to request a premium recalculation expires without your having exercised it we will automatically perform the premium recalculation at the next policy anniversary the premium recalculation feature makes it possible for us to set a lower base policy premium and thus a lower required premium at the time the policy is issued than would be possible without this feature if you wish to lock in a base policy premium and required premium at any time prior to the features expiration you can do so by requesting a premium recalculation the amount of the new base policy premium after a premium recalculation depends on the insured persons sex smoking status attained age the guaranteed death benefit under the policy and the account value at the close of the business day that precedes the recalculation the new base policy premium will never exceed the policys guaranteed maximum recalculation premium based on the insured persons attained age at the time of the recalculation the guaranteed maximum recalculation premium for each attained age will appear in the policy specifications section of your policy the guaranteed maximum recalculation premium increases as the insured persons attained age increases accordingly by delaying the premium recalculation you assume the risk that the base policy premium following the recalculation will be higher than it would have been had the recalculation been performed at an earlier date the longer the delay and the lower the policys account value the greater the risk on the other hand by postponing the premium recalculation you may benefit from  a lower base policy premium prior to the recalculation and  a longer period to accumulate enough account value to reduce the possibility or amount of an increase in the base policy premium at the time of the recalculation    table of contents if your policy has any excess value at the time of the premium recalculation the base policy premium will be less following the recalculation than it would have been had the recalculation been performed at the earliest possible date ie at the time of policy issuance otherwise it will be more as an example consider a policy issued to a male standard risk nonsmoker age  at issue with death benefit option  in the amount of  and assuming current charge rates if no premium recalculation is made at policy issuance the base policy premium for the policy would be  until such time as the premium recalculation is made assuming that amount of premium is paid annually until the premium recalculation and assuming constant gross annual investment returns at the rates set forth below the following table illustrates what the base policy premium would be following a recalculation on the dates shown   policy anniversary of premium recalculation

                            mandatory premium recalculation if you do not choose earlier date we will make a onetime charge if the new base policy premium is less than the guaranteed maximum recalculation premium that would have applied had the recalculation been done at the time the policy was issued the charge will not exceed  currently       of the policys excess value exceeds at the time of the premium recalculation see guaranteed death benefit charge the amount of any account value that is considered excess value under your policy may increase or decrease as a result of a premium recalculation see excess value and its components above ways to pay premiums if you pay premiums by check or money order they must be drawn on a us bank in us dollars and made payable to john hancock life we will not accept credit card checks we will not accept starter or third party checks if they fail to satisfy our administrative requirements premiums after the first must be sent to our service office at the appropriate address shown on the back cover of this prospectus we will also accept premiums        by wire or by exchange from another insurance company        via an electronic funds transfer program any owner interested in making monthly premium payments must use this method or        if we agree to it through a salary deduction plan with your employer you can obtain information on these other methods of premium payment by contacting your john hancock usa representative or by contacting our service office processing premium payments we will process any premium payment as of the day we receive it unless one of the following exceptions applies  we will process a payment received prior to a policys date of issue as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue  if you pay a sufficient premium to take your policy out of a grace period the portion of such premium that equals the overdue required premium will be processed as of that required premiums due date    table of contents  if the first required premium is not received prior to the date of issue we will process each premium payment received thereafter as if received on the business day immediately preceding the date of issue until all of the first required premium is received  we will process the portion of any premium payment for which we require evidence of the insured persons continued insurability only after we have received such evidence and found it satisfactory to us  if we receive any premium payment that we think will cause a policy to become a modified endowment or will cause a policy to lose its status as life insurance under the tax laws we will not accept the excess portion of that premium payment and will immediately notify the owner we will refund the excess premium when the premium payment check has had time to clear the banking system but in no case more than two weeks after receipt except in the following circumstances        the tax problem resolves itself prior to the date the refund is to be made or        the tax problem relates to modified endowment contract status and we receive a signed acknowledgment from the owner prior to the refund date instructing us to process the premium notwithstanding the tax issues involved in the above cases we will treat the excess premium as having been received on the date the tax problem resolves itself or the date we receive the signed acknowledgment we will then process it accordingly  if a premium payment is received or is otherwise scheduled to be processed as specified above on a date that is not a business day the premium payment will be processed on the business day next following that date the death benefit in your application for the policy you will tell us how much life insurance coverage you want on the life of the insured person this is called your guaranteed death benefit in the policy this may also be referred to as the sum insured when the insured person dies we will pay the death benefit minus any outstanding loans there are  ways of calculating the death benefit you must choose which one you want in the application the three death benefit options are        option   the death benefit will equal the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit or  the minimum insurance amount under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test as described below        option   the death benefit will equal the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit plus your policys excess value if any on the date of death or  the minimum insurance amount under the guideline premium and cash value corridor test        option   the death benefit will equal the greater of  the guaranteed death benefit or  the minimum insurance amount under the cash value accumulation test as described below for the same premium payments the death benefit under option  will tend to be higher than the death benefit under options  or  on the other hand the monthly insurance charge will be higher under option  to compensate us for the additional insurance risk because of that the account value will tend to be higher under options  or  than under option  for the same premium payments limitations on payment of death benefit if the insured person commits suicide within certain time periods generally within two years from the issue date of the policy the amount payable will be equal to the premiums paid less the amount of any policy debt on the date of death and less any withdrawals unless otherwise provided by your policy also if an application misstated the age or sex of either of the insured persons we will adjust if necessary the base face amount any supplemental face amount and every other benefit to that which would have been purchased at the correct age or sex by the most recent cost of insurance charges or as otherwise provided by your policy the minimum insurance amount in order for a policy to qualify as life insurance under federal tax law there has to be a minimum amount of insurance in relation to account value there are two tests that can be applied under federal tax law death benefit options  and  use the guideline premium and cash value corridor test while option  uses the cash value accumulation test for options  and  we compute the minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value on that date by the socalled corridor factor applicable on that date the corridor factors are derived by applying the guideline premium and cash    table of contents value corridor test the corridor factor starts out at  for ages at or below  and decreases as attained age increases reaching a low of  at age  a table showing the factor for each age will appear in the policy for option  we compute the minimum insurance amount each business day by multiplying the account value on that date by the socalled death benefit factor applicable on that date the death benefit factors are derived by applying the cash value accumulation test the death benefit factor decreases as attained age increases a table showing the factor for each age will appear in the policy change of sum insured you may request a decrease in your sum insured at any time subject to our administrative rules in effect at the time if approved any such decrease will be effective on the monthly processing date next following our receipt of the request a pro rata portion of any contingent deferred sales charge will be deducted from your account value as a result of any such decrease under our current administrative rules you cannot request an increase in your sum insured change of death benefit option on any policy anniversary after the first you may request to change your coverage from death benefit option  to option  or viceversa if you request a change from option  to option  we will require evidence that the insured person still meets our requirements for issuing coverage this is because such a change increases our insurance risk exposure if you have chosen death benefit option  you can never change to either option  or option  partial surrenders you may partially surrender your policy upon submission of a written request satisfactory to us in accordance with our rules currently the policy after partial surrender must have a guaranteed death benefit at least as large as the minimum amount for which we would issue a policy on the life of the insured person the required premium for the policy will be adjusted to prospectively reflect the new guaranteed death benefit a prorata portion of the account value will be paid to you and a prorata portion of any contingent deferred sales charge and any administrative surrender charge will be deducted possible alternatives to the partial surrender of the policy would be withdrawal of some or all of your excess value or taking a policy loan effective date of certain policy transactions the

either as a whole number percentage or as a specific dollar amount a confirmation of each transfer will be sent to you the policies are not designed for professional market timing organizations or

and out of variable investment options and to impose a charge of up to  for any transfer beyond an annual limit which will not be less than  under our current rules we impose no charge on transfers but we do impose the following restrictions on transfers into and out of variable investment options transfers out of a fixed investment option are subject to additional limitations noted below our current practice is to restrict transfers into or out of variable investment options to two per calendar month except with respect to those policies described in the following paragraphs for purposes of this restriction and in applying the limitation on the number of free transfers made during the period from the opening of a business day usually  am eastern time to the close of that business day usually  pm eastern time are considered one transfer you may however transfer to the money market b investment option even if the two transfer per month limit has been reached but only if  of the account value in all variable investment options is transferred to the money market b investment option if such a transfer to the money market b investment option is made then for the  calendar day period after such transfers no transfers from the money market b investment option to any other investment options variable or fixed may be made if your policy offers a dollar cost averaging or automatic asset allocation rebalancing program any transfers pursuant to such program are not considered transfers subject to these restrictions on frequent trading the restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions policies such as yours may be purchased by a corporation or other entity as a means to informally finance the liabilities created by an employee benefit plan and to this end the entity may aggregately manage the policies purchased to match its liabilities under the plan policies sold under these circumstances are subject to special transfer restrictions in lieu of the two transfers per month restriction we will allow the policy owner under these circumstances to rebalance the investment options in its policies within the following limits i during the  calendar day period after any account values are transferred from one variable investment option into a second variable investment option the values can only be transferred out of the second investment option if they are transferred into the money market b investment option and ii any account values that would otherwise not be transferable by application of the  day limit described above and that are transferred into the money market b investment option may not be transferred out of the money market b investment option into any other investment options variable or fixed for  calendar days the restrictions described in this paragraph will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions if we change any of the above rules relating to transfers we will notify you of the change subject to our approval we may offer policies purchased by a corporation or other entity that has purchased policies tp match its liabilities under an employee benefit plan as described above the ability to electronically rebalance the investment options in its policies under these circumstances in lieu of imposing any specific limit upon the number or timing of transfers we will monitor aggregate trades among the subaccounts for frequency pattern and size for potentially harmful investment practices if we detect trading activity that we believe may be harmful to the overall operation of any investment account or underlying portfolio we may impose conditions on policies employing electronic rebalancing to submit trades including setting limits upon the number and timing of transfers and revoking privileges to make trades by any means other than written communication submitted via us mail while we seek to identify and prevent disruptive frequent trading activity it may not always be possible to do so therefore no assurance can be given that the restrictions we impose will be successful in preventing all disruptive frequent trading and avoiding harm to longterm investors the restrictions described in these paragraphs will be applied uniformly to all policy owners subject to the restrictions    table of contents rule c under the  act requires us to provide tax identification numbers and other policy owner transaction information to the trust or to other investment companies in which the separate account invests at their request an investment company will use this information to identify any pattern or frequency of investment account transfers that may violate their frequent trading policy an investment company may require us to impose trading restrictions in addition to those described above if violations of their frequent trading policy are discovered transfers out of a fixed investment option are currently subject to the following restrictions        you can only make such a transfer once a year and only during the  day period following your policy anniversary        we must receive the request for such a transfer during the period beginning  days prior to the policy anniversary and ending  days after it        the most you can transfer at any one time is the greater of  or  of the assets in your fixed investment option we reserve the right to impose a minimum amount limit on transfers out of the fixed investment option limitation on number of investment options whether through the allocation of premium or through the transfer of existing account value you can never be invested in more than ten investment options at any one time surrender and partial withdrawals full surrender you may surrender your policy in full at any time if you do we will pay you the account value less any policy debt and less any cdsc and administrative surrender charge that then applies this is called your surrender value you must return your policy when you request a full surrender we process surrenders as of the day we receive the surrender request partial withdrawal

of each loan is  unless the loan is used to pay premiums the interest charged on any loan is an effective annual rate of  accrued interest will be added to the loan daily and will bear interest at the same rate as the original loan amount the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options in the same proportion as the account value is then allocated among them and is placed in a special loan account this special loan account will earn interest at an effective annual rate of  for the first  policy years and  thereafter the tax consequences of a loan interest credited differential of  are unclear you should consult a tax adviser before effecting a loan to evaluate possible tax consequences if we determine that a loan will be treated as a taxable distribution because of the differential between the loan interest rate and the rate being credited on the special loan account we reserve the right to decrease the rate credited on the special loan account to a rate that would in our reasonable judgement result in the transaction being treated as a loan under    table of contents federal tax law the right to increase the rate charged on the loan is restricted in some states please see your john hancock usa representative for details we process policy loans as of the day we receive the loan request repayment of policy loans you can repay all or part of a loan at any time each repayment will be allocated among the investment options as follows        the same proportionate part of the loan as was borrowed from the fixed investment option will be repaid to the fixed investment option        the remainder of the repayment will be allocated among the investment options in the same way a new premium payment would be allocated if you want a payment to be used as a loan repayment you must include instructions to that effect otherwise all payments will be assumed to be premium payments we process loan repayments as of the day we receive the repayment effects of policy loans the account value the net cash surrender value and any death benefit above the total sum insured are permanently affected by any loan whether or not it is repaid in whole or in part this is because the amount of the loan is deducted from the investment options and placed in a special loan account the investment options and the special loan account will generally have different rates of investment return the amount of the outstanding loan which includes accrued and unpaid interest is subtracted from the amount otherwise payable when the policy proceeds become payable whenever the outstanding loan exceeds the surrender value the policy will terminate  days after we have mailed notice of termination to you and to any assignee of record at such assignees last known address specifying the minimum amount that must be paid to avoid termination unless a repayment of at least the amount specified is made within that period also taking out a loan on the policy increases the risk that the policy may lapse because of the difference between the interest rate charged on the loan and the interest rate credited to the special loan account policy loans may also result in adverse tax consequences under certain circumstances see tax considerations description of charges at the policy level deductions from premium payments        premium tax charge  a charge to cover state premium taxes we currently expect to pay on average this charge is currently  of each premium        dac tax charge  a charge to cover the increased federal income tax burden that we currently expect will result from receipt of premiums this charge is currently  of each premium        premium sales charge  a charge to help defray our sales costs the charge is  of the premiums you pay each policy year that do not total more than the required premium for that policy year we currently waive  of this charge for policies with a guaranteed death benefit of  or higher but continuation of that waiver is not guaranteed also we currently intend to stop making this charge on premiums received after the th policy year but this is not guaranteed either deductions from account value        issue charge  a monthly charge to help defray our administrative costs this is a flat dollar charge of  and is deducted only during the first policy year        maintenance charge  a monthly charge to help defray our administrative costs this is a flat dollar charge of up to  currently         insurance charge  a monthly charge for the cost of insurance to determine the charge we multiply the amount of insurance for which we are at risk by a cost of insurance rate the rate is derived from an actuarial table the table in your policy will show the maximum cost of insurance rates the cost of insurance rates that we currently apply are generally less than the maximum rates we will review the cost of insurance rates at least every  years and may change them from time to time however those rates will never be more than rates based on the  commissioners    table of contents   standard ordinary mortality tables the table of rates we use will depend on the insurance risk characteristics and usually gender of the insured person the guaranteed death benefit and the length of time the policy has been in effect regardless of the table used cost of insurance rates generally increase each year that you own your policy as the insured persons attained age increases the insured persons attained age on any date is his or her age on the birthday nearest that date if the guaranteed death benefit at issue is  or more the insured person may be eligible for the preferred underwriting class which has the lowest cost of insurance charges for policies of this type in addition we currently apply a lower insurance charge for policies with a guaranteed death benefit of  or higher but continuation of that practice is not guaranteed also it is our current intention to reduce the insurance charge in the th policy year and thereafter below what it otherwise would be but such a reduction is not guaranteed either        guaranteed death benefit charge  a monthly charge for our guarantee that the death benefit will never be less than the guaranteed death benefit this charge is currently ¢ per  of the guaranteed death benefit at the time the charge is deducted we guarantee that this charge will never exceed ¢ per  of the guaranteed death benefit at the time the charge is deducted        extra mortality risk charge  an insured person who does not qualify for either the preferred or standard underwriting class must pay an additional required premium because of the extra mortality risk we collect this additional premium in two ways up to  of the additional premium is deducted from premiums when paid and the remainder of the additional premium is deducted monthly from your policys account value in equal installments        m  e charge  a daily charge for mortality and expense risks we assume this charge is deducted from the variable investment options it does not apply to the fixed investment option the current charge is at an effective annual rate of  of the value of the assets in each variable investment option we guarantee that this charge will never exceed an effective annual rate of         optional insurance benefits charges  an additional required premium must be paid if you elect to purchase any additional insurance benefit that is added to the policy by means of a rider        premium recalculation charge  when we perform any recalculation as described in the subsection titled premium recalculation we deduct a onetime charge in the amount described in that subsection        administrative surrender charge  a charge we deduct if the policy lapses or is surrendered in the first  policy years we deduct this charge to compensate us for administrative expenses that we would otherwise not recover in the event of early lapse or surrender the amount of the charge depends upon the policy year in which lapse or surrender occurs and the policys guaranteed death benefit at that time the maximum charge is  per  of the policys guaranteed death benefit in policy years  through   per  in policy years  and  and  per  in policy year  for insured persons age  or less at issue this charge will never be more than  and will be charged only in the first four policy years currently a policy with a guaranteed death benefit at time of surrender or lapse of  or more is not charged a policy of less than  guaranteed death benefit at time of surrender or lapse is not currently charged if the surrender or lapse is after the fourth policy year and is charged no more than  if the surrender or lapse is in the first four policy years we may withdraw or modify these lower current charges at any time        contingent deferred sales charge cdsc  a charge we deduct if the policy lapses or is surrendered within the first thirteen policy years a prorata portion of the charge is deducted in the event of a decrease in the sum insured we deduct this charge to compensate us for sales expenses that we would otherwise not recover in the event of early lapse or surrender the cdsc is a percentage of the lesser of a the total amount of premiums you have actually paid before the date of surrender or lapse and b the sum of the base policy premiums due whether or not actually paid on or before the date of surrender or lapse for this purpose base policy premiums are prorated through the end of the policy month in which the surrender or lapse occurs    table of contents for surrenders or lapses effective during    maximum contingent deferred sales charge as a percentage of base policy premiums due through effective date of surrender or lapse policy years      policy year      policy year      policy year        policy year        policy year        policy year        policy year        policy year  and later             the amount of the cdsc is calculated on the basis of the base policy premium for the attained age of the insured person at the time the policy is issued the base policy premium that we use to compute the cdsc is not affected by  any recalculation of the type referred to under premium recalculation or  the nonmandatory character of any required premium due to excess value in the policy on that premiums due date the cdsc as reflected in the above table reaches its maximum at the end of the sixth policy year and is reduced in each policy year thereafter until it reaches zero in policy year  at issue ages higher than  the maximum is reached at an earlier policy year and may be reduced to zero over a shorter number of years        partial withdrawal charge  a charge of  for each partial withdrawal of excess value to compensate us for the administrative expenses of processing the withdrawal loan interest rate the maximum loan interest charged on any loan is shown in the fee tables and described under policy loans in this prospectus additional information about how certain policy charges work sales expenses and related charges the sales charges ie the premium sales charge and the cdsc help to compensate us for the cost of selling our policies see description of charges at the policy level the amount of the charges in any policy year does not specifically correspond to sales expenses for that year we expect to recover our total sales expenses over the life of the policy to the extent that the sales charges do not cover total sales expenses the sales expenses may be recovered from other sources including gains from the charge for mortality and expense risks and other gains with respect to the policies or from our general assets similarly administrative expenses not fully recovered by the issue charge and the maintenance charge may also be recovered from such other sources effect of premium payment pattern you may structure the timing and amount of premium payments to minimize the sales charges although doing so involves certain risks paying more than one required premium in any policy year could reduce your total sales charges for example if you paid a required premium of  in each of the first two policy years you would pay total premium sales charges of  if instead you paid  ie two times the required premium amount in the first policy year you would pay total premium sales charges of only  accelerating the payment of required premiums to earlier policy years could result in a larger cdsc andor cause aggregate premiums paid to exceed the policys pay premium limit and as a result cause the policy to become a modified endowment contract with adverse tax consequences to you upon receipt of policy distributions see tax consequences on the other hand to pay less than the amount of required premiums by their due dates runs the risk that the policy will lapse resulting in loss of coverage and additional charges method of deduction we deduct the monthly charges described in the fee tables section and any cdsc from your policys investment options in proportion to the amount of account value you have in each for each month that we cannot deduct any charge because of insufficient account value the uncollected charges will accumulate and be deducted when and if sufficient account value becomes available    table of contents the insurance under the policy continues in full force during any grace period but if the insured person dies during the policy grace period the amount of unpaid monthly charges is deducted from the death benefit otherwise payable reduced charges for eligible classes the charges otherwise applicable may be reduced with respect to policies issued to a class of associated individuals or to a trustee employer or similar entity where we anticipate that the sales to the members of the class will result in lower than normal sales or administrative expenses lower taxes or lower risks to us we will make these reductions in accordance with our rules in effect at the time of the application for a policy the factors we consider in determining the eligibility of a particular group for reduced charges and the level of the reduction are as follows the nature of the association and its organizational framework the method by which sales will be made to the members of the class the facility with which premiums will be collected from the associated individuals and the associations capabilities with respect to administrative tasks the anticipated lapse and surrender rates of the policies the size of the class of associated individuals and the number of years it has been in existence and any other such circumstances which result in a reduction in sales or administrative expenses lower taxes or lower risks any reduction in charges will be reasonable and will apply uniformly to all prospective policy purchasers in the class and will not unfairly discriminate against any owner other charges we could impose in the future except for the dac tax charge we currently make no charge for our federal income taxes however if we incur or expect to incur income taxes attributable to any subaccount of the account or this class of policies in future years we reserve the right to make a charge for such taxes any such charge would reduce what you earn on any affected investment options however we expect that no such charge will be necessary we also reserve the right to increase the premium tax charge and the dac tax charge in order to correspond respectively with changes in the state premium tax levels or in the federal income tax treatment of the deferred acquisition costs for this type of policy under current laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws we may make charges for such taxes description of charges at the fund level the funds must pay investment management fees and other operating expenses these fees and expenses shown in the fee tables section are different for each fund and reduce the investment return of each fund therefore they also indirectly reduce the return you will earn on any variable investment options you select expenses of the funds are not fixed or specified under the terms of the policy and those expenses may vary from year to year other policy benefits rights and limitations optional benefit riders you can add when you apply for a policy you can request any of the optional benefit riders that we then make available availability of any rider the benefits it provides and the charges for it may vary by state our rules and procedures will govern eligibility for any rider and in some cases the configuration of the actual rider benefits each rider contains specific details that you should review before you decide to choose the rider charges for most riders will be deducted from the policys account value we may change these charges or the rates that determine them but not above any applicable maximum amount stated in the policy specifications page of your policy we may add to delete from or modify the following list of optional benefit riders        insured or spouse yrt rider  this rider provides a level or decreasing amount of term insurance on the life of the insured person or the insured persons spouse the benefit is payable if the person insured under the rider dies during the term period in applying for this rider you must choose the term period and whether the coverage amount is level or decreasing        childrens insurance benefit rider  this rider covers children of the insured person at the time of application and children born or adopted after the rider is purchased for coverage to begin on any child he or she must be more than  days old and less than  years old coverage will continue until the earliest of i termination of the rider upon request ii lapse of the policy iii the insured persons th birthday iv election to convert to permanent coverage    table of contents   on the childs th birthday or v the childs nd birthday since we dont know which children are covered at any point in time it is up to you to terminate the rider if it no longer suits your needs        accidental death benefit rider  this rider provides for an additional

terms insurance laws and regulations apply to us in every state in which our policies are sold as a result terms and conditions of your insurance coverage may vary depending on where you purchase a policy we disclose all material variations in this prospectus we may vary the charges and other terms of our policies where special circumstances result in sales or administrative expenses mortality risks or other risks that are different from those normally associated with the policies these include the type of variations discussed under reduced charges for eligible classes no variation in any charge will exceed any maximum stated in this prospectus with respect to that charge any variation discussed above will be made only in accordance with uniform rules that we adopt and that we apply fairly to our customers procedures for issuance of a policy generally the policy is available with a minimum guaranteed death benefit at issue of  at the time of issue the insured person must have an attained age of  or less all insured persons must meet certain health and other insurance risk criteria called underwriting standards policies issued in montana or in connection with certain employee plans will not directly reflect the sex of the insured person in either the premium rates or the charges or values under the policy commencement of insurance coverage after you apply for a policy it can sometimes take up to several weeks for us to gather and evaluate all the information we need to decide whether to issue a policy to you and if so what the insured persons risk classification should be after we approve an application for a policy and assign an appropriate insurance rate class we will prepare the policy for delivery we will not pay a death benefit under a policy unless the policy is in effect when the insured person dies except for the circumstances described under temporary coverage prior to policy delivery below the policy will take effect only if all of the following conditions are satisfied        the policy is delivered to and received by the applicant        at least the first required premium is received by us        each insured person is living and still meets our criteria for issuing insurance if all of the above conditions are satisfied the policy will take effect on the date shown in the policy as the date of issue that is the date on which we begin to deduct monthly charges policy months policy years and policy anniversaries are all measured from the date of issue backdating in order to preserve a younger age at issue for the insured person we can designate a date of issue that is up to  days earlier than the date that would otherwise apply this is referred to as backdating and is allowed under state insurance laws    table of contents backdating can also be used in certain corporateowned life insurance cases involving multiple policies to retain a common monthly deduction date the conditions for coverage described above under commencement of insurance coverage must still be satisfied but in a backdating situation the policy always takes effect retroactively backdating results in a lower insurance charge if it is used to preserve the insured persons younger age at issue but monthly charges begin earlier than would otherwise be the case those monthly charges will be deducted as soon as we receive premiums sufficient to pay them temporary coverage prior to policy delivery if a specified amount of premium is paid with the application for a policy and other conditions are met we will provide temporary term life insurance coverage on the insured person for a period prior to the time coverage under the policy takes effect such temporary term coverage will be subject to the terms and

imposed on you tax consequences will vary based on your own particular circumstances and for further information you should consult a qualified tax adviser federal state and local tax laws regulations

gains of the separate account in our taxable income and take deductions for investment income credited to our policy holder reserves we are also required to capitalize and amortize certain costs instead of deducting those costs when    table of contents they are incurred we do not currently charge the separate account for any resulting income tax costs other than a dac tax charge we may impose against the separate account to compensate us for the finance costs attributable to the acceleration of our income tax liabilities by reason of a dac tax adjustment we also claim certain tax credits or deductions relating to foreign taxes paid and dividends received by the series funds these benefits can be material we do not pass these benefits through to the separate account principally because i the deductions and credits are allowed to us and not the policy owners under applicable tax law and ii the deductions and credits do not represent investment return on the separate account assets that are passed through to policy owners the policies permit us to deduct a charge for any taxes we incur that are attributable to the operation or existence of the policies or the separate account currently we do not anticipate making any specific charge for such taxes other than any dac tax charge and premium taxes if the level of the current taxes increases however or is expected to increase in the future we reserve the right to make a charge in the future death benefit proceeds and other policy distributions generally death benefits paid under policies such as yours are not subject to income tax earnings on your account value are ordinarily not subject to income tax as long as we dont pay them out to you if we do pay out any amount of your account value upon surrender or partial withdrawal all or part of that distribution would generally be treated as a return of the premiums youve paid and not subjected to income tax however certain distributions associated with a reduction in death benefit or other policy benefits within the first  years after issuance of the policy are ordinarily taxable in whole or in part amounts you borrow are generally not taxable to you however some of the tax rules change if your policy is found to be a modified endowment contract this can happen if youve paid premiums in excess of limits prescribed by the tax laws additional taxes and penalties may be payable for policy distributions of any kind including loans see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status below we expect the policy to receive the same federal income and estate tax treatment as fixed benefit life insurance policies section  of the internal revenue code defines a life insurance contract for federal tax purposes for a policy to be treated as a life insurance contract it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the guideline premium test these tests limit the amount of premium that you may pay into the policy we will monitor compliance with these standards if we determine that a policy does not satisfy section  we may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to bring it into compliance with section  if the policy complies with section  the death benefit proceeds under the policy ordinarily should be excludable from the beneficiarys gross income under section  of the internal revenue code increases in account value as a result of interest or investment experience will not be subject to federal income tax unless and until values are received through actual or deemed distributions in general unless the policy is a modified endowment contract the owner will be taxed on the amount of distributions that exceed the premiums paid under the policy an exception to this general rule occurs in the case of a decrease in the policys death benefit or any other change that reduces benefits under the policy in the first  years after the policy is issued and that results in a cash distribution to the policy owner changes that reduce benefits include partial withdrawals death benefit option changes and distributions required to keep the policy in compliance with section  for purposes of this rule any distribution within the two years immediately before a reduction in benefits will also be treated as if it caused the reduction a cash distribution that reduces policy benefits will be taxed in whole or in part to the extent of any gain in the policy under rules prescribed in section  the taxable amount is subject to limits prescribed in section f any taxable distribution will be ordinary income to the owner rather than capital gain distributions for tax purposes include amounts received upon surrender or partial withdrawals you may also be deemed to have received a distribution for tax purposes if you assign all or part of your policy rights or change your policys ownership it is possible that despite our monitoring a policy might fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under section  of the internal revenue code this could happen for example if we inadvertently failed to return to you any premium payments that were in excess of permitted amounts or if any of the funds failed to meet certain investment diversification or other requirements of the internal revenue code if this were to occur you would be subject to income tax on the income credited to the policy from the date of issue to the date of the disqualification and for subsequent periods tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds under federal state and local estate inheritance gift and other tax laws will depend on the circumstances of each owner or beneficiary if the person insured by the policy is also its    table of contents owner either directly or indirectly through an entity such as a revocable trust the death benefit will be includible in his or her estate for purposes of the federal estate tax if the owner is not the person insured the value of the policy will be includible in the owners estate upon his or her death even if ownership has been transferred the death proceeds or the policy value may be includible in the former owners estate if the transfer occurred less than three years before the former owners death or if the former owner retained certain kinds of control over the policy you should consult your tax adviser regarding these possible tax consequences because there may be unfavorable tax consequences including recognition of taxable income and the loss of income taxfree treatment for any death benefit payable to the beneficiary you should consult a qualified tax adviser prior to changing the policys ownership or making any assignment of ownership interests policy loans we expect that except as noted below see pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status loans received under the policy will be treated as indebtedness of an owner and that no part of any loan will constitute income to the owner however if the policy terminates for any reason other than the payment of the death benefit the amount of any outstanding loan that was not previously considered income will be treated as if it had been distributed to the owner upon such termination this could result in a considerable tax bill under certain circumstances involving large amounts of outstanding loans you might find yourself having to choose between high premiums required to keep your policy from lapsing and a significant tax burden if you allow the lapse to occur diversification rules and ownership of the account your policy will not qualify for the tax benefits of a life insurance contract unless the account follows certain rules requiring diversification of investments underlying the policy in addition the rules require that the policy owner not have investment control over the underlying assets in certain circumstances the owner of a variable life insurance policy may be considered the owner for federal income tax purposes of the assets of the separate account used to support the policy in those circumstances income and gains from the separate account assets would be includible in the policy owners gross income the internal revenue service irs has stated in published rulings that a variable policy owner will be considered the owner of separate account assets if the policy owner possesses incidents of ownership in those assets such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets a treasury decision issued in  stated that guidance would be issued in the form of regulations or rulings on the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts of a separate account without being treated as owners of the underlying assets as of the date of this prospectus no comprehensive guidance on this point has been issued in rev rul  however the irs ruled that a contract holder would not be treated as the owner of assets underlying a variable life insurance or annuity contract despite the owners ability to allocate funds among as many as twenty subaccounts the ownership rights under your policy are similar to but different in certain respects from those described in irs rulings in which it was determined that policyholders were not owners of separate account assets since you have greater flexibility in allocating premiums and policy values than was the case in those rulings it is possible that you would be treated as the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account we do not know what future treasury department regulations or other guidance may require we cannot guarantee that the funds will be able to operate as currently described in the series funds prospectuses or that a series fund will not have to change any funds investment objectives or policies we have reserved the right to modify your policy if we believe doing so will prevent you from being considered the owner of your policys proportionate share of the assets of the account but we are under no obligation to do so pay premium limit and modified endowment contract status at the time of policy issuance we will determine whether the planned premium schedule will exceed the pay limit discussed below if so our standard procedures prohibit issuance of the policy unless you sign a form acknowledging that fact the pay limit is the total of net level premiums that would have been payable at any time for a comparable fixed policy to be fully paidup after the payment of  equal annual premiums paidup means that no further premiums would be required to continue the coverage in force until maturity based on certain prescribed assumptions if the total premiums paid    table of contents at any time during the first  policy years exceed the pay limit the policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract which can have adverse tax consequences policies classified as modified endowment contracts are subject to the following tax rules        first all partial withdrawals from such a policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up to the amount equal to the excess if any of the policy value immediately before the distribution over the investment in the policy at such time if you own any other modified endowment contracts issued to you in the same calendar year by the same insurance company or its affiliates their values will be combined with the value of the policy from which you take the withdrawal for purposes of determining how much of the withdrawal is taxable as ordinary income        second loans taken from or secured by such a policy and assignments or pledges of any part of its value are treated as partial withdrawals from the policy and taxed accordingly pastdue loan interest that is added to the loan amount is treated as an additional loan        third a  additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution including distributions on surrender from or loan taken from or secured by such a policy that is included in income except where the distribution or loan        is made on or after the date on which the policy owner attains age              is attributable to the policy owner becoming disabled or        is part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the policy owner or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the policy owner and the policy owners beneficiary these exceptions to the  additional tax do not apply in situations where the policy is not owned by an individual furthermore any time there is a material change in a policy the policy will begin a new pay testing period as if it were a newlyissued policy the material change rules for determining whether a policy is a modified endowment contract are complex in general however the determination of whether a policy will be a modified endowment contract after a material change depends upon the relationship among the death benefit of the policy at the time of such change the policy value at the time of the change and the additional premiums paid into the policy during the seven years starting with the date on which the material change occurs moreover if there is a reduction in benefits under a policy such as a reduction in the death benefit or the reduction or cancellation of certain rider benefits during a pay testing period the pay limit will generally be recalculated based on the reduced benefits and the policy will be retested from the beginning of the pay testing period using the lower limit if the premiums paid to date at any point during the pay testing period are greater than the recalculated pay limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract if your policy is issued as a result of a section  exchange it may be considered to be a modified endowment contract if the death benefit under the new policy is smaller than the death benefit under the exchanged policy or if you reduce coverage in your new policy after it is issued therefore if you desire to reduce the face amount as part of a  exchange a qualified tax adviser should be consulted for advice all modified endowment contracts issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the same owner during any calendar year generally are required to be treated as one contract for the purpose of applying the modified endowment contract rules a policy received in exchange for a modified endowment contract will itself also be a modified endowment contract you should consult your tax adviser if you have questions regarding the possible impact of the pay limit on your policy corporate and hr  retirement plans the policy may be acquired
