position after that we will open the call for questions we had a solid start to  with our first quarter net investment income increasing  yearoveryear to  million or  per share and our adjusted net investment income which we defined as net investment income excluding any capital gains incentive fee attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses rising  to  million or  per share overall we continue to execute well as reflected in the performance of our portfolio of investments the stability and capital preservation of the portfolio and capital gains opportunities from equity investments as of march   our net asset value was  million or  per share up slightly from our  yearend figures on march   fidus paid a regular quarterly dividend of  per share at march  estimated spillover income or taxable income in excess of distributions was  million or  per share for the second quarter of  the board of directors has declared a regular quarterly dividend of  per share which is payable on june   to stockholders of record on june   in the first quarter of  we invested  million in debt and equity securities of this amount  million was channeled to three new portfolio company investments in each case these businesses adhered to our investment strategy of focusing on companies that have positive long terms outlooks strong yet defensible market positions operate in industries we know well and that generate excess free cash flow for debt service and growth let me briefly recap each of our new portfolio company investments we invested  million in subordinated notes in common equity of new era technology inc a provider of end to end it solutions primarily to the state and local government education and healthcare markets  million in subordinated notes in common equity of revenue management solutions llc a leading provider of services that match reconcile and facilitate the posting of healthcare payments received against submitted claims for healthcare providers benefit managers and billing companies and  million in subordinated notes in common equity of transgo llc a specialty manufacturer and designer of aftermarket automotive transmission parts and repair kits in addition we invested  million capital in existing portfolio companies including  million in new subordinated notes of worldwide express helping finance a recapitalization of the company and an ownership transition  million in a new subordinated note of caldwell  gregory and  million in an addon to our subordinated notes and accent food services from a repayments and realizations perspective we also had an active first quarter proceeds totaled  million including we received payment in full on our worldwide express subordinated notes and sold a portion of our equity for a realized gain net of estimated taxes of approximately  million concurrently we rolled over  million of our equity investments into a new equity investment in this portfolio company we received payment in full on our debt investment in grindmaster corporation and we also received payment in full on our debt investments in caldwell  gregory llc as reported in our first quarter press release we had one subsequent event occur following the quarters end on april   we sold our equity investment in anatrace products llc for a realized gain of  million the fair market value of our investment portfolio at march   was approximately  million equal to  of cost we ended the quarter with debt and equity investments in  active portfolio companies the breakdown on a fair value basis between debt and equity remained fairly stable with  in debt and  in equity investments providing us with high levels of current and recurring income from our debt investments and the continued opportunity to realize capital gains from our equity related investments in terms of portfolio performance we tracked several quality measures on a quarterly basis to help us monitor the overall stability quality and performance of our investment portfolios in the first quarter these metrics remained strong and in line with prior periods first we tracked the portfolios weighted average investment rating based on our internal systems under our methodology a rating of one is outperformed and a rating of five is an expected loss as of march  the weighted average investment rating for the portfolio is  on a fair value basis in line with prior periods another metric we track is the credit performance of the portfolio which is measured by our portfolio companys combined ratio of total net debt through fidus debt investments to total ebitda for the first quarter this ratio was  times compared to  times for the same quarter last year the third measure we track is the combined ratio of our portfolio companys total ebitda to total cash interest expense which is indicative of the cushion our portfolio of companies have in aggregate to meet their debt service obligations to us in the first quarter this metric was  times compared to  times for the same quarter last year the soundness of these metrics reflect our philosophy of maintaining significant cushions to our borrowers enterprise value in and support of our capital preservation and income goals in q we placed one of our investments restaurant finance company llc on nonaccrual status which represented  of the total portfolio at cost and  of the portfolio on a fair value basis given a tough restaurant climate we remain in active discussion with the company on our path forward turning to our outlook market dynamics thus far in  are painting a relatively stable picture for us the overall economy continues to grow at a slow but steady rate ma activity particularly in our target lower middle market remains at a reasonably healthy level competition in the private debt and equity markets remained strong against this backdrop we continue to be highly selective maintaining a cautious and deliberate approach to investing that emphasizes quality over quantity of course this selectivity means that we will experience quartertoquarter fluctuations in our investment activity levels in any event we will rely as we always have on our core strengths including our relationships our industry knowledge and our ability to offer flexible capital solutions we have sufficient liquidity to continue to invest in businesses that we believe will perform well over the long term ones that can generate attractive risk adjusted returns and preserve capital by adhering to our proven investment strategy to grow and further diversify our investment portfolio we believe we remain well positioned relative to our goal of delivering a stable to growing dividend over the long term now i’ll turn the call over to shelby to provide some details on our financial and operating results shelby shelby sherard thank you ed and good morning everyone ill review our first quarter results in more detail and close with comments on our liquidity position please note i will be providing comparative commentary versus the prior quarter q  total investment income was  million for the three months ended march   a  million decrease from q  interest income increased  million primarily related to more assets under management which was offset by a  million decrease in fee income due to fewer investments in q dividend income in q was  million versus  million in q a decrease of  million primarily related to higher than usual distributions received in q from equity investments in nine portfolio companies including a  million in distributions of earnings and profits related to dividend recaps for two of our equity investments the wolf organization and world wide packaging total expenses including income tax provision were  million for the first quarter approximately  million lower than the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease in accrued capital gains incentive fees in q and excise taxes accrued in q interest expense decreased by  million related to the repayment of  million of sba debentures ga expenses increase by  million base management and income incentive fees decreased by a total of roughly  million and a crude capital gains incentive fees decreased by  million interest expense includes the interest paid on fiduss sba debentures and line of credit as well as any commitment and unused line fees as of march   the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt was  versus  in q as of march  we had  million of debt outstanding the sba debentures maturing in march  that were repaid at the end of february had an interest rate of  higher than our weighted average cost of debt net investment income or nii for the three months ended march  were  million or  per share versus  per share in q  adjusted nii was  per share in q versus  per share in q adjusted nii is defined as net investment income excluding any capital gains incentive fees expense or reversal attributable to realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments a reconciliation of nii to adjusted nii can be found in our earnings press release that was issued yesterday afternoon and is also posted on the investor relations page of our website for the three months ended march   fidus had  million of net realized gains primarily related to the partial sale of our equity investment in worldwide express operations this was partially offset by a related accrued tax expense of  million our net asset value at march   was  per share which reflects payment of the  per share regular dividend in march turning now to portfolio statistics as of march  our total investment portfolio had a fair value of  million consistent with our debt oriented investment strategy our portfolio on a cost basis was comprised approximately of  subordinated debt  senior secured loans and  equity securities our average portfolio company investment on a cost basis was  million at the end of the first quarter we have equity investments in approximately  of our portfolio companies with an absolutely diluted equity ownership of  weighted average effective yield on debt investments was  as of march  the weighted average yield is computed using the effective interest rates for debt investment at costs including the accretion of original issue discounts and loan origination fees but excluding investments on nonaccrual if any now id like to briefly discuss our available liquidity as of march  our liquidity in capital resources included cash and cash equivalents of  million unfunded sba commitments of  million and  million of availability on our line of credit resulting in total liquidity of a  million additionally in q we requested sba approval for the remaining  million of sba debentures for fidus mezzanine capital ii which is not reflected in our total liquidity as of march  now i will turn the call back to ed for concluding comments ed edward ross thanks shelby i would like to thank our team and the board of directors at fidus for their dedication and hard work and our shareholders for their continued support i will now turn the call over to candice for qa candice questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from robert dodd of raymond james your line is now open robert dodd hi guys just you made multiple references to the potential for equity gains and i wonder if that sends a signal about the activity in the markets i mean obviously unrealized appreciation on the equity of one something like  million bucks so theres quite a lot there potentially do you think that were likely to see those materialize at somewhat higher rate and then isnt that when those realization event type of events occur would you say thats correlated with higher prepayments and we could see potential overall gains but then declines in overall portfolio as prepayment activity picks up edward ross sure its a great question robert i wish i had a crystal ball that i think just to address the questions overall its i think a healthy ma market and as you know we have equity investments in a large large percentage of our portfolio companies and so i do think its going to continue to be what i would say healthy im not going to use the word robust but healthy m a market and thats where were working hard on the origination side to participate in that but to your point we also think there will be some realizations on both the debt side as well as on the equity side through the year do i think its going to be the abnormal level i dont think so but i do think most of the deals both on the or most of our originations and most of our repayments today are being driven by ma activity so we are hopeful that we will see some gains this year or some incremental gains this year obviously weve had some thus far as well so with regard to prepayments some of these companies quite frankly have been in the portfolio for a while and dont want to have prepayment fees and then there are others that will have some so i think thats going to be a mix and so i dont have an average or a normal number there i do think theyll be some but i dont think thats going to be abnormal either hopefully that helped robert dodd thank you yes that’s helpful i got one more on the attachment point in the cash interest coverage and we see cash interest coverage  stable yearoveryear but the attachment point up to  versus  so obviously can you give us some color on the drivers of that i mean obviously you have coupon compression youd expect cash interest coverage to go up less than the attachment point but is that the driver or is it some other effect that’s leading to the disparity in changes between those two credit metrics edward ross yes i think the i do think the attachment point maybe is a little higher on the senior lending which lowers the rates so i think that probably matters a little bit and then i do think yields or there has been some compression over time relative to a year ago i think to the leverage point i think what i would say there our portfolio is leveraged higher than it was a year ago some of that has to do  i think the portfolio is probably on the newer side if you well this with regard to the originations over the last  months or  months and then also part of that especially over the last nine months and through some efforts or efforts on our part i would say the average deal is a little bit larger deal a little bit larger company and with that becomes usually higher purchase price multiples and higher leverage and so that is also phenomenon its really just more mix than anything else just bigger companies and with that comes a little higher leverage so thats probably the primary driver on the leverage side robert dodd got it thank you edward ross yes absolutely good talking to you robert operator thank you and our next question comes from bryce rowe of baird your line is now open bryce rowe thanks good morning guys edward ross good morning bryce shelby sherard good morning bryce bryce rowe i wanted to ask a couple questions ed i was kind of pleasantly surprised to see that you had net positive originations for the quarter i think last quarters call you talked about that possibility not being positive so that was good to see so curious whats your thinking just generally for the next couple quarters in terms of net flows into the investment portfolio if you got a good enough crystal ball and then number two for shelby just curious from a liquidity or cash perspective where do you work those cash balances down to or where are you comfortable working this down to before you use the credit facility or draw more sba debentures thanks edward ross okay thanks bryce obviously both very good questions i think ill kick this off in terms of the market and i touched on this in the prepared remarks i think the market as we see it at least in the lower middle market is pretty healthy so deal flow is good and we are seeing i would say ample high quality situations in pursuing those interestingly we did have a couple deals in the last  days where we were awarded them but they fell apart just the diligence wasnt panning out on our end so we let those deals go but having said that were still very busy right now on the new investment front and so we are hopeful to have an active next four or five months is what i would say so if i think about originations i hope i think this will be a slower quarter than last quarter and for sure and i think on the repayment side it will also be slower so were hopeful for some modest portfolio growth this quarter but that is very hard to predict both on the originations and on the repayment side so i go back to activity levels and they are very healthy were continuing to see a steady stream of flow some of its good some of it is bad but theres clearly enough to pursue so i think that part of it is very healthy hopefully that answers the first question and ill pass it off to shelby shelby sherard so on an liquidity side bryce i like to aggressively manage cash as much as possible to minimize interest expense but unfortunately i do have to be mindful of whats the kind of near term net income activity and where do we have cash meaning is it a holding company or is that at the sbics what i would tell you today is i would call it  about  million of that really is at the holding company so i should be able to work that down especially with the payment of the q dividend and then we typically have a preference of utilizing the sba program so if we have investment opportunities that fit the sbic criteria we would look to invest those in fmc too first so it may mean some borrowing against the sba fund and then just using cash as we need to at the holding company so hopefully that kind of gives you a little bit insight the only other thing i would add just to be mindful of particularly as to kind of get to the end of q we do need to be mindful of our fmc debt maturity and so were still pretty far out in front of maturing debt but you will see us from timetotime start to accumulate cash from repayments and anticipation of paying down debt bryce rowe great thats super helpful thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from chris kotowski of oppenheimer your line is now open chris kotowski good morning just with the new nonaccrual loan i wonder if you could characterize it is there a sector issue or is it idiosyncratic or is it in some way tied to some whatever regional economic weakness and in the market space served edward ross sure great question chris and the answer is its a little bit of everything i think all restaurants have been impacted a little bit by just the competition if you will in the restaurant sector but this company last fall had to weather a hurricane they had to weather some bathroom bill in north carolina that has recently been overturned but it greatly reduced convention activity in charlotte in particular and then they also had riots in charlotte so theres a variety of things that has impacted if you will the charlotte restaurant world and we were one of them so and we have restaurants in other places as well but that was one of the drivers for sure so were currently working with the company on a mutually agreeable path forward and what i would say is the valuation reflects the increased level of risk on our investments chris kotowski okay and then i mean i guess youve touched on it by saying that your activity levels are very high but i guess i would say the common theme of the bdc earnings season thus far has been that its been difficult to keep assets on the books and that there are heavy prepayments and i mean that  i think thats been the recurring theme of most of the earnings call ive listened to and but you seem to be immune from that and is that just that you play in a different segment of the market or any theory on why that’s seems different edward ross yes i think the broader market is very different chris and then people are looking to refinance and get lower rates wherever possible that does happen in our segment for sure but its i think its a lot less at the end of the day and so were not immune to it what i would say and its back to the comment i made earlier is i think most of the activity really for a pretty good period of time now for us has been ma driven activity so on the origination front it is typically some kind of ma event and then also on the repayments and realisation side thats what were seeing but we do expect to have healthy level of repayments this year but theyre going to be mostly at least thats our expectation ma driven events im sure theyll be a couple surprises here or there but thats what weve seen thus far so i think theres a little bit of were in a different market and maybe just a little lucky as well but thats what we expect going forward further chris kotowski okay all right thats it from me thank you edward ross okay great good to talking you chris operator thank you and our next question comes from arren cyganovich of da davidson your line is now open arren cyganovich thank you with the portfolio yield it declined just modestly  basis points quartertoquarter is there a trend there that youre seeing within the your book of potential pipeline of opportunities that youll expect further compression or is this some are going to be stable from this point edward ross sure great question arren and good morning i think the decline that took place this quarter is really due to primarily to two things one is worldwide the new investment there is call it  basis points lower than where we were before and so thats one piece of it and the other one is quite frankly the restaurant finance which is a higher yielding investment going on nonaccruals so those are the two primary drivers as i look forward and i think about even the last quarter the yields on originations were in line with the yields on week payments so i think theres going to be pretty good stability here we clearly still have some older vintage investments that if when theyre repay they could cause a little bit of a down draft but i dont see a material change in our yields as i go forward at least as we sit here today so hopefully that’s helpful but were not projecting big change in yields from our perspective arren cyganovich great thanks and then in terms of the portfolio quality it sounds like other than the one to nonaccrual sounds fairly stable are there any industries that youre watching a little bit more closely these days for pockets of weakness or its mostly just fairly stable as you can see here from the portfolio company level edward ross sure great question i think overall what were seeing and ill just comment on the portfolio for a second is stability and slow growth somewhat across the board when i think about sectors to worry about energy is one to think long and hard about but the good news there is we are seeing a pretty good increase in operating activity levels in the field if you will and so thats been a positive from our perspective but its still at levels that would give you concern making a new investment but thats a positive i think on the consumer side i think restaurants obviously there has been there is a fair bit of competition out there at the end of the day and so thats one to pay attention to and then ecommerce with regard to retail need to be you know paying attention to the impact that ecommerce did have on a confidence and so those are two areas that were paying attention to and then the last one is health care healthcare services is an area where you can take reimbursement rate risk and thats one where we have and weve done fine but i would tell you were not looking to add to our portfolio with investments where theres you know significant reimbursement rate risk so thats how were were seeing it right now q  arren cyganovich very helpful thank you edward ross yep good talking to you arren operator thank you and our next question comes from ryan lynch of kbw your line is now open ryan lynch good morning first question following up on the conversation with robert about the realizations and you mentioned potentially having some realizations in the portfolio later this year which being very positive some of that being from some equity investors potentially just wondering given the increase in valuations in the market and maybe even potential lofty valuations in the market that were seen today does it ever make sense to pull back on making these equity coinvestments on some of your  on your subordinated debt when you guys appointed capital it looked like you guys make equity coinvestments in all three of your new investments and thats always been part of your strategy but im just wondering if theres a point in time where evaluations in the market get high enough where you don’t think there is going to be much outsiders equity coinvestments and you pull back on that strategy at all a  edward ross great question ryan ryan i think when we make an equity investment we are each time were looking at the debt investment and do we like that and then do we like the equity investment i think your point is well taken we are in a market where the overall purchase price multiples in the ma world are very high but it does vary and the opportunity varies on an individual asset basis and so thats how we look at it probably we are paying attention to whats going on in the market but were also just looking at the overall quality of the company and the quality of the investment and i think that the company and where weve been investing right now we feel very good about the long term outlooks of the businesses where were making equity investments so point is well taken it is the time to be selling if youre investment is right enough to do so but at the same time there are plenty of opportunities out there from our perspective to invest in very high quality businesses and that can generate an attractive risk adjusted returns and so were each time we make a debt or equity investment thats how we’re thinking about it and but were seeing good opportunities on the equity side as well but you know some  they are higher prices than they were  years ago but theyre still attractive at least from our perspective at this point ryan lynch okay and then i think in response of bryce’s question you mentioned as far as capital deployment goes you mentioned that a few deals actually fell apart later in the investment process cycle so i just wondering if can give any sort of high level color on why those deals fell apart was it more something changed in the terms of the documentation or the strategy that you made the choice to pull back and not go follow through with those deals or listen more that the borrowers chose to go to somebody else in the market maybe a different competitor that maybe was coming in with better pricing edward ross sure no great questions in both cases we pulled back one was due to a background check of an individual and the other one was new information that kind of came across the transom regarding potential concerns on the projections that we were given or at least it impacted and created concerns regarding the outlook of the business and so in both cases we were the ones that pulled away there ryan lynch okay thank you those are all the questions from me edward ross okay great good talking to you operator thank you and i’m showing no further questions at this time i’d like to turn the conference back over to mr ed ross for any closing remarks edward ross thank you candice and
