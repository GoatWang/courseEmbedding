address baker hughes  essex lane suite  houston texas  httpwwwbakerhughescom ■ michael e wiley spent his entire career in the oil and gas industry and industry analysts regarded him as one of the top two or three executives in the entire field because of his highly successful year career with the atlantic richfield company arco wiley was chosen to head up the worlds thirdlargest oil and gas company baker hughes incorporated bhi at a time when the company was experiencing a serious slump in profits after turning the ailing company around he announced in  that he would retire in april  responding to the announcement lead bhi director h john riley said the entire board is extremely appreciative of mike wileys outstanding leadership and his significant contributions to the success of baker hughes press release april   early career upon graduating from high school in  wiley entered the university of tulsa as a student in the newly created petroleum engineering undergraduate scholarship program on a scholarship from arco his summers were spent working for arco one of the nations largest oil companies and he began fulltime employment there after graduating in  after serving in numerous engineering capacities in production operation drilling planning and research and development in alaska the continental united states and internationally in  he became vice president and began his rise in senior management when arco created vastar resources in —a  percent domestic exploration and production company with a presence in some of the most attractive oil and gas basins in the united states—wiley became its first president the following year he became its chairman and ceo as well houstonbased vastar was  percent owned by arco and wileys direction made the fledgling company a leader in domestic exploration production and marketing and substantially strengthened arcos presence in the gulf of mexico in an interview with leslie haines of oil  gas investor  wiley commented the thing that really differentiates vastar is that it has a very focused but broadbased exploration program that is significant compared to most of its peers january  wiley added that the cornerstones of his strategy were first to be a lowcost fullcycle company in all respects from exploration to marketing he said vastars cashcost structure was as good as any in its peer group and at startup their expenses were even lower than they had expected second focused and disciplined exploration coupled with aggressive exploitation would drive internal growth apart from  percent seed money slated for expansion into new areas and technologies  percent of their efforts would be concentrated on their regional focus areas—the rich fields in the gulf of mexico the gulf coast the san juan basin in new mexico and the midcontinent region extending from the texas panhandle into michigan his third strategy was valueadded marketing they were already a top producermarketer in the united states marketing nationally and selling more than two billion cubic feet daily his fourth strategy was to keep the company financially strong and flexible this would be achieved he said by keeping the balance sheet solid and by funding operations with internally generated cash focus and expertise leads to the top in  arco was the seventhlargest oil company in the united states and employed  people globally on september  of that year following an internal memo announcing planned budget cuts and layoffs to offset decreased oil prices globally and increased competition from larger companies arco undertook a major management shakeup two top executives including president william wade retired suddenly wiley was chosen to replace wade and fill a newly created position as coo arco chairman mike bowlin commented that the changes would help the company execute its core strategies one of which was to focus on businesses in which they could maintain a leadership position in the industry in may

four consecutive years wicklund felt that while bhi still had issues they were now being addressed far more effectively and directly than many analysts had previously anticipated meanwhile according to pike an analyst for a g edwards  sons said that the weakness in stock price created a good opportunity to by a company that has become the purest play in the oilfieldservice business and is finally on the right track may  just nine months after wiley joined bhi the companys debt of  billion in  had been reduced and the target for the end of  was set at  billion that target was attained when asked by pike how his management style affected bhis turnaround wiley responded i do not believe there is any one formula or methodology for management and leadership i think each industry each business has its own set of issues and opportunities you have to be flexible… the key is to build a culture of performance that creates value over a long period of time he also said he felt sure the industry had not seen the end of fluctuating economic cycles and that those inevitable cycles needed to be managed in a manner that attracts maintains and motivates the workforce that is a big one he
