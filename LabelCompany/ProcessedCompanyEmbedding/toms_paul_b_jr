to get out of finished goods inventory but we also probably need to build our other inventories a little bit so i dont think there is  million net that we will take on inventories i think our inventory levels actually are approaching the point that we think they need to be to properly service the business and so we are actually over the summer will be in a mode of building inventories back to handle what typically you know is our strongest selling season starting right around labor day this excerpt taken from the hoft k filed feb  a  paul toms well weve never been in the business of forecasting profitability and i think if you were to look back historically at the company that was the norm  operating income was something that we achieved several years and was typically a goal and i think if you looked at the fourth quarter  prior to restructuring charges we were  operating income and we do feel like going forward that we have taken a tremendous amount of cost out of the company with termination of the esop and closing of the margins were planned and just also grow like  a significant part of our warehousing and distributing costs are nonrecurring and that the part related to the inventory build through the third end of the fourth quarter but some of those offsite storage costs demurrage and related warehousing and distributing costs should not recur going forward q  todd schwartzman and if thats the case with your transition now almost complete in your shift in business model you dont see any reason for you know not to return to those historical
