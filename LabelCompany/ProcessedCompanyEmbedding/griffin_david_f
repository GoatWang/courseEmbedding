ozone  a sterilized product produced by the method of claim  description technical fieldthe present invention relates to the sterilization of small articles for example surgical devices and supplies such articles include surgical staples and sutures background the need for thorough sterilization of surgical implements and supplies is of course well known and painstaking and expensive steps are often taken to ensure the highest levels of sterility for medical supplies and equipment by way of example of a well developed field of prior art is a series of patents to glick including us pat nos   and  which relate to the particular problems encountered in sterilizing absorbable sutures without degrading them and especially in sterilizing sutures and other medical devices made of polyglycolic acid us pat no  to armstrong discloses a liquidphase process for sterilization of surgical or medical instruments using ozonized oxygen the liquid phase typically aqueous is pretreated under pressure with turbulence to achieve maximum uniformity of oxygenozone concentration throughout the fluid such a liquid phase sterilization process is not appropriate for small medical devices including absorbable sutures staples and the like which can be sensitive to moisture and are subject to decomposition or degradation as reported by armstrong ozone is contraindicated as a gasphase sterilant for medical equipment and supplies because of the difficulty in controlling the concentration and the consistent effectiveness of ozone col  lines  summary of the invention this invention solves a problem in particular it solves the problem of providing an improved method of sterilization which is reliable safe and nondestructive for metallic surgical elements and even for sensitive polymeric and biological materials while at the same time being noncontaminating and nonpolluting still more particularly the invention provides such a method which is suitable for sterilization of supplies or devices in packages that are sealed after sterilization while glick discloses such a package in the form of a multilayer envelope including a laminated sheath in which aluminum foil is sandwiched between polyethylene layers and the envelope is further sealed within a paper pouch glick uses ethyleneoxide sterilization i have discovered that although widely practiced ethylene oxide sterilization methods can suffer from the drawback of residual contamination of the package or the sterilized contents by the ethylene oxide or by gaseous contaminants associated with ethylene oxide gas technology or by reaction products of these gases with the package material or contents another possible route of contamination or retention of ethylene oxide in the package for subsequent release is by absorption by or coating of the polymeric liner for example polyethylene which is usually used to provide a heatsealable envelope ethylene oxide is an extremely noxious explosive material gaseous at warmer room temperatures but liquid at cooler room temperatures below ° c ° f it is probably carcinogenic and is highly irritating to eyes and mucous membranes it has also been linked to pulmonary edema substantial residues from ethylene oxide treatment can clearly pose a hazard to workers exposed to them and may constitute an environmental hazard from significant quantities of contaminated packaging because of its unpleasant characteristics ethylene oxide treatments are complex and expensive employing for example polyhalogenated alkane gases such as freon dupont as diluents to nugate its explosivity such gases are expensive and require careful confinement to avoid deleterious environmental consequences accordingly the present invention provides a method of sterilizing supplies and devices of a size that can readily be handled manually especially medical supplies and devices which method comprises treating such supplies and devices in an enclosed environment with an ozone atmosphere in which ozone is present at a sufficient concentration to be an effective sterilant the method is preferably conducted under moderate conditions of temperature pressure and time to provide effective sterilization without degrading sensitive medical materials such as catgut or polyglycol clearly stainless steel surgical elements such as surgical staples can withstand more rigorous conditions detailed description of the preferred embodiments the duration of the ozone treatment should be quite short for nonmetallic products because of the efficacy of ozone whereas an hour may produce particularly thorough sterilization of stainless steel products less than ten minutes and preferably from  to  minutes is adequate for destructible materials such as polyglycol and catgut excessive ozone exposure can degrade sensitive materials moderate temperatures not exceeding ° f are desirable while roomtemperature treatments of from ° to ° f are preferred pressures below one atmosphere gauge are effective with from five to ten psig being preferred the particular reaction conditions chosen will depend upon the concentration of ozone since high concentrations of ozone are expensive and could be unduly reactive diluted ozone is preferred the ozone concentration is preferably less than  percent and more preferably  percent or under with from about  to about  percent by volume being practical the balance being an inactive diluent which can include oxygen polyhalogenated alkanes such as fluon used by the prior art as diluents for ethylene oxide are not needed for ozone suitable diluents include air and other oxygencontaining gaseous mixtures though care must be taken to avoid oxidation of the package liner or contents preferred diluent gases include inactive or inert gases or gaseous mixtures such as nitrogen or deoxygenated air carbon dioxide and argon an ozonerich atmosphere for use in the process of the invention can be provided in situ by electrical discharge treatment of air to provide a concentration of from  to  ozone preferably from  to  percent it is desirable to control and monitor the ozone concentration so that its limits of variation are known and stabilized for effective management of the sterilization process furthermore accurate control of the sterilization conditions with verification of efficacy permits its optimization to avoid degradation of the sterilized product while obtaining acceptable levels of or acceptable confidence levels of sterilization these considerations are of course important for the sensitive materials mentioned above notably catgut and polyglycolic acids such materials are well known to the art as are their embodiments in orthopedic and surgical devices and in sutures staples dressings swabs and bandages as is disclosed in some detail in the glick patents cited above the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference thereto because of the sensitivity of polyglycolic acids to moisture the treatment process of this invention is effected under dry conditions when employed for sterilizing such materials the use of an ozone atmosphere in the manner of this invention is particularly well suited to such a dry process the invention can be carried out using a package for the sterilized contents which is substantially as disclosed in the glick patents such a package comprises an envelope of multilayer material which material is a sandwich of aluminum foil between heatsealable polymeric inner and outer liners the polymer as mentioned above can be polyethylene and is sealed into an open pouch the pouch is filled with items or materials which are sterilized in a first sterilization step in the open pouch by maintaining the contents and the pouch in an ozonerich atmosphere of particular concentration for a period of time sufficient to kill any undesirable organisms on the pouch and its contents the pouch is then heatsealed across its opening while still in a sterile atmosphere the foil filling to the laminate package wall provides a moisture barrier this inner sealed sterilized package is further sealed inside a strippable paper outer package or wrapper which may contain printed information about the contents and which may be subjected to a second sterilization step the present invention extends to a packaging and sterilization method which is of the type disclosed in the glick patents with the difference that an ozonerich atmosphere as described above is used in place of the ethylenedioxidecontaining gas or gaseous mixture disclosed by glick and reaction conditions as described herein are used for the ozone treatment thus the second sterilization step can also be carried out in an ozonepermeable sealed outer package which is not permeable to bacteria viral fungal or other bioactive contaminants or alternatively is sterilized and supplied with a sterile ozone mixture when the outer package is placed in an atmosphere of ozone ozone permeates the same sterilizing the outer package and the inner bag inside it the sterilization may be carried out by placing the sealed outer package with the sealed inner package inside it in a container in a chamber having an ozonerich atmosphere then transferring the package to a second chamber where the ozone would be removed if desired the loaded package can be evacuated before or after sterilization or both also the sterilized package can be flushed out with a sterile inert gas for example nitrogen or air after sterilization and such a gas may be sealed in the package for moisturesensitive materials or products one or more desiccation steps can be included to arrest any undesired oxidative effects of ozone the package can be treated with a reducing agent for example a hydrogencontaining gas preferably in a dry gaseous stream to remove any reaction product water vapor after sterilization a suitable gas is a dry sterilized stream of nitrogen containing a small proportion of hydrogen by volume for example  percent or less preferably from  to  percent alternatively a small quantity of a dry preferably hygroscopic sterile reducing agent can be included in the package for example as a thin layer of slowly oxidizable material in a multilayer package material oxidation of the material should not occur so quickly as to outpace sterilization any such included reducing agent should however preferably be biologically innoccuous and absorbable or well secured to the package in view of the risk of displacement into a surgical opening in a patient example three thirtysix inch lengths of polyglycolic acid braided sutures each having a halfcircle taper point needle and being wrapped or mounted on separate paper spools are packaged in a laminar polyethylenefoil envelope as described above and sterilized by a method including the following steps after forming a foursided envelope and charging it with the sutures the loaded envelope is placed in a gas permeable container which is not permeable to bacteria and other biological agents and this container is placed in an ozone sterilizing chamber the oven is first evacuated and then is charged with a  by volume ozoneenriched air at about ° f and approximately  psig for three minutes with suitable gasflow agitation to freshen the ozonerich atmosphere contacting the sutures the package is flushed with sterilized nitrogen containing a small proportion of hydrogen such as five percent and the package is evacuated and sealed in the manner described above the product of the method of the example is a sterilized package of sutures free of any ethylene oxide residue or contamination which presents no hazards in handling or disposal the invention of course extends to the treatment of a plurality of loaded packages in a batch or continuous process manner the invention further extends to sterilized products produced by the inventive sterilization methods disclosed herein while an illustrative embodiment of the invention has been described above it is of course understood that various modifications will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art such modifications are within the spirit and scope of the invention which is limited and defined only by the appended claims  previous patent package and method f      next patent vertical type formin  home search services communities

world and work of david griffin  company realtors founded in  the company is known for the distinctive and innovative way it approaches the dallas residential real estate market and for the outstanding results it achieves for its clientscompany founder and president david griffin says “as a native dallasite i am always on the search to explore and know everything that is best and most stimulating about the city what are the best neighborhoods where are the coolest midcentury houses which shops and restaurants are currently the best experiences “i grew up in what many consider to be one of the best neighborhoods dallas has to offer university park i attended all  grades in the highland park independent school district i studied english literature and hold a ba from southern methodist university i did graduate work at the university of texas in dallas “when i was a kid downtown dallas was a vibrant place by the time i was a young teenager i was taking the bus downtown to go to the movies bookstores library and the record stores — my particular interests i grew to love the bustle of downtown all the things i loved the most were on a route i could walk on a saturday i also grew to appreciate the languor of the long dallas summer taking care of the yard and the hominess of our s tudor that my parents had bought and remodeled in  but the city and all that is urban was if i am honest with myself today what resonated most with me “i think i must have always loved looking at real estate maybe that is because my mother spent so long when i was very young househunting i still remember a half a century later some of the houses we saw and what made an impression on me i particularly liked buttons in the dining room floor where you could buzz the kitchen air conditioning units also held a fascination for me some were built into furniture and took up the whole end of a room — very fancy “after all these and many more childhood experiences and school and college and parttime jobs i found myself courtesy of an aunt who loved to travel able to go to europe and backpack my way across spain italy germany switzerland austria france holland and great britain almost every day on the fourmonth journey i thought about what to do next with my life do i go back to school and try and put my love of literature to some kind of remunerative use or do i go into business and what kind of career could i pursue with the education i had the more i traveled the more it dawned on me that what i probably enjoyed the most was getting to know people i was meeting so many fellow student travelers and after having gone to  years of school with basically the same kids it was very expanding to meet and trade experiences with people from all over the world a plan began to form in my mind that if i pursued real estate and i thought from the very beginning residential real estate that it would afford me the opportunities to meet all kinds of new people and yet remain near my family in my hometown “i started by selling homes in the park cities my first two sales were in highland park — one on armstrong and one on westway with that i was quickly on my way the business was a very good fit for me i loved houses and i loved courting people for their business i was very green when i did not know an answer which was often my natural response was to turn red by  my third year in the business i was the number one agent in the henry s miller office in highland park village by  i was ready at the age of  to jump out on my own dallas was booming and the sky was the limit david griffin  company did amazingly well its first few years growing to a company of about  agents however the economy crashed in  and a few years later i remember questioning how i had ever gotten into such a godforsaken business “things did slowly get better in the late s and we began branching out into the lakewood and oak lawn neighborhoods at one time or another i made each of these areas my home as i fell in love with white rock lake and the marvelous spanish influenced homes in lakewood and then with the modern oglesbydesigned townhomes in oak lawn by the mid s after a decade or so of very slow growth in the marketplace we started working with developers who saw the opportunity to redevelop the oak lawnturtle creek neighborhood or uptown as it would later be named intown dallas was beginning to change and we were all over it representing buyers and sellers on all kinds of new townhome and condominium product our company beginning in the mid s started to see its production level and agent sponsorship begin to grow by leaps and bounds “from  to  we have seen the sales volume of the business increase  the company has grown its business in a number of strategic ways it has been the goto company for developers on ‘in fill’ townhome and condominium product in oak lawn uptown turtle creek old east dallas and now in the arts district downtown north oak cliff and victory park whether it’s the arts districts one arts plaza victorys the house southsides the beat the cedars buzz kesslers kessler woods or east dallass thirty thirty bryan to name a few of the most innovative david griffin  company has handled the marketing and brokerage “the company has continued to market new and to resell singlefamily homes in dallass coolest and most soughtafter intown neighborhoods our distinctive and awardwinning signs with their black and teal color scheme pepper these neighborhoods our clients know that when they are looking to buy or sell in these neighborhoods the most distinctive options are often in the david griffin  company inventory we understand design and are the first choice realtor when aesthetics and superb and caring service are important to a

formation in physiologic systems authors charles f babbs purdue universityfollow david w griffin abstract a major impediment to the confirmation of free radical mechanisms in pathogenesis is a lack of direct chemical evidence that oxygen centered free radicals actually arise in living tissues in quantities sufficient to cause serious damage this investigation was conducted to validate the use of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as a quantitative molecular probe for the generation of hydroxyl radicals ho under physiologic conditions reaction of ho with dmso produces methane sulfinic acid msa as a primary product which can be detected by a simple colorimetric assay to develop a method for estimating total ho production we studied two model systems the superoxide driven fenton reaction in vitro using xanthine oxidase as the source of superoxide and a computer model of fenton chemistry measured msa production both in vitro and in the computer model was a predictable function of the concentrations of dmso and competing scavengers of ho according to the principle of competition kinetics both experimental results and model calculations showed that scatchard analysis may be used to infer total ho generation despite the presence of scavengers other than dmso such as mannitol thus methane sulfinic acid production from dmso holds promise as an easily measured marker for ho formation in biologic systems pretreated with dmso and scatchard analysis of repeated experiments with varying dmso concentrations can yield an estimate of total ho generation comments this is the

purdue universityfollow david w griffin abstract a major impediment to the confirmation of free radical mechanisms in pathogenesis is a lack of direct chemical evidence that oxygen centered free radicals actually arise in living tissues in quantities sufficient to cause serious damage this investigation was conducted to validate the use of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso as a quantitative molecular probe for the generation of hydroxyl radicals ho under physiologic conditions reaction of ho with dmso produces methane sulfinic acid msa as a primary product which can be detected by a simple colorimetric assay to develop a method for estimating total ho production we studied two model systems the superoxide driven fenton reaction in vitro using xanthine oxidase as the source of superoxide and a computer model of fenton chemistry measured msa production both in vitro and in the computer model was a predictable function of the concentrations of dmso and competing scavengers of ho according to the principle of competition kinetics both experimental results and model calculations showed that scatchard analysis may be used to infer total ho generation despite the presence of scavengers other than dmso such as mannitol thus methane sulfinic acid production from dmso holds promise as an easily measured marker for ho formation in biologic systems pretreated with dmso and scatchard analysis of repeated experiments with varying dmso concentrations can yield an estimate of total ho generation comments this is the author accepted manuscript of babbs cf and griffin dw
