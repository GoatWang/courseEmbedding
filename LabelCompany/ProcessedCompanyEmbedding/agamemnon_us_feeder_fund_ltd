share what is a feeder fund a feeder fund is one of a number of funds that all put investment capital into an overarching umbrella fund that is called the master fund for which one investment advisor handles all portfolio investments and trading the twotiered investment structure of a feeder fund and a master fund is commonly used by hedge funds as a means of assembling a larger portfolio account by pooling investment capital profits from the master fund are then split or distributed proportionately to the feeder funds based on the percentage of investment capital they have contributed to the master fund breaking down feeder fund in a feeder fund arrangement all management fees and any performance fees due are paid by investors at the feeder fund levelthe primary purpose served by the feeder fundmaster fund structure is reduction of trading costs and overall operating costs the master fund effectively achieves economies of scale through having access to the large pool of investment capital provided by a number of feeder funds which enables it to operate less expensively than would be possible for any of the feeder funds investing on their ownthe use of this twotiered fund structure can be very advantageous when the feeder funds share common investment goals and strategies but are not appropriate for a feeder fund with a unique investment strategy or aim since those unique characteristics would be lost in the combination with other funds within a master fundstructure of feeder funds and master fundsthe feeder funds that invest capital in a master fund operate as separate legal entities from the master fund and may be invested in more than one master fund various feeder funds invested in a master fund often differ substantially from one another in terms of things such as expense fees or investment minimums and do not usually have identical net asset values nav in the same way that a feeder fund is free to invest in more than one master fund a master fund is likewise free to accept investments from a number of feeder fundsin regard to feeder funds operating in the united states it is common for the master fund to be established as an offshore entity this frees up the master fund to accept investment capital from both taxexempt and ustaxable investors if however an offshore master fund elects to be taxed as a partnership or limited liability company llc for us tax purposes then onshore feeder funds receive passthrough treatment of their share of the master funds gains or losses thus avoiding double taxation trading center master

feeders this is the third in a series of foley advisers about fatca the new us tax regime designed to combat offshore tax evasion by us taxpayers that will go into effect on january    our prior installments described fatca compliance for  us standalone funds and us feeder funds with only us investors part one click here and  us master funds with offshore feeder funds that are treated as corporations for us tax purposes part two click here  this part three focuses on preliminary fatca compliance for offshore master funds with onshore and offshore feeder funds – for example a cayman islands master treated as a partnership for us tax purposes with a delaware limited partnership feeder and a cayman islands feeder treated as a corporation for us tax purposes  the following discussion assumes that the offshore master fund is required to be fatcacompliant offshore funds  master and feeder the specific fatca compliance obligations of an offshore master fund or an offshore feeder fund will depend on the country in which such offshore fund is organized  the united states currently is in the process of concluding fatcarelated intergovernmental agreements “igas” with countries throughout the world based on two model agreements  the model  iga and the model  iga   an offshore fund organized in a model  jurisdiction will refer to the applicable model  iga and local law to determine its fatca compliance requirements  in contrast an offshore fund organized in either a model  jurisdiction or in a country that is not a party to an iga generally will refer to the us fatca regulations to determine its fatca compliance requirements regardless of whether your offshore fund is located in a country that is a model  model  or noniga jurisdiction you must take the following preliminary steps registration  you must register each offshore fund entity with the irs using the online “fatca registration portal” which will be accessible through the irs’s website no later than july     upon successful registration each of the offshore funds will receive a global intermediary identification number “giin” a special taxpayer identification number for fatca purposes and its name and giin will be included in an online list of fatcacompliant entities that will be first published in december  and then will be updated on a monthly basis fatca agreement  as part of the registration process an offshore fund that is organized in a model  or noniga jurisdiction will be required to enter into an agreement with the irs pursuant to which the offshore fund will agree to undertake certain due diligence obligations with respect to its current and future owners submit information returns to the irs with respect to certain us owners and conduct withholding on payments or allocations of certain ussource income to nonus entity owners that fail to comply with fatca irs form w  the offshore master fund must maintain a valid irs form w for its us feeder fund in its files irs form w  once the offshore funds have registered and obtained their giins each offshore fund should immediately complete a new “postfatca” irs form w the offshore master fund should maintain a valid “postfatca” irs form w for the offshore feeder fund in its files and verify on an ongoing basis that the offshore feeder fund and its giin continue to be included in the published irs list of   fatcacompliant entities in addition the offshore master fund should prepare its own valid “postfatca” irs form w and furnish it to entities in which it invests if required if the offshore master fund invests in another entity that is a “withholding agent” for fatca purposes such as an unrelated us investment fund or an unrelated nonus investment fund that is subject to fatca in a fundoffunds structure and such investment was or is made prior to january   you generally will have a grace period until june   to provide the offshore master fund’s “postfatca” irs form w and giin to the withholding agent in order to avoid the fatca withholding tax   in contrast if the offshore master fund makes an initial investment in an entity that is a withholding agent on or after january   you generally will have  days from the date on which the offshore master fund acquires the interest to provide this information to the withholding agent regardless of the applicable deadlines you should begin the fatca registration process  with respect to existing offshore funds as soon as possible after registration opens in july  and  with respect to offshore funds formed after the fatca registration portal becomes accessible as soon as possible thereafter onshore feeder fund in order to ensure that the onshore feeder fund is fatcacompliant you should follow the procedures in part one click here if the onshore feeder fund has only us investors or the procedures in part two click here if the onshore feeder fund has us and nonus investors  in either case the onshore feeder fund should provide the offshore master fund with a valid irs form w if it has not done so already the foregoing discussion is limited to the preliminary fatca compliance obligations of offshore masterfeeder structures  offshore entities that must be fatcacompliant will have additional ongoing obligations to maintain their compliance with fatca  you should review your fund and subscription documents to ensure that they contain appropriate provisions to enable the offshore master fund and its onshore and offshore feeder funds to fulfill their additional fatca compliance obligations including provisions requiring investors to provide any needed information under fatca fatca compliance is casespecific  if you would like more detailed information regarding fatca please contact kip cawley rick schaulyoder nicola lemay or your foley hoag lawyer  not all foreign entities must be fatcacompliant many factors including source and type of income affiliations with other foreign entities and business relationships may affect the determination of whether a foreign entity must be fatcacompliant an analysis of these factors and a discussion of this determination are outside the scope of this foley adviser↩  most countries in which offshore funds typically are organized including the cayman islands and the british virgin islands have executed or currently are negotiating model  igas↩  we will publish another foley adviser regarding access to the portal after the irs makes the information available↩  even if an offshore fund completes the registration process in july  the irs will not begin issuing giins until october ↩  an offshore fund organized in a model  jurisdiction will not be required to enter into a fatca agreement but will have similar responsibilities under the applicable model  iga and local law including the obligation to collect information about its owners and furnish information to its local taxing authority with respect to certain us owners which information then will be shared with the irs↩  existing versions of irs form w are not sufficient the irs intends to issue new versions of form w specifically for fatca purposes we will publish another foley adviser with links to these “postfatca” forms w after the irs makes the final versions of such forms available↩  the applicable grace period for offshore funds with pre investments in nonus entities organized in iga jurisdictions may vary depending upon the terms of the applicable iga↩  these deadlines also apply to offshore feeder funds and are based on the date an offshore feeder fund acquires its interest in an offshore master fund↩ written by christopher r k cawley nicola lemay view or download pdf related industries investment management » related practices fund formation »
