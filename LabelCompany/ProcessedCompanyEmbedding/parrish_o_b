the founder of female health company celebrates five years of fda approval for the unique device this month by kaitlyn jakola published march   launch gallery female health company’s ob parrish   photo colleen durkin the chicagobased female health company makes the fc female condom a device that’s available in the us and roughly  countries worldwide its founder ob parrish gave an interview as the company’s unique device approached its fifth year of fda approval you make the only female condom that’s been approved by the fda which ok’ed your latest model five years ago this month what is it exactly a nitrile polymer tube—shaped like a male condom except larger—with a ring inside on one end and an open ring on the other it protects the vaginal wall from contact with sperm or any sexually transmitted disease how is it used it’s inserted the same way as a tampon the inner ring lies back in the vaginal canal against the cervix and anchors it internally    the material tends to warm to body temperature more quickly than latex does and it can be inserted hours in advance of intercourse how far in advance there’s no specific timeline but certainly somebody could put it in before she went out for an evening so women can walk around with it in yes it’s much less disruptive to the sex act the male doesn’t have to stop during the process to put a condom on because it’s already there did you invent it it was essentially invented by a danish physician who then sold it to a group in london shartex they got approval to manufacture it but they had no interest in marketing it they told us “if you market it we will sell you the worldwide rights” what made you think this product would be a success we felt that aids—which was originally a disease of gay males and drug users—would affect both sexes and spread worldwide and that it would be very unlikely an easy cure would be found we wanted to provide women especially women in the developing world where rates of infection are often much higher with opportunities to protect themselves just how effective is the female condom against aids a study of sex workers in madagascar conducted in  by the country’s ministry of health found that if female condoms are available as an option in addition to male condoms there is a  to  percent increase of protected sex acts and a lower incidence of sexually transmitted infections how effective is it against pregnancy used correctly the female condom is about  percent effective versus about  percent effective for the male condom who are your customers about  percent of the business is public sector we sell our condoms to the united nations population fund—which in turn distributes them in various countries—as well as to some ministries of health like in brazil or south africa so a person can’t buy one at say walgreens we’re in  walgreens nationwide a threepack sells for  you stepped down from the ceo role in january who took the job karen king who comes from dutch company royal dsm where she was selling specialized technical services to the pharmaceutical industry she has substantial experience on the manufacturing side that’s important it must be nice to have monopoly power how’s female health company doing we haven’t seen a loss since  last year we sold  million female condoms and our revenues were  million the company’s stock however fell  percent for the  months ending january  that’s still pretty small how big could the business get the male condom market is about  billion per year    if we got  percent of that that would be pretty neat   share edit module

based on the company’s current plans and strategies such forwardlooking statements reflect the company’s current assessment of the risks and uncertainties related to its business the company’s actual

currency risks capacity efficiency supply constraints the ability to execute on new business strategies and other risks detailed in the company’s press release shareholder communications and securities and exchange commission filings for additional information regarding such risks the company urges you to review its q and k sec filings i would now like to turn the conference call over to mr ob parrish sir please go ahead ob parrish jamie thank you welcome to the female health company’s fourth quarter  conference call michele greco our executive vice president and cfo is here with me in our chicago office before i get started on the fhc report i would like to note that it is december st it’s world aids day and the th meeting of the international conference on aids hivaids and associated diseases in africa is underway in zimbabwe we are happy to have that conference and representative and have a program with indiscernible and one of those at that conference is looking out the development of plwha of evidencebased interventions for hivaids and associated disease in the post turning to our report this morning i will make some general comments regarding the status of the company then i will cover the financial results some key factors that may impact future results and the outlook as usual when i refer to years i am referring to the company’s fiscal year which ended september th unless otherwise noted first i am pleased to report that the company posted growth for the quarter and  second my review of opportunities and challenges since me assuming this position we believe the company has a positive future which wants the basis for increasing shareholder value on the longterm basis for the fourth quarter unit sales totaled  million up  from the prior year quarter net revenues totaled  million an increase of  from  million in the prior year quarter gross profit increased  to  million or  of revenue compared with  million or  of net revenues in the prior year quarter operating expenses of  million for the fourth quarter showed no increase over the prior year reflecting the increase revenues and flat expenses operating income totaled  versus a loss of  in the prior year quarter net income increased to  or  per diluted share from a loss of  or a loss of  per diluted share in the prior year quarter for the month period unit sales increased  to  million revenues increased  to  million compared to the prior year period gross profit increased  to  million or  of sales compared to  million or  of sales in  operating expenses for the  months period increased  million or  to  million the significant portion of the increase was attributable as a result of market development distribution fees on nitrile most of the rest was attributable to certain sum ph payments fc developments and diversification operating income increased  to  million for an operating margin of  versus  million and operating margin of  in  net income increased  to  million from  million net income per diluted share increased  to  per diluted share from  per diluted share in  turning to cash flow cash flow from operations for the year was a negative  million including a negative change in operating assets of  million this was attributable to the increase in receivables due to the brazilian tender i should note the brazilian receivables totaled  million this is offset by what we owe them which is about  million within a net receivable effect of  million we did advise that payment could be received as early as february or as late as april our cash position at the end of november is about  million i should note that we have received significant orders from brazil over year period during those period we have experienced late payments for six months or more under some circumstances but never revolt as a result we are confident we will be paid but i should note that our record on all other clients in terms of ontime payment on life of defaulters is very strong the company does remain debtfree and has an unused  million line of credit turning to tax loss carryforwards during the period ended december   the valuation allowance on the company’s deferred tax assets was fully reversed as a result the company no longer recognizes significant tax benefits on its pl statements however it is very important to note that the operating loss carryforwards will continue to be utilized to reduce cash payments for taxes charged for  the company recorded tax expense of  although we paid only  of taxes or just  of the total charge recorded this resulted in cash savings of  the company’s tax loss carryforwards of  million in state and  million in federal in the united states and  million in the uk which maybe used to reduce future tax payments and save cash i should note the uk tax loss carryforwards do not expire in summary i’m pleased with the results the results reflect an increase in demand on a longterm basis in my view in the company’s market leadership and capitalizing on this opportunity we have five factors that create longterm growth potential for the company and five opportunities to increase shareholder value first is a basic need which i call routinely hivaids remains the leading cause of death among women  to  years of age  or more of all people living with and new cases of hivaids are women and the market for female condoms is only a fraction of market for male condoms reflecting significant gender equity the second factor is advocacy due to basic market need and gender equity in terms of protection in indiscernible well organized professional women’s group are actively advocating for increased investment in and availability of seasonal condoms very few companies have independent well funded organized groups advocating for increased use of their products as we speak the global female condom conference  is taking place in durban south africa the conference was organized by the universal access to female condoms uafc and durban based advocacy group attendees include representatives from throughout the world the company is actively involved in supporting this meeting by presenting and exhilarating at the board and in panel discussion participation the sole purpose of this meeting is to create universal access to female condoms we believe this will contribute to a longterm market growth on a global basis the third factor is changes in the us market as a result of these changes we believe there is an opportunity to sell direct to consumers on a complementary basis to our public sector marketing these changes include the following female condoms are now reimbursable under the affordable care act or obamacare there is an increased public focus on preventing unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted disease among young women there is an increased role of social media and marketing team of women there is an increased us drug retailer interest in contributing to health care such as instore clinics or as we read elimination of cigarettes there have also been proposals which i believe will be able to leverage in some states soon to promote pharmacies to prescribe birth control there is also an increase in online purchasing of personal care products in part reflecting these changes fc can now be purchased online from a variety of websites including amazoncom walgreenscom drugstorecom myqueststorecom and shopfemalehealthcom the interest on multiple websites in selling fc reflects increasing consumer interest the company’s under process is systematically testing direct to the consumer market here in the us this includes social marketing and instore promotion we believe that this could be complementary to public sector marketing and increased overall fc public awareness and use in this country this test will be completed early in  and if favorable the program will be implemented which we believe will significantly impact future results in a positive manner the fourth factor is competition and the relationship of education and training to competition the company’s head competition involved public sector market for more than three years the first competitive product was cleared by who on june of  to date the competition hasn’t been able to attain a significant share of the market on a global basis even sometimes with lower pricing one example may illustrate why we provide significant education and training for the use of fc competition has provided education and training for products of different design in fc in one country where competitive products were distributed the actual use rate result of product was distantly used in fc purchase so it’s not simply the price for product that accounts but the price for protected sex acts for example these figures are just hypothetical with  condoms were purchased for  but there were only  protected sex acts across protected sex act would be  again hypothetically the thousands condoms were purchased for  and there were  protected sex acts across where protected sex acts would be  and this could be translated onto comparing it to the dollar saved by treatment avoiding this cost from the cost per dollar saved matter of fact product designs specific education and training is related to the rate of use of a product and in this case it could be a barrier to the entry of products with different designs and lesson providing education and training the fifth factor and probably the most important factor in the longterm is diversification we have been looking at this for a period of time and recently have been focused on execution we have identified some specific opportunities which are proprietary and involve product differentiation which we believe could positively impact shareholder value and our target is to complete such a transaction in  now i’d like to turn to the guidance and outlook for the company due to the periodtoperiod volatility of the public sector business we don’t provide specific guidance however we do provide general guidance regarding the outlook for the company i believe the outlook for the company is that increased shareholder value is positive for four reasons the market for female condoms will continue to reflect periodtoperiod volatility as we have experienced over the past but also will continue to grow in the longterm reflecting this trend today the company has sold more than  million female condoms our average annual compound unit sales growth rate for  years is  per year competition has grown who is going to available for more than three years has not significantly penetrated the global market to date no other female condom has been approved by fda the company is and will continue to be the market leader even with the competition secondly opportunities exist to expand public sector fc sales in multiple countries we have an excellent base to do so with registration and distribution in  countries this opportunity can be accessed by need related marketing coupled with gender based advocacy that i mentioned earlier in such countries third changes in the us market that i mentioned provide a new opportunity for our complementary directtoconsumer with public sector marketing to substantially expand our distribution and unit revenues in the us just as a side note we expect fc in addition to the websites i mentioned earlier to be available for online purchasing through additional websites including walmartcom paymorecom  and cvscom in the near future and finally given specific execution we believe there is an opportunity for diversification that will be realized in  management’s focus will be at execution growth returns on investment and shareholder value i personally believe that company is undervalued at the current level to help correct this and communicate with investors michele and i are embarking on the series of investor meetings beginning december rd in los angeles at the ld micro main event conference where we will make a presentation and have oneonone schedules such on schedule with nine institutional investors we plan to have an aggressive investor relations meetings program throughout the rest of this year and during  now we’ll take some questions jamie questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and we do have a question from russell mollen from nine ten capital please go ahead with your question russell mollen hello ob parrish yes russell mollen hey how are you doing ob parrish good russell mollen quick question for you i know in the past you guys have kind of briefly touched on whether or not you think unit sales would be higher or lower in a given forward  months or something like that than they were in the previous fiscal year is that something that you would be have any insight on today or whether or not you think you would be doing more than  million units in fiscal ’ ob parrish we have a very specific forecast on that russell i assume is to what it would be russell mollen got it okay operator operator instructions our next question comes from jerry falkner from rj falkner please go ahead with your question jerry falkner hello ob and michele how you all doing ob parrish hello jerry falkner can you hear me ob ob parrish yeah jerry falkner okay i’m sorry it’s hard to hear you i was wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on the diversification program in terms of whether you are committed to staying in the female health space in terms of any acquisitions that you might make indiscernible that company is on the broader basis in just female health ob parrish i think in reference to targets i would break it down like this to the extent we have something that’s going to fit in an area where we are currently comfortable and have some expertise such as female health that’s a plus and some of the specific properties that we’re looking at right now do fit into that category there maybe other areas that would fit into various capacities we have such as getting approvals or distribution that could also be attractive but i would like to mention we have been focusing on execution we have identified some targets that represent differentiation in terms of technical difficulty and a proprietary position and some of those too are directly involved in the female health jerry falkner okay thank you operator our next question comes from eric weinstein from chancellor capital please go ahead with your question eric weinstein thanks hey ob i wanted you to talk a little bit about other business developments activities that are ongoing that could help diversify the strategy shy of doing a large transaction that is  to what extent are you talking to or seeking at strategic distribution partners for the current product or having other discussion as to potentially in license other products to distribute in addition to anything you might do on the ma front ob parrish right okay it’s a very good point a couple of points there first we are looking at some different version of fc which would be attractive in terms of colors in those things and would enhance the use and perhaps differentiated to some extent from our competition definitely we are also exploring different version of female condom which could broaden our reach that might provide us something in addition in a reference to the overall program aside from making an acquisition or purchase the problem that we are going through could very well end up towards the possibility of licensing the product or something of that nature so we are exploited beyond just as simple the acquisition thing eric weinstein okay thanks operator our next question comes from peter mcmullin from ipc global please go ahead with your question peter mcmullin hi ob it’s peter mcmullin ob parrish hi peter peter mcmullin staying with the new version of fc but i want to talk about the operating expenses which has been running higher than usual we expect some lowering of this into fiscal ‘ on an applestoapples basis ob parrish expenses we’ve been doing some investing in with evolvement some of these additional versions for fc we have made some investments to a substantial degree through taking out the diversification programs if you look at those investments we have made it is probably over a  million for the year and without any immediate returns we take in the longterm will have a substantial return from it and i’d like to mention we are able to do that and pay for and have different results and being quite profitable i think on an ongoing operating basis we could see operating expenses driven within this it would be more than what we are currently experiencing peter mcmullin thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen at this time we’ve reached the end of today’s questionandanswer session i’d like to turn the conference call back over to management for any closing remarks
