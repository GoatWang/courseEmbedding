don’t publicly admit this to enhance their profits and because we eliminate consumers lapsing and surrendering their life insurance the carriers do not like our business conversely consumers seem to love our business and you can   ​continue reading the full text by jon sabesunderstand why when you realize we have paid out more than  million directly to policy owners – as compared to the  million in surrender values offered by insurance carriers for the very same policiesour business was founded to disrupt the status quo of the life insurance industry ​new actuarial underwriting technologya key to investing in life insurance assets as well as managing pensions social security entitlements annuity liabilities and several other financial services is understanding the actuarial mortality profile of individual populations in our case the investment returns we derive from our portfolio of life insurance is based primarily on the underlying actuarial results we experience the goal of the insurance business is to develop predictable actuarial underwriting models to appropriately price and select associated products and risk the term “actuarial underwriting” is my term and industry professionals may chafe at my use of it but for me this term explains the goal of the life insurance business which is to better estimate individual lifespans across large groups of people the critical function of actuarial underwriting has changed little in more than a century historically the life insurance longterm care and annuity industries have used “medical evidenced based underwriting” to assess select and price risk in order to operate their businesses profitably medical evidenced based underwriting is exactly what it sounds like – an underwriter reviews an individual’s medical data and family history in order to develop a view of the insured’s health profile for purposes of appropriately pricing the risk associated with the product being sold because actuarial underwriting is also key to our business we began an initiative in  to reexamine the way in which we approached this process our initiative included a review of new advanced medical technologies capable of predicting aging and related mortality more accurately these technologies leveraged new developments in the examination of telomere length gene expression and protein expression our investigation ultimately led us to the lab of dr steve horvath a professor of human genetics and biostatistics at the university of california los angeles ucla dr horvath is a recognized expert on aging who has focused his research on the root causes of aging that are encoded in the dna moleculein  dr horvath reported that human cells have an internal “biological age” and “biological clock” at the dna molecular level that is indicative of the aging process the research was hailed as groundbreaking and featured in the scientific journal of ​nature the study of chemical modifications to the dna molecule that reveal aging among other things is now a cutting edge science known as epigenetics epigenetics is the study of how the dna molecule’s instructions are translated into the production of proteins that make us who we are in other words while scientists unraveled the sequence of our dna molecular code in  in many ways only now are they beginning to understand how that code translates into our individual makeup dr horvath’s epigenetic research has focused on methylation sites on our dna  million methylation sites on the human dna molecule in order to study the genetic and epigenetic determinants of aging and mortality ​​in  dr horvath reported a discovery upon completion of a statistical analysis of over  individual dna samples he was able to identify a specific set of dna methylationbased biomarkers that could be used to predict individual risk of allcause mortality the implications of the discovery are simple and profound individual lifespans can now be estimated with significantly greater precision across large groups of peoplewe are working right now to translate this technology into an actuarial underwriting methodology that we believe will be revolutionary we expect to immediately begin implementing this technology to enhance our current underwriting processes and we believe the recently evolved technology of identifying epigenetic biomarkers to forecast actuarial mortality will create a marked leap forward to better assess select and price risk for the life insurance longterm care and annuity businesses fintech – insurtech opportunity we believe the incumbent industry has no incentive to change we believe the incumbent industry has little ability to change we believe the incumbent industry lacks the imagination to reinvent itself from within we believe the incumbent is vulnerable we know the  trillion life insurance industry provides grossly inadequate surrender values to consumers who own life insurance we know this because we have lived it for over ten years in addition we have learned that the life insurance industry has built a cumbersome underwriting apparatus that makes the process of selling life insurance more challenging than ever has not evolved its products to address consumer needs and has not employed advanced technologies to assess select and price risk industry insiders observers and professional commentators have been actively writing about the existence of major fintech and insurtech opportunities within the insurance industry insurance industry leaders acknowledge that “…advancements such as dna testing potentially upending the insurer’s ability to assess and select acceptable risks” is a reality periodicals and news articles are replete in highlighting the fact that the insurance industry business is ripe for a disruptive fintech reinvention industry observers and commentators also suggest that reinvention must come from outside the industry we believe there is a tremendous opportunity for our disruptive financial services company to reinvent the life insurance industry using our predictive biomarker technology we believe our technology has the potential to upend a century of entrenched incumbent practices in the life insurance businesses in addition we believe our technology may open new markets where traditional medical evidenced based underwriting is either impractical or impossible conclusionso what are we doing about it our team does not consist of traditional life insurance industry professionals rather our team consists of financial entrepreneurs who have been working on the backend of the life insurance industry along the way we have asked simple questions about complex industry problems and searched for innovative solutions to address the problems we encounter and the opportunities we perceive since inception our business has been and always will be a disruptive outsider to the life insurance industry today we are seeking to provide consumers additional value for their life insurance by upsetting the status quo of high policy lapse rates and low surrender values enjoyed by life insurance carriers for years and now with the announcement that we are exercising our option to exclusively license “dna methylation based predictor of mortality ” technology from the university of california los angeles ucla we have acquired technology that will not only make us smarter in our current business but also gives us the opportunity to effect an elegant paradigm shift in actuarial underwriting methodology ​we believe our corporate lineage is fitting as it was the very existence of the life insurance secondary market that drove elizur wright the “father of life insurance” to reinvent what we know as the modern day life insurance industry by establishing regulations that require insurance carriers to provide surrender values to consumers – and it’s the secondary market that will once again drive another reinvention of the industry and this time the reinvention will come from technology and market forces seeking to capitalize on the fintech – insurtech opportunity is the next logical step for our corporate story values and mission as we are uniquely situated to creatively disrupt and reinvent the life insurance industryso our secret master plan is as follows​first we are going to use technology to greatly improve our current business second we are going to use technology to enter the primary markets of the life insurance business third we are going to use technology to expand all aspects of the life insurance longterm care and annuity businesses andfourth we are going to rewrite centuryold outdated practices and provide consumers with new valueadded insurance products that meet their modern day needs please don’t tell anyone our planps i am publishing our secret master plan in homage to elon musk and his  post of the secret tesla motors master plan musk’s bold transparent entrepreneurial vision coupled with his initiative to take action is inspiring to any entrepreneur seeking to do the same  linkshere are links to more information about the technology and how it was inventeddna methylation and mortality prediction national institute of health drhorvath lecture ucla newsroom article on mortality predictor dr steve horvath biography at ucla dna methylation age of human tissues biomarkers and ageing the clockwatcher frequently asked questionsfaqs about the technology and how gwg may integrate it into its businesswhat is the licensing agreement gwg announced november    we announced that we have exercised an option to license dna technology from ucla that was invented by one of ucla’s professors the leading expert on dna technology and the aging of human cells our license is exclusive and we feel this puts us ahead of the rest of the industry in working to apply this technology to the insurance industrywhat is this technology it’s called “dna methylation” and it is the mechanism that records the “biological age” progression of human cells which is independent from “chronological age” progression in  dr horvath reported a discovery upon completion of a statistical analysis of over  individual dna samples he was able to identify a specific set of dna methylationbased biomarkers that could be used to predict individual risk of allcause mortality the implications of the discovery are simple and profound individual lifespans can now be estimated with significantly greater precision across large groups of individuals how will it be used and how will it affect gwg’s current businesswe are working to find ways to integrate aspects of this technology into our underwriting protocols to help us make better decisions about the life insurance policies we purchase we will keep you posted on how we are using this technology in our business as well as any other opportunities we identify for its usewhat is your motivation for doing this as a leader in the life insurance secondary market for more than ten years we have had a front row seat to how the key parts of this industry operate we believe these new technologies present the potential to upend a century of entrenched incumbent practices in the life insurance longterm care and annuity businesseswill this mean that gwg will change the process it uses for purchasing life insurance policies on the secondary market we believe it has the potential to lead to changes in our process but we are still working on what exactly that will meanwhen do you think you will implement this technology into your current business ​ we are just beginning the work of determining how to use the technology in our business we will keep you posted on the progress we make and any new methods we develophow is this technology different from the home dna tests i see online think of it this way comparing dna methylation to home dna tests is like comparing a team of major leaguers to a little league team they use the same basic rules and the final score might look the same but a major league team has skills little leaguers are a decade away from approaching who is involved in this project we have assembled
