aav aav aavrh and over  other novel aav vectors nav vectors we currently have exclusive rights to over  patents and patent applications worldwide covering our nav vectors including composition of matter claims for aav aav aav and aavrh as well as methods for their manufacture and therapeutic uses we believe this patent portfolio forms a strong foundation for our current programs and with our ongoing research and development we expect to continue to expand this robust patent portfolio   the foundation of our nav technology platform was discovered in an effort to identify next generation aav vectors that could overcome the limitations of earlier generation aav vectors aav through aav we believe the key benefits of nav vectors over earlier generation aav vectors potentially include   • higher gene expression • longerterm gene expression • broad and novel tissue selectivity • lower immune response • improved manufacturability we believe our nav technology platform is proving to be a significant advancement over earlier aav vectors in delivering these therapies based on data derived from thirdparty clinical studies and animal models using our nav vectors we believe our nav technology platform possesses unique beneficial properties that are not seen in earlier generation aavs we believe that our nav technology platform which underpins our internal development programs

contact us to discuss partnering or licensing opportunities   therapeutic programs  regenxbio regenxbio programs rgx rgx is our product candidate for the treatment of wet agerelated macular degeneration amd rgx is being developed as a novel onetime subretinal treatment for wet amd that includes the nav aav vector encoding a gene for a monoclonal antibody fragment the expressed protein is designed to neutralize vascular endothelial growth factor vegf activity modifying the pathway for formation of new leaky blood vessels and retinal fluid accumulation   wet amd is characterized by loss of vision due to excess blood vessel formation between two layers of cells in the retina this excess blood vessel formation results in fluid leakage that can result in physical changes in the structure of the retina and changes in vision as this process becomes more severe blindness can result from scar formation due to hemorrhaging   current antvegf therapies require repetitive and inconvenient intraocular injections typically ranging from every four to eight weeks in frequency to maintain efficacy due to a variety of factors including inconvenience and discomfort associated with frequent injections in the eye patient compliance is a significant concern with antivegf therapies patients often experience vision loss with reduced frequency of treatment   we are currently enrolling patients with wet amd in a phase i clinical trial of subretinally delivered rgx rgx rgx is our product candidate for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia hofh which is designed to use the aav vector to deliver the human lowdensity lipoprotein receptor ldlr gene to liver cells   hofh is a monogenic disorder caused by abnormalities in the function or expression of the ldlr gene hofh patients have very low levels or are completely deficient of ldlr resulting in very high total blood cholesterol levels this leads to premature and aggressive plaque buildup life threatening coronary artery disease cad and aortic valve disease   the current standard of care in hofh focuses on early initiation of aggressive treatment due to severe clinical effects of elevated ldlc available therapies do not provide a cure and their use is limited due to tolerability and drug availability   we believe that the liver is the preferred target organ for gene therapy of hofh since ldlrs produced in the liver contribute to greater than  percent of the capture and breakdown of ldl making the liver by far the most important ldlr producing organ   we together with trial sponsor university of pennsylvania are currently enrolling patients with hofh in a phase iii clinical trial of intravenously administered rgx rgx has received orphan drug product designation from the fda rgx rgx is our product candidate for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type i mps i which is designed to use the aav vector to deliver the human αliduronidase idua gene to the central nervous system cns mps i is a rare recessive genetic disease caused by deficiency of idua an enzyme required for the breakdown of polysaccharides heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in the lysosomes of cells many patients develop symptoms related to glycosaminoglycan storage in the cns which can include excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain hydrocephalus spinal cord compression and cognitive impairment   current standard of care treatments cannot treat the cns manifestations of mps i and leave a significant unmet need for a method to safely achieve longterm idua reconstitution in the cns   delivery of the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the cns could provide a permanent source of secreted idua beyond the bloodbrain barrier allowing for longterm cross correction of cells throughout the cns   we expect to file an ind for rgx for the treatment of mps i in mid and expect to begin enrollment in a phase iii clinical trial in the second half of  rgx has received orphan drug product and rare pediatric disease designation from the fda rgx rgx is our product candidate for the treatment of mucopolysaccharidosis type ii mps ii also known as hunter syndrome which is designed to use the aav vector to deliver the human iduronatesulfatase ids gene to the central nervous system cns   mps ii is a rare xlinked recessive disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme ids in severe forms of the disease early developmental milestones may be met but developmental delay is readily apparent by  to  months developmental progression begins to plateau between three and five years of age with regression reported to begin around six and a half years   specific treatment to address the neurological manifestations of mps ii and prevent or stabilize cognitive decline remains a significant unmet medical need   delivery of the gene encoding the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the cns could provide a permanent source of secreted ids beyond the bloodbrain barrier allowing for longterm cross correction of cells throughout the cns we believe this strategy could also provide rapid ids delivery to the brain potentially preventing the progression of cognitive deficits that otherwise occur in hunter syndrome patients   preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic benefit of aavmediated ids gene delivery to the cns through the cerebrospinal fluid to address neurological manifestations of mps ii we intend to file an ind in mid to support the initiation of an early phase doseescalation clinical trial of rgxbased gene delivery via cns administration in subjects with mps ii rgx has received orphan drug product and rare pediatric disease designation from the fda   sign up to receive updates on regenxbio and our programs sign

multicenter openlabel multiplecohort doseescalation study in adult subjects with wet amd in the united states the study is expected to include approximately eighteen previously treated wet amd subjects that are responsive to antivascular endothelial growth factor antivegf therapy and are  years of age or older the study is designed to evaluate three doses of rgx  ×  genome copies gceye  ×  gceye and  ×  gceye primary endpoints include adverse events certain laboratory measures including immunological parameters and ocular examinations and imaging including bcva and sdoct the primary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rgx at  weeks after a single dose of rgx administered by subretinal delivery following completion of the primary study period it is expected that subjects will enter the followup period and will continue to be assessed until week  to assess long term safety and durability of effect rgx is being developed as a onetime
