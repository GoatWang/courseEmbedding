the day sponsor listing a perfect ten in sandy springs see all homes of the day view slideshow  photos jake bergmann ceo of surterra holdings inc  manager of valkyrie capital llc a new atlanta company is positioning itself to be a leader in georgias medical marijuana industry before the industry even takes root surterra holdings inc is focused on the legalization of cannabisbased medicines and plans to help create a business infrastructure which will allow the production distribution and sale of medical marijuana products in georgia view slideshow  photos jake bergmann ceo of surterra holdings inc  manager of valkyrie capital llc we are trying to be very proactive in the early stages of helping make sure the legalization makes sense from a business standpoint said jake bergmann founder and ceo of surterra by helping on the front side we hope businesses that want to be involved in the industry would come to us because through our expertise and capital we can help them get set up and running bergmann expects some form of a medical marijuana bill will pass during the  georgia general assembly he estimates it will cost between  million and  million to build out the industrys infrastructure wes vandyk chief operating officer at surterra said the two spent a lot of time looking at different regulatory models in colorado california and other states that have legalized medical cannabis weve done everything we can to research and develop a system that would make sense in southern states as we see this legalization process move across the country from a medicinal standpoint vandyk said we did a lot of bootsontheground research in some of the more developed markets and looked at the existing political and business environments to identify viable companies to invest in or learn from as we saw the trend moving across the country from west to east bergmann and vandyk met rep allen peake rmacon just before the first meeting of georgias medical cannabis study committee which was created after last years medical marijuana bill died in the general assembly that bill would have legalized use of certain kinds of marijuana specifically cannabis oil for children with seizures peake on nov  prefiled a new proposed law house bill  which has been dubbed the haleighs hope act to read it visit httpbizjusit it would grant georgia families the right to use cannabis oil to treat certain seizure disorders in both children and adults peake said surterra appears to be very well funded and to have a very workable business model they have provided some really good input on how to set up the business model and what works and what does not work in a potential piece of legislation peake said of bergmann and vandyk thats crucial and its vitally important that we draft a bill that works in the real world because if all of a sudden we draft a bill like florida where the rules and regulations become so burdensome and cumbersome that its impossible to get the business off the ground and running so that citizens can have access to what the legislation intended then weve failed peake said there will be a limited number of medical cannabis licenses and a high bar will be set for potential licensees not just anybody can come off the street and all of a sudden grow marijuana peake said theyre going to have a viable business model with a high standard of character and a business plan that is proven to be able to work peake said he is looking at allotting five or six licenses for medical marijuana maybe thats five or six vertically integrated businesses or one or two that are vertically integrated with two or three growers two or three processors and two or three distributors peake said were trying to keep it small so theres not a burden on law enforcement to oversee it and provide security thats needed and so theres not a big burden on the state bureaucracy to oversee the licensing process and the enforcement of the licensing process christian sederberg a partner at the denverbased law firm vicente sederberg llc which does marijuana work around the county said georgia could play an important role in the national medical marijuana movement because the proposed bill allows for higher amounts of the psychoactive drug thc marijuana contains another chemical known as cannabidiol or cbd which has additional medical effects this is a very tight and regulated system that is being proposed sederberg said it is a very patientfocused system and it addresses one of the big concerns in an interesting and new way which is the  thc to cbd ratio as being a limit for thc according to a study conducted by ethan russo and published by an academic publishing company that publishes medical and scientific literature elsevier the combination of thc and cbd increases clinical efficacy while reducing adverse events the georgia system is different in that it allows higher levels of thc than the cbdonly or verylowthc type of bills but it limits the upside of the amount of thc and really focuses more on medical products for patients sederberg said the general assembly will convene on jan  phil w hudson is a music sports and finance

licenses have a clear advantage in being the first to reach commercialization which is a critical factor to success in any nascent industry these pioneers of lowthc medical marijuana will also have an inside track to wider marijuana cultivation in texas in case lawmakers ever relax the states rules the lowthc cbd products permitted under the compassionate use program are different from the cbd oil already available to texas consumers unlike marijuanaderived cbd oil hempderived cbd oil contains no more than  percent thc said sheila hemphill policy director of the texas hemp industries association go here for more background on the differences that confusion led dps last fall to confiscate hempderived cbd products from austin locations of peoples rx the agency later decided not to

first cannabis farm  agfundernews search search for accelerators  startups agtech agtech funding company profiles industry investment news series b from concept to cultivator how surterra therapeutics launched florida’s first cannabis farm march   louisa burwoodtaylor  comment last month surterra therapeutics broke records to become the first fully licensed cannabis farm growing the plant in florida the medical cannabis cultivation processing and dispensary company expects to sell its first products by june well ahead of the day rule from the department of health doh and keeping it months ahead of any competition surterra’s willingness to take on some risk by building its first facility — a  square foot indoor farm — before getting initial approval last november is one of the main reasons it is the first to start growing cannabis after the doh inspected the facility last month according to jake bergman founder and ceo of surterra “we did a lot of preparation at the same time as pursuing a licence to prove we were serious about investing our time and efforts in building state of the art facilities we wanted to prove we were ready to go” he told agfundernews “many groups in florida have not done that but we thought it was the right thing to do and in some ways it derisked the selection process as we could show the department of health pictures of the facility under construction so that they knew we were professional players” surterra formed when bergman and his cofounders were researching various sectors for individual managed funds legal cannabis “kept cropping up” and they started researching the sector in  according to bergman as they started doing due diligence they found that the sector was still very disorganized and unprofessional “we also felt that in the states where it was legal everyone had overlooked the true medical benefits of cannabis production” he said “when you go to colorado it’s very much ‘wink wink nod nod’ among those buying and selling cannabis products we saw demand for conditions like epilepsy parkinson’s disease and cancer that noone was addressing in a therapeutic fashion” surterra is a verticallyintegrated company cultivating processing and dispensing medical cannabis products into the market and the company does all of this through one licence — this differs from other states that issue separate licences for each part of the chain there are still separate steps for each process however and surterra was the first to obtain its cultivation approval it’s now in the process of getting approval from processing and dispensing which should go through around may or june florida is only issuing five licenses but these licences do not restrict how many facilities one company can operate surterra is about to open its second facility a series of shipping container pods growing cannabis hydroponically these containers will be fully climate controlled with automated lighting metered water and seed to sale tracking “it’s almost as automated as you can be” said wes van dyk cofounder and chief operating officer the existing  square foot indoor farm which is in northern  florida is also climate controlled but is hand watered and the plants grow in soil rather than hydroponically surterra is using two different growing conditions as an ab test to find out which is the most effective to measure this and also to ensure compliance with the law the company uses tracking software it’s about to transfer from one called agrasoft to another called priva this software will track every interaction with the plant when a clone is made when a plant is transferred the exact amount of water or nutrients given every interaction an employee has with a plant this will produce monthly reports for the doh and enable any queries or complaints from patients to be addressed by tracking the product all the way through the supply chain to the individual plant at the facilities surterra engages in some simple processing to extract oils from the plants in a similar process to creating vanilla extract according to bergman from there the company makes a range of products such as gel caps a dropper solution topical creams and transthermal patches “it’s very important we provide patients with a variety of options so they can use whatever methods of administration work best for them” he said “we want this to be a patientdriven business” these products will also have tailored ingredients depending on the condition they’re addressing for example an epilepsy product will have no more than  percent thc but  to  times more cbd depending on the patient the oil extracts are condensed down to these exact ratios through basic natural chemistry processes similar to cooking according to bergman surterra has raised funding over two rounds so far a k seed round in the summer of  involving friends and family and some high net worth individuals and a  million series a from existing investors and the corporate venture arm of a technology company in atlanta according to bergman while institutional investors interested in the cannabis sector have been few and far between surterra has had investment and interest from the owners and managers of investment management funds “we’ve often found that the owner of a hedge fund and not the hedge fund itself makes the investment” he said and the few cannabisfocused investment funds around have yet to raise enough capital or be the right fit for surterra at this point he added “we are a medical company so need to ensure our investors have a similar profile and interest in the sector” he said surterra is currently raising a series b round for over  million which bergman hopes to close in the summer of this year at a similar time to the opening of its first retail store cannabis won’t be prescribed but recommended by physicians surterra is currently engaging local physicians and will be holding an event with the florida medical
