ratzesberger talks about the evolutionary journey of big data analytics author archives oliver ratzesberger how curiosity saves your company … and turns your people into citizen data scientists july   i’ve written before on the importance of people sharing data as broadly as possible in an organization a company may have hundreds or even thousands of people with “analyst” in their job titles but if you keep access to data centralized you’re also keeping the capacity for innovation centralized — and limited at the same time simply opening up the data floodgates to your workforce without a solid strategy will create more confusion than success the better approach is to package up the complexity into accessible tools — analytical applications — to leverage the most valuable asset of all in your workforce curiosity in other words business analysts need an environment to follow that spark of curiosity on data issues “hmm there’s a spike over here … an aberration over there let’s experiment a little to figure out why without having to know all the complex processes happening underneath the application expanding insight across the organization such an “analytical application platform” — as the northwestern kellogg school of management’s mohan sawhney and i call it in our sentient enterprise model for big data agility — is a selfserve ondemand environment for users to follow their hunches put more pragmatically as the chief data officer at a major international bank recently told me analytical apps help “people to stop submitting tickets and get them to start thinking more analytically on their own a business manager needs to understand the levers to pull but not necessarily know all the engineering” this executive is absolutely right and in the process of building analytical apps we’re not just expanding data access — we’re also expanding the company’s seedbed for analytic insight and value when designed and implemented correctly analytic applications can foster curiosity in the user community and provide a framework for that curiosity to lead to scalable solutions this framework holds up even in the face of tough and demanding business challenges i know of cases where analytical applications have taken crm sentiment data — not all of it positive — to fuel analytic solutions allowing companies to anticipate consumer concerns more proactively and thereby boost overall customer satisfaction in fact critical business challenges are often where analytics leaders find valuable internal partners — lighthouse customers as i’ve come to call them — who welcome the assistance to create solutions and ultimately showcase for the rest of the company the value of agile analytics supporting analytic success keep in mind that just as we shouldn’t simply open up the data floodgates to your company without a strategy neither should we simply crank out analytical apps without some support systems in place while it’s important to keep bureaucracy to a minimum analytical apps do need to operate within a certain organizational framework the banking executive i mentioned for instance has a system for “insight governance” this involves deploying relationship managers to gauge analytics needs within the organization and coordinate quick development of the apps as well as super users within the various company divisions to help ensure ongoing and selfservice functioning of those apps advanced data scientists are always available to help when roadblocks or deeper analytic challenges arise the beauty of the system is the workload for these experts is naturally skewed toward these tougher challenges where they’re needed most you’ll likely find that some departments and job functions may be more receptive than others mobile and online divisions for instance tend to be familiar already with the value of data marketing departments also typically lend themselves to analytic solutions to help with intensive timeboxed product campaigns that often have clear measures of success adoption might be a bit more difficult however for an hr legal or physical asset management department but even in these areas the value of analytics becomes clear once you demonstrate for example digital analysis of server usage shows how to optimize load more efficiently and save the company money by now it’s probably clear that fostering both access and curiosity around data has to do not just with technology but also corporate culture fortunately the insight governance measures i mentioned earlier can help people share expertise more easily within the company another important way to promote culture is to recruit talent who are dataliterate from their previous training or work experience and already “get” the value of analytics all of these steps together with cuttingedge technology contribute to an environment of analytic curiosity that can help any given insight grow from interesting finding to a significant trend to that big costsaving or profitgenerating solution for more on the sentient enterprise watch my video overview on our website   breaking up the boys’ club to unlock the tech industry’s untapped potential june   a little while ago our family car needed to go to the shop for repairs i asked my wife if she would prefer to take it but she refused she worried that if the undoubtedly male mechanics saw her they wouldn’t treat her fairly she’s not alone in imagining this is the case in fact there is now a femaleowned auto shop in pennsylvania that caters to women offering salon services while they wait for an oil change patrice banks the owner and a former materials engineer also hosts a monthly car clinic for women banks’ business proves that all it takes is a concerted effort to break down diversity barriers her business has many parallels to science technology engineering and math fields in silicon valley the technology industry has garnered a poor reputation for its diversity when it comes down to it auto repair is a technology sector its skills are housed in the same stem umbrella as jobs in coding big data and basically every other scientific discipline and the social barriers that create an unconscious — and sometimes shamefully conscious — message that it is not friendly to newcomers has its roots in the same reason my wife doesn’t believe she has a fair shot at an auto shop one of patrice banks’ automotive class students put it simply “i did not know that girls could go into the automotive field” technology companies can stop enabling this cultural message by making a real effort to be more diverse themselves as employees and creative thinkers in stem fields we pride ourselves on logical thinking we imagine we are always hiring the best employee based entirely on facts rather than on personal bias and that this will result in the best workforce but any good logical thinker knows that you have to address your own biases to get real results science itself has proven that stem is full of subtle biases that challenge our ability to be diverse to cultivate a successful environment for diversity to thrive it’s not enough to ask those underrepresented to “lean in” and forge their own path ahead as an outlier all businesses should encourage grassroots diversity in stem where we can foster a future workforce that better reflects society as a whole in my experience the longterm outcome is clear — diversity in stem education leads to diversity in the workplace making technology companies function better when successful companies set out to hire or staff a project diversity needs to be at the forefront of their thinking personally i have witnessed an environment where people produce better work by making a concerted effort to be inclusive more players at the table from varied backgrounds ensures your products and solutions are more well rounded and it avoids your company from falling prey to any of the embarrassing techindustry missteps rooted in a homogenous workforce creating a wider network of employees that represents different genders races physical abilities and economic and geographic backgrounds means that your products and services will mirror that diversity technology is so ubiquitous that it’s shameful to think of it as a boys’ club or any other demographic modifier the people we imagine as our generation’s great modern thinkers are engineers and scientists being exclusive about who gets to contribute to future advancements only limits the way we can improve modern life on a daily basis each and every person on the planet is interacting with benefiting from and demanding more from their technology not listening to those voices and failing to serve those needs is not just bad corporate citizenship it’s bad business why “unsupervised” autonomous cars are right around the corner may   autonomous drive – cars and trucks that pilot themselves – is perhaps the most rapidly maturing areas of technology today i know a senior it executive at a major car company who in the late ’s served on a team dedicated to safety electronics like braking assist and lane monitoring for drowsiness detection after moving to another department within the company this executive returned to pay a visit to his old team just a couple years later and saw how the number of such point solutions had since multiplied and evolved into a unified web of analyticsdriven capabilities that – together – made autonomous drive a reality fastchanging capabilities algorithms are behind the complex ai systems that now let cars – properly equipped with sensors navigation and connectivity features – to drive and make countless traffic decisions all by themselves in realworld settings like uber’s driverless taxi experiment in pittsburgh today’s autonomous vehicles are already using advanced analytics to manage autonomous drive’s three key functions of perception prediction and motion planning perception involves understanding what the car sees is that another car a traffic light a pedestrian prediction helps the car understand what will likely happen next will that other car change lanes is that traffic light about to change will that person enter the crosswalk and motion planning involves decisions and task execution should we change lanes should we stop should we make a turn capabilities are evolving and changing by the day the “we” in autonomous driving however is one thing that hasn’t yet changed the ultimate responsibility today still lies with the driver each of those uber taxis for instance has someone behind the wheel who monitors the car’s performance neither technology nor the law has yet reached the point where an autonomous ride can truly be “unsupervised” – the gold standard of autonomous driving that means people on board the vehicle are no longer expected to have responsibility for what the car does that’s the next major frontier and analytics will get us there soon volvo in fact predicts it’ll be selling its first “unsupervised autonomous vehicles” to the public by  the embodiment of international standards for full automation in driving unsupervised autonomous drive is a big threshold that will be crossed only with high levels of confidence in the underlying analytics and systems that all work together in concert sentient cars…and companies it’s worth mentioning that this datadriven autonomy in vehicles is analogous to what happens on a macro level for an entire organization in the advanced stages of the sentient enterprise capability maturity model i created with the kellogg school of management’s mohan sawhney fueled by advanced analytics a “sentient” enterprise is proactive and can predict and adapt to changing circumstances – able to sense micro trends and make many decisions without human intervention such a company reaches these advanced levels of awareness and autonomous decisioning through seamless integration of various different analytic processes and architectures within the organization in a similar way this “system of systems” interplay of algorithms and analytic processes is what powers a selfdriving car to the point where unsupervised autonomous drive is now within sight i already mentioned systems for perception prediction and motion planning all those capabilities will continue to improve along with the systems governing connectivity processing power – and the sheer electrical power – that will be necessary to support unsupervised autonomous vehicle operation a lot of work still needs to happen to make unsupervised autonomous drive a reality but i don’t think we’ll have to wait long for it as i mentioned at the outset the pace of progress to date has taken even some industry veterans by surprise if recent history is any guide we’ll reach the next frontier of “unsupervised” sooner than you might expect – and we’ll have analytics to thank for it ai is red hot but where is all this innovation pointing us april   it’s hard to overstate just how quickly artificial intelligence ai is evolving driven by a combination of cheaper and more powerful cloud infrastructure richer data sets and new analytic techniques each new year seems to be a banner one for ai innovation advances in tasks like image and sound recognition improvisational thinking and deep learning for instance drive new predictions for growth in areas like autonomous driving voice recognition and other cuttingedge capabilities when google implemented its ai upgrade to google translate one weekend last november the sudden improvement was such that its foreign language translations of passages from “the snows of kilimanjaro” were virtually indistinguishable from hemingway’s original text recent news about machines beating humans at poker or the ancient strategy game go also point to more complex questions – like how ai and aidriven automation could displace jobs in mining administrative manufacturing finance and many other sectors some of today’s headlines even point to profound changes to societal trends for instance serious thought is now given to the prospect of a universal basic income a broader lens each innovation is impressive on its own but i think we get an even fuller understanding of them all when we look to some broader context whether this innovation juggernaut strikes you as thrilling frightening or both how do we get a handle on where it’s taking us i’m convinced that the first step is to abandon any hope of precise longterm predictions or forecasts anyone who tells you exactly what the future will look like is actually living in the past – a bygone era before moore’s law vaulted us into permanent innovation overdrive instead whether the goal is competitive advantage for one company or social harmony for the whole world i believe we should chart ai trends in terms of capabilities and how they mature by doing so we create a useful framework – if not necessarily all the fine details – of what’s to come in fact that’s what’s at the heart of the sentient enterprise model for enterprise analytics at scale that i codeveloped with kellogg school management scholar mohan sawhney we actually refer to the sentient enterprise as a capability maturity model particularly in the latter parts of our fivestage journey we look past what even the most advanced companies are doing today – and ahead to the issues we’ll all be navigating tomorrow for instance a prominent theme we address in the sentient enterprise is the humanmachine balance in making decisions as aidriven capabilities and connections continue to mature and scale more and more decisions will be made by algorithms that means an enduring challenge will be maintaining the right feedback loops between autonomous decisioning and the humans who continue to tweak and optimize how those decisions are made this example shows how we may not be able to predict the exact nature of tomorrow’s business problems but we know the humanmachine balance around decisioning will remain crucial to the solution there are many such factors and – as we see ai progress even further – i encourage you to consider the sentient enterprise framework for understanding where all this ai innovation is taking us disruption and leadership on gartner’s dmsa magic quadrant march   it’s no secret that the analytics marketplace is going through major disruption as organizations look for solutions with the power and flexibility to tackle wide ranging uses cases involving new analytics on more diverse types formats and sources of data in fact demand for next generation architectures is such that gartner has changed both the title and criteria for this year’s magic quadrant report on our sector in dropping reference to the traditional “data warehouse” and expanding its standards for excellence gartner says its criteria for the  magic quadrant for data management solutions for analytics dmsa are now “more challenging and therefore more difficult to meet”  that’s why i’m especially proud to see teradata ranked in this report as the overall leader for completeness of vision and in the top two for ability to execute teradata’s strong performance among the magic quadrant’s field of  tough competitors demonstrates what gartner calls our “market leadership in product capabilities” and “strong vision for the future”  the report summarizes how teradata’s “scores for performance across a broad range of use cases were among the best of all the vendors in this magic quadrant” and how percent of our reference customers consider us the enterprise standard for dmsa selfdisrupting for success as i mentioned this stellar performance for teradata is happening in a period of tremendous disruption  as gartner wrote in the report summary “disruption is accelerating in this market with more demand for broad solutions…in an increasingly dynamic space” indeed the dynamics have not been kind to many other key players household names who nonetheless lost ground in this magic quadrant  amid this backdrop it’s clear to me that teradata’s proactive drive to selfdisrupt and get ahead of the analytics curve over the past few years has played a major role in our success in this new report i’ve written before on selfdisruption and teradata has embraced this ethos to become a pioneer in what gartner refers to as the logical data warehouse ldw  clients rely on analytics vendors to chart the future and provide the best solutions – including flexible deployment options and hybrid cloud choices – to seize competitive advantage quite frankly i don’t think teradata could have achieved our current position with gartner as both a leader in “ability to execute” and unrivaled in “completeness of vision” if we hadn’t been so proactive with our own innovations in these areas even the standard “cautions” category which gartner includes as part of every vendor assessment reflects our surefooted progress amid a fastchanging analytics marketplace  in describing market shifts from appliancebased into cloud and softwareonly solutions gartner notes how “teradata is addressing this shift by embracing these new approaches”  and gartner commends teradata everywhere and our new licensing flexibility that helps drive down the total cost of ownership and allows customers more choice in strategically leveraging teradata resources when and where they’re needed most to satisfy business needs “best of breed” excellence gartner was one of the first analyst firms to advocate the logical data warehouse to meet increasing demand for a wide variety of analytics on diverse forms of data that can overwhelm traditional enterprise data warehouse strategies  clients need more analytic options in managing relational and nonrelational processing machine learning and other advanced applications and more organizations are incorporating the cloud for increased flexibility agility and operational pricing models teradata’s hybrid cloud solutions and our best of breed unified data architecture strategy uniquely position us to address all use cases leading gartner to acknowledge teradata’s technology as “some of the most technically advanced and capable in the dmsa market” and the “most appropriate for the most demanding analytical use cases” i should mention that teradata was also recognized in two other gartner evaluations we are one of the few technology vendors to be included in the magic quadrant for business analytics services and we appear for the first time in the magic quadrant for data sciences platforms taken together gartner’s high marks for teradata in bringing advanced analytics solutions and services to an increasingly demanding customer base are immensely gratifying  that’s because it’s a validation of all the dedication vision and ability to execute that’s driven our company – a relentless pursuit of excellence in modern analytics that continues to help customers differentiate themselves and unleash the full potential of their business teradata strengthens hybrid cloud commitment with teradata database on azure january   choice and flexibility are everything to companies sifting through all the available analytic platforms on the market today this is evident in the strong shift toward the adoption of hybrid clouds — a solution that more than  percent of teradata customers surveyed in  plan to employ by  using an analytics solution that seamlessly blends onpremises and cloudbased deployment enables our customers to focus on what matters to them — creating business value this helps them focus and eliminates the stress of implementing and maintaining their physical infrastructure on their own companies need the ability to effortlessly use the cloud when and where it works for them and as often or as infrequently as they would like they need ondemand workload shifting that meets their data analytics needs and also optimizes how they use their resources creating an easy approach to managing the system at a glance given these requirements teradata has focused on offering the same fullfeatured teradata database software via teradata everywhere that seamlessly integrates with the most powerful cloud platforms on the market that our clients are already using and for many especially in retail microsoft azure is their public cloud provider of choice we’ve heard our customers’ desires for flexibility loud and clear and are proud to soon offer teradata database on azure our industryleading analytics database that is customized specifically for integration with microsoft’s cloud unlike other data warehouse solutions on the market that integrate with azure our product is a true enterprise data warehouse instead of a data mart model available via the azure marketplace our customers that are already familiar with both teradata and azure and are comfortable going the doityourself route can be up and running in about an hour for clients that want some guidance we offer our teradata services team of experts to aid with setup we are keenly attuned to our clients’ demands for this option — a survey of our customers shows that  percent want to consume some of their analytics ”as a service” analytics and data are all that we do and we have set up our business to provide your company that expertise without the headache of going it alone teradata database on azure also lets new customers migrate from a thirdparty database over to teradata our company offers onboarding along with our architecture and database conversion services and we have an optional cloud workshop to enable our customers to learn about their new industryleading choice in data warehouse software adding to teradata database on azure’s focus on flexibility is our payasyougo model which reduces your commitment and risk and our integration with a wide variety of software tools in the azure environment our solution’s massively parallel processing mpp can currently scale between one and  nodes and teradata database on azure can back up to and restore from azure blob storage to ensure easy integration it also features automatic node failure recovery so your system can quickly and efficiently function despite any temporary glitches as many companies shift to cloud solutions that allow for speed and flexibility teradata continues to make teradata everywhere available to a growing array of deployment environments teradata database on azure can help you derive more value in this datadriven world you can use the cloud solution you want while getting the best minds in the business at teradata to fill in the blanks freeing you to focus on the actionable ways your data can make your company excel expect the unexpected real stories of challenges that slow digital transformation december   whether it’s the famous moore’s law or our own sentient enterprise capability maturity model for analytics at scale – there are lots of frameworks for understanding how innovations and breakthroughs build exponentially on one another to fuel rapid digital growth one thing that’s becoming increasingly clear is that analytic solutions must harness and scale innovation at the realtime pace it’s happening sometimes this rapid success creates entirely new challenges of its own i’ve previously advocated failfast strategies for maximum insight recovery and ultimate competitive advantage what i’m talking about here is the “symptom of success” kind of challenges that exist only – and precisely – because some new technological capability made them possible unexpected challenges and gamechanging solutions some of these symptoms of success can be as vivid as they are technical consider an example by way of a senior data executive at a leading car sharing service during his discussion with colleagues at a  industry forum it turns out that – while the company’s piloting of a driverless taxi program in pittsburgh pennsylvania has been a success – the scenario raises new and unsavory issues like “how will the car know to clean itself if an occupant throws up during a ride” fortunately the executive told his panel audience that algorithms don’t have weak stomachs – allowing them to hypothetically leverage environmental sensors and cleaning crew logistics for new solutions to keep you as the next passenger from finding out the hard way that a taxi should have been taken out of service as another example at that same forum i also heard a senior data analytics executive for a major league baseball team talk on the legalities of using players’ health data for competitive advantage analytics now make it possible to align health data with realtime metrics to gauge player fitness fatigue and performance during games but that has created a new conundrum does that valuable health data belong to the team as a team asset or to the player as federallyprotected personal health data under hipaa in this case the executive said the team’s policy was to honor patient privacy while still leveraging less sensitive aggregate data or other input like physical performance evaluations  regardless of the exact remedy that’s the kind of policy question that only becomes possible as new capabilities point the way another symptom of success demand for digital leadership innovation drives capabilities which in turn drive new business or policy problems the previous two examples were fairly narrow to illustrate a point  but let’s take a broader dynamic that is affecting our entire industry – that’s the lack of digital leadership as with other symptoms of success the shortage of digital leadership comes amid tremendous growth in capacity connectivity and bandwidth that’s putting unprecedented big data capabilities within most companies’ reach the challenge – as i’ve often quoted industry analyst tom davenport – is that “you can buy digital capabilities a lot more easily than you can buy digital leadership” “if you don’t address both the physical assets and the business processes you don’t have sustainable change” i was reminded recently by the chief digital officer for a major multinational networking company that’s undergoing a selfdisruption he said success involves innovating as much around your digital operating model as around technology “you should be innovating around rolesresponsibilities innovating around insights competencies behaviors and operational procedures” he said as you drive your organization for real answers from data success requires a constant appetite for change ideally your system’s architecture and design accommodate the prospect of increasing data users queries and demands well beyond those initially identified your model for success is grounded on advanced longrange planning and recognition of the need for consistent scalable growth you can read more of my blogs here  disrupt thyself a point plan for innovation at large enterprises november   clayton christensen’s foundational writings on disruption – how innovation drives new markets in place of old ones – is required reading for anyone in business  so embedded is the concept in fact that the question is no longer how and why disruption happens but who the winners and losers are that’s given rise to a second wave of insight around the mantra to “disrupt or be disrupted” a very large wave indeed judging by the  million search results when you google those words  rather than rehash general arguments why selfdisruption is advisable i’d like to focus on large enterprises – and how even those that are very successful today should be in fullon pursuit of selfdisruption  here are three main points to consider selfdisrupt while you’re still profitable i know a hugely successful networking company with tens of thousands of employees that consistently ranks  or  in every market where they compete still they’re pursuing an aggressive and companywide selfdisruption effort as if their survival depends on it  that’s because it does as this particular enterprise mounts a shift from a hardwareintensive model to a software and consumptionbased focus on recurring revenue they’re racing not against competitors – but against the future needs of their own customers “business models are changing every  months with moore’s law” a top executive at the company explained “our trigger to change was the voice of our customers and the forward visibility they expect us to have when it comes to innovation and how they’ll be consuming it in the future” marathon runners know to hydrate before they get thirsty the same can be said of companies needing to selfdisrupt before they get desperate even then the course can be rough unique workforce challenges arise for instance when trying to advocate preemptive change to employees who may have known nothing but success within the organization selfdisrupt in sustainable ways when you’re a small startup disruption is like intellectual red bull that powers you through a few market cycles you’re agile because you’re small and you can risk a huge crash because – given how percent of startups fail within a few years – long term survival is mostly an abstraction large enterprises with an ecosystem of customers relying on them can’t afford to think this way – but neither can they afford to sit still to thread the needle big companies must foster disruption and entrepreneurialism within the context of sustainable and scalable models in resourcing your own blueprint for sustainable selfdisruption consider the five stage sentient enterprise methodology for enterprise agility also my previous blog post on digital transformation highlights the related point that your digital operating model – how you manage processes people behaviors and competencies – is just as important as the technology itself  the wharton school’s eric clemons meanwhile echoes an “allpervasive” approach to enterprise disruption across the “structure and strategy of the entire business” selfdisrupt in directions your customers need to go unless you’re constantly anticipating tomorrow even today’s biggest successes will always be on borrowed time we need however to make sure our road map into the future is an accurate one for ourselves and our customers this is especially true in analytics where clients may be buying not just a product – but an entire digital environment that their whole business relies on think back to the logic of moore’s law and the reality that corporate timetables for standing up innovation at scale can be  months if it’s only then that we realize we stood up the wrong solution we can spend another two years of unraveling and rebuilding  that whole cycle counts for eons on the technology clock – plenty of time to put yourself and your customers out of business if you make the wrong call especially for companies in a trusted advisor role getting ahead of disruption is a make or break proposition whatever customers think of you now they’ll abandon you – or go out of business along with you – if you’re not there with the right innovations needed for tomorrow   the analytics and leadership mandate for digital transformation october   “digital transformation” is lodged in every corporate and it lexicon today – a “hot term” as idg infoworld executive editor galen gruman explains that’s mentioned far more often than it’s understood so to boost that understanding let’s do a bit of linguistic sleuthing and isolate just the word transformation look it up and you find merriamwebster and other dictionaries offering definitions around “dramatic” “thorough” “major” or “complete” change now we’re onto something use cases of digital transformation demonstrate that success indeed comes only when companies mount a dramatic and thorough or major and complete reimagining of their business – not just it but everything about their organizational activities processes business models and workforce competencies however i don’t think we can fully understand digital transformation until we realize something else the phenomenon is happening everywhere – not just everywhere within a particular company – but everywhere in society across all sectors of the economy and all manner of business enterprises the analytic mandate for digital transformation nowhere was this realization more evident than at a recent “digital revolution summit” on analytics that teradata cosponsored with forbes magazine in the course of just a single day in early october at a conference center outside san francisco our summit hosted a breadth of industries – from transportation and finance to manufacturing major league sports and even city government – as a measure of how virtually no sector remains untouched by digital transformation for the more than  analytics professionals who came to the summit – top data executives from companies like ebay uber wells fargo facebook and american airlines to name a few – the mandate seemed clear our job is to connect the dots identify client needs and bring solutions to market in time to make a difference for a wide range of customers in countless industries and continents so how do we go about it digital capabilities… and digital leadership one major takeaway i’d like to highlight is that digital transformation requires us to spend as much time innovating our processes and operating models as we spend innovating the technology itself as the chief digital officer at one global networking company put it rushing to innovate technology without also innovating underlying governance roles and responsibilities leads to “institutionalizing dysfunction” this is especially important for large enterprises that may support any number of clients in numerous sectors such clients are only as transformational as the digital partners they rely on success as this global networking executive explained requires asking up front questions like “do we have clear alignment on business goals what are the implications of where the business is moving and how is technology going to be the enabler of this” when questions like this go unasked companies can end up with expensive infrastructure built around outmoded business models unfortunately not enough companies today have the csuite acumen to think this way or as industry analyst tom davenport put it in his keynote address “you can buy digital capabilities a lot more easily than you can buy digital leadership” analytic fuel for a global phenomenon taken as a whole our forbes summit laid bare a raft of insights and challenges for the analytics community we saw how analytics can optimize the customer experience how to use algorithms to better scale your business how data analytics is transforming the way city governments govern and grow and – of course – we shared the sentient enterprise capability maturity model which i’ve been advocating for some time to enable agile decisionmaking for even the largest multinational companies on all these fronts our goal is to leverage analytics for a digital transformation that is truly worldwide and allencompassing indeed an oftquoted world economic forum report shows digital transformation is a global juggernaut on track to create  trillion in value over the next decade in developing the analytics that fuel this transformation we don’t just need to think big – we also need to think broadly across all sectors of society borderless analytics taking complexity out of today’s analytical ecosystem september   a rapidly changing and digital world creates a desperate need for more agile datadriven decisionmaking every business needs to move faster with data but if i were to ask you the question “how agile is your business” how would you answer how would you even go about measuring your ability to make faster datadriven decisions one way is by assessing the complexity of your analytical ecosystem this includes all the databases onpremises and in the cloud applications and analytic processes that you currently have in place across the enterprise to deliver insights to your business users typically complex and siloed analytical ecosystems are less agile so assessing complexity can often be used as a surrogate to assess your agility what we’ve found when we do this analysis with our customers is that innovation and adoption of new technologies has created a wild west environment of siloed platforms data and analytics the data is stuck everywhere in multiple public clouds on private clouds and different data centers and within lines of business most of these systems don’t talk to eachother analytic insights are truncated by the unavailability of data and stitching it all together can take months if not years this is completely unacceptable when the world and competitors are moving by at breakneck speeds this is a problem we hear often and it is the one we are solving today with what we call teradata borderless analytics borderless analytics turns hybrid systems into a single analytical ecosystem — it allows seamless shifting of analytic workloads across a multisystem hybrid environment it provides our customers the ability to easily manage multisystem environments and shift workloads to optimize resource utilization at the same time it enables crosstechnology analytics giving users access to heterogeneous analytic processing engines and data stores using the latest teradata technology like querygrid and unity and open source tools like presto we are enabling a true multisystem multilocation analytical environment that can integrate data between different instances of the public cloud managed and private clouds and onpremises as our press release  states this is all about flexibility and agility and “…empowering companies to analyze data where they want when they want and across the data and platforms they need regardless of where they reside” complexity kills agility one of our core missions is to take the complexity out of our customers’ analytical ecosystems we stitch it all together and offer templates and predefined advanced analytics capabilities to stand up a hybrid analytical ecosystem in minutes rather than months or years and grow and expand that analytical ecosystem as needed with assured knowledge that scaling the teradata hybrid environment will not hurt agility querygrid unity open source presto and aster analytics in the cloud all comes together to power borderless analytics borderless analytics allows our customers to use advanced analytical capabilities very quickly across all their data without needing the expertise and time to move data around all analytics is done within our ecosystem the release of teradata querygrid  combined with presto lets us span analytics across different sources of data with teradata unity our customers are able to run multiple instances in sync for extreme high availability in the cloud or across various clouds this is yet another step in our vision of a sentient enterprise that functions as a single analytic organism and reacts to changes in the world as it happens we believe that a less complex enterprise in terms of systems and processes is easier to change and is therefore more agile when you’re asked “how agile is your business” start by assessing complexity the complexity of your processes and the complexity of your analytical ecosystem or talk to teradata we can help you remove complexity to
