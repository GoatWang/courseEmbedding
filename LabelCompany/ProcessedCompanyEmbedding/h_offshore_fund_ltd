seek to achieve superior riskadjusted returns over the business cycle primarily through a differentiated middlemarket distressed investment strategy with an emphasis on publicly traded distressed and eventdriven and postreorganized securities as well as a small allocation to select privately underwritten credit opportunities the manager migrates investments across the capital structure as appropriate to the point in the credit cycle the managers strategy is designed to i maximize returns and minimize risk across credit and business cycles with a constant focus on hedging and risk management ii capture return through yield and event catalysts and occasionally through proprietary loan product in periods of public credit market spread tightness and iii seek total returns at appropriate times in the distressed cycle by investing in and often facilitating the restructuring of distressed securities thereby creating ownership in enterprises at significant discounts to enterprise value the manager implements the partnerships strategy by opportunistically allocating capital within dislocated markets h offshore fund ltd top holdings whalewisdom search all search f
