the first product duchy originals launched was the oaten biscuit and its still a top seller today april fultonfor npr who knew prince charles started one of the first organic and locally sourced food companies in the world over  years ago not us until we got a pitch from his public relations outfit inviting us to entertain like the royals this holiday season with duchy originals from waitrose it turns out the company quietly markets a variety of finelytextured subtle tasting cookies biscuits if youre a brit at specialty stores and online the organic biscuits have only been available in the us since  theyre part of a line of fancy jams cheese eggs meats and vegetables sold exclusively at the highend waitrose grocery stores in the uk two decades ago the heir to the throne of england foresaw the potential and value in organic agriculture prince charles estate farm called the duchy home farm went organic in  at a time when most shoppers cared only about the low price tag on suspiciously blemishfree vegetables and unnaturally large chickens piled high in supermarkets as time magazine describes it the farm supplied barley beets carrots milk mustard oats parsnips and wheat to duchy originals the company the price started in  but going green in the gogo s and s wasnt easy even for a future king with major assets just the process of developing a supply chain for organic sausages and bacon was a major challenge said the prince at a recent st anniversary event for the company back in  there were few guidelines for growing large quantities of food without synthetic pesticides we had to start from scratch – literally and we had to do it by persuading a few courageous producers that it was worth their while to go through the risky and exhaustive process of converting their entire operation to an organic regime prince charles told the audience at the event the first product duchy originals launched was the oaten biscuit and its still a top seller today the cookie is much more refined than it sounds and it hit the spot with tea and cheese when we tried it world prince charles the royal gardener who would have thought that  years later oaten biscuit would have turned into a brand worth  million sold in over  countries with  different lines and most encouragingly would have donated over  million  to charitable causes said the prince at the anniversary gathering much of the money raised this year will go to a future farming project run by the soil association the prince said in his speech of course the prince of wales and his dreams of earthfriendly elegant food have not been without their challenges duchy originals was by all accounts struggling in mids as consumers turned away from buying its luxury products during the economic downturn it teamed up with waitrose in  and came bouncing back this summer prince charles was forced to close the nations poshest greengrocer the veg shed where he sold organic fruits and vegetables from his estates farm

herbal products stir controversy by dan childs close follow on twitter more from dan abc news medical unit march    shares email star abcnews photo illustration  shares email in an unusual twist a prominent uk scientist is accusing prince charles of contributing to the ill health of the nation by backing with his name an herbal detox product that sells for about  per bottle the crown prince is certainly not the first celebrity name to be associated with the worldwide detoxification trend still the concerns expressed by edzard ernst britains top complementary and alternative medicine expert and director of complementary medicine at the peninsula medical school about the royals involvement with the duchy originals product line reached beyond the countrys shores this week the product in question is duchy herbals detox tincture which contains dandelion and artichoke extracts the duchy originals web site suggests that those using the formulation take a few drops of it with water twice a day to help eliminate toxins and aid digestion ernst in his comments to the uk media made clear that he believed the claims were unfounded under the banner of holistic and integrative health care he promotes a quick fix and outright quackery ernst told britains the daily mail newspaper tuesday prince charles and his advisers seem to deliberately ignore science and prefer to rely on makebelieve and superstition ernst could not be reached for further comment meanwhile duchy originals refused to comment on ernsts tirade beyond a statement issued by ceo andrew baker shortly after his comments became public there is no quackery no makebelieve and no superstition in any of the duchy originals herbal tinctures the statement reads we find it unfortunate that professor ernst should chase sensationalist headlines in this way rather than concentrating on accuracy and objectivity baker further noted that the solution is marketed as a food supplement in accordance with all national and local laws and has never been described as a medicine remedy or cure for any disease while the fallout from ernsts comments continues to polarize medical professionals and the public in the uk alternative medicine experts in the united states said that the situation underscores misconceptions that exist about detox in this country as well detox may be getting a bad rap mark blumenthal founder and executive director of the austin texasbased herbal medicine thinktank american botanical council said that part of the thrust behind the detox movement is the idea that the food supply and environment of today expose people to higher levels of chemicals and pollutants than in the past many people  rationally or irrationally correctly or not  believe strongly that they must detoxify their bodies to give themselves that extra edge to get rid of these chemicals he said there is probably a healthy and rational basis for some of this though some people take it a bit too far and dr roberta lee vice chair of the department of integrative medicine at beth israel medical center in new york city said detoxification as a concept may be getting an undeservedly bad rap detoxification is a natural process that occurs in the body though it is not labeled as such in the medical profession she said the idea that detox is a silly notion i think is a fallacy the truth behind detox one thing that is clear about detox however is that it is a lucrative concept in a herbal and nutritional supplement industry that reaps an estimated  billion in sales in the united states each year detox is the new hotbutton term celebrities openly adhere to and advocate a variety of detox diets while treatments that purport to cleanse blood liver and bowels line the shelves of supplement stores throughout the country blumenthal noted though that prince charles may have come about his advocacy of herbal products honestly prince charles and his whole family have been using homeopathy for three generations he said prince charles grew up in a family in which natural medicine was the norm indeed detoxification is far from a new idea blumenthal added that the basic concept of flushing unhealthy substances from the body goes back  years or more and in its purest form lee said it is not an unhealthy proposition detox is no getoutofjailfree card detox is about changing the diet eating good food she said its a matter of how we frame it but blumenthal and lee agreed that all too often people view detox as a getoutofjailfree card for indulgence in unhealthy behaviors and occasionally an illconceived detox plan can be even more unhealthy than the behaviors that spurred it depending on how extreme a detox strategy is there can be risks of that kind of approach blumenthal said citing for instance one wellknown cleanse plan in which an individual consumes nothing but a mixture of water lemon juice and maple syrup for days on end for some people this may be totally contraindicated he said people need to apply these things with common sense and he said this argument may have been what prompted the comments from ernst who incidentally was the  recipient of the american botanical councils norman r farnsworth botanical research award what he is saying here is that the notion that people might be able to detox as an excuse to continue nonhealthy lifestyles is the wrong idea
