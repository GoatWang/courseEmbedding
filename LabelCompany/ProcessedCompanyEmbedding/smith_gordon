you afraid of we ask these six critical questionsand then we ask them againat points of transition in our lives they all lead us to the one core question what is the good work to which i am called gordon t smith author of courage and calling writes it is a good question because our work matters to us to others and of course it matters to god work itself is good it is vital to our human identity and we are most ourselves most who god calls us to be living in what it means to know the salvation of god when we know the grace of work well done however smith acknowledges that this is not a simple question to answer in the midst of our very complicated lives thats why he has written this brief and accessible bookto offer the support and insight we need as we ponder these six core questions in community with god and others as a steward of your life in attentiveness to the calling of god how is god inviting you to engage the world author bio▼▲ gordon t smith phd loyola school of theology

page  of  snickerdoodlesarah gender female  stars out of  could have been better february   snickerdoodlesarah gender female quality  value  meets expectations  usually at least for me when i think of god calling someone to some type of work it is always in the context of some type of official evangelistic type of work such as one being a missionary overseas starting a prison ministry working at a rescue mission teaching a class at church on sundaysetc normally it is always outside of everyday life outside of ones secular profession and outside of ones life at home it is something recognizably spiritual the author of this book has a different perspectiveone that i basically agree with the premise of this book consider your calling by gordon t smith is that the work that god calls christians to do is not just missionary work or heading church ministries but it is also the seemingly secular callings i love the premise of the book i just have some problems with how mr smith tries to teach it first he talks about discovering ourselves discovering what matters to us after first asking what matters to god which is good and i sort of get what he means but something seemed off to me he says things likeit can be so difficult to peel back the layers of pretense and get to the heart of our identity to the deep sense of who we are but we must because wisdom is found here the wise are always those who know god and know the ways of god but the wise are also those who come to the gracious and liberating truth of their own selfidentity  and saying yes to our lives will mean saying no to that which is not us we stop living with living with illusions about who we are or wish we were  and accept the life that has been given to us we embrace it we choose it and we walk with it yes god will often work with our desires and interests but what if he chooses to put us in a vocation which we have no interest mr smith does say that gods calling on our lives will consistently be in light of our actual circumstances and i completely agree with that and appreciate his bringing that up i just wish he would have dealt more with submission to god when we end up in a vocation that we would not have chosen for ourselves that we should try to develop an interest in it and do our work to the best of our ability to gods glory one really may end up in a profession in which one has no interest but doesnt have a plausible way of getting out of it for instance in biblical times i am sure that many if not all servants would not have an innate interest in their vocation if they had an unjust master and perhaps they would rather have done something else but paul tells them servants be in subjection to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward for this is acceptable if for conscience toward god a man endureth griefs suffering wrongfullype  asv perhaps they were slaves or bondservants and didnt have a choice as to their profession but if they were a christian they already had their true identity given to them by christ they didnt have to analyze their own interests their interests were given to them by god in his word and thus they knew how they were to act in their profession the above brings me to another point that i think mr smith should have dealt with our identity in christ  that type of selfdiscovery is more important to discover first than the selfdiscovery mr smith was talking about that is something that i do not remember him dealing with the new people we are in christ defined by gods wordthough he does talk about us aspiring to deeper fellowship and identification with christ i just dont remember him focusing on the fact that as christians we are new creationspeople in christ  cor  that that is something that we need to come to grips with first of all by reading gods word which tells us who we are and what attributes we are to be pursuing humility and counting others as more important than ourselves philippians  selfcontrol patience love joy submitting to authoritiesbosses that god has placed over us romans  titus etc giving thanks in every circumstance renewing our minds dying to selfand on so on the bible is the best place to start for discovering our identity if we realize who we are in christ and how we are best pleasing to our true master then we are ready for any profession god assigns to us another thing that i didnt like was that smith seems to think that the religious orders of various monks benedictines franciscansand so on were legitimate works for god but from what i understand most monks were imposing sacrificial works upon themselves to earn some type of favor with god for salvation or grace rather than working from salvationgrace that god had already given they worked for it and that type of work is heretical as the salvationgrace of god is not of human works it is not earned by us at all and lastly he is a bit too open to liturgy for my taste he encourages signing oneself with the sign of the cross before going about our work and there is also a prayer at the end of the book that one can use in corporate worship he defines worship as the liturgy of the gathered people of god  but isnt true worship obedience serving god and submitting to his will in everything i think he missed another great starting point there instead of talking about how we are to participate in gods work by being like him in being creative and working along with gods plan to redeem people he could have instead defined worship and obedienceour work for the lordsubmission to him and thus have come from the standpoint of we dont only worship on sundays or at official church gatherings we can worship every single day every hour by our submission to his will and by our obedience to his word and thus we can work at secular occupations and be worshiping god yes we want to participate in the work of god though i might have some trouble with how smith described i in the book but our participation is not just a privilege it is worship i must say though that i heartily agree with this statement the author makes we are participants in the grand narrative the work of the creator and redeemer it is not in the end all about what we are up to but rather what god is up to all in all though i loved the point of the book i think that mr smith missed some key starting points for the basis christian service ill end with my favorite quote from the book where the author is encouraging people to recognize gods sovereignty in their livesin their occupations our vocations are always for such a time as this  esther  our vocations are always for this time and this place always we always embrace the good work to which we are called in response to actual circumstances challenges and opportunities no one is ahead of their time no one missed their time further this means that vocation is not generic by which i mean that we do not fill out a form about ourselves and our interests and strengths and then turn to the back of the book to see if we are to be an engineer artist or preachers rather our vocations are always received and responded to in light of the actual situations in which we find ourselves and typically these are circumstances over which we may have very little control we have been placed here in this time and place and now we need to navigate our way through what lies before us what must be stressed is that wise women and men refuse to think of themselves as victims of their circumstances but rather as those who have been providentially situated  before god and in the grace of god  and will respond with courage creativity and patience to what is at hand many thanks to the folks at intervarsity press for sending me a complimentary review copy of this
