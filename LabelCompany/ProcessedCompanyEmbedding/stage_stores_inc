contact us login search search how safe is stage stores inc stock the stock could be a dividend trap jeremy bowman tmfhobo mar   at pm the best way to understand stage stores nysessi may be to look at the stocks recent performance  ssi data by ycharts over the last five years shares have fallen  while the broadmarket sp  has gained  and the spdr sp retail etf has jumped  the disparity only increases when shortening the window to  in other words the current picture for stage stores stock is not a pretty one the stock sits at a fiveyear low and the company has badly missed earnings estimates in its last three quarters what gives the company seems to have the misfortune of operating in a struggling industry  department store retail  and owns stores in oilrich parts of the country that have been affected by the slide in oil prices in its recent earnings report ceo michael glazer said our holiday results were pressured by low oil prices the devalued peso and record warm temperatures stores in the oil patch and along the mexican border account for more than  of our sales and the economic uncertainty in those areas negatively affected our comp sales by  basis points during the fourth quarter source stagestorescom the houstonbased company is particularly vulnerable to oil sector weakness as comparable sales fell  in the quarter and  in the year leading to substantial declines in profit for the year free cash flow was also  million another warning sign as the company invests in its ecommerce platform and improving store appearance like many of its rivals the company plans to close  stores over the summer stage said it would shutter  of its  stores and plans to close  stores this year while opening none it forecast a decline in comparable sales of  to  for the current year and flat profit growth so how safe is itthe best reason for investing in stage is probably its  dividend yield a product of managements aggressive capital return policy which also included repurchasing  million in stock or approximately  of the companys market cap in the fourth quarter while such a move will boost the companys pershare earnings the business is not generating the cash flow necessary to pay for such a buyback nor can it sustain the  dividend payout purely out of cash flow at its current profitability level if its performance continues to decline the dividend could get cut or scrapped altogether making stage stock especially risky with a track record of missed earnings estimates and declining comparable sales and its correlation with oil prices the stock cannot be considered safe if oil prices turn around shares could rebound but otherwise its outlook seems bleak the department store industry is struggling with the emergence of fast fashion and ecommerce and the currency and commodity conditions that have weighed on stage seem unlikely to change in the near future therefore investors seeking a safe investment should look somewhere else a better bet in the department store industry may be jc penney nysejcp the onceailing chain is on its way back to profitability and posting strong comparable sales growth the company has also beaten estimates solidly for the last four quarters and thats a trend you want to get behind  the past year has seen stages shares shed more than  of their value and its clear why for investors looking for safety that should be a red flag   jeremy bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned try any of our foolish

between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results
