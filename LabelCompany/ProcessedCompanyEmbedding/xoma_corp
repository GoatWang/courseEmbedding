xoma corporation nasdaqxoma  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»xoma another ligand in the makingjul  about xoma corporation xoma biotech phoenix longshort equity special situations biotech healthcaresummaryover its  year history xoma corp has experimented with different business models to leverage it’s core monoclonal antibody technologiesafter a failed attempt at internal rd management has restructured and significantly cut spendinga new strategy looks to reduce risk while unlocking value from future milestones and royalties on a portfolio of  programs in developmentligand pharmaceuticals initiated a similar strategy in  and has seen the stock price increase more than  fold since a valuation of the current portfolio and recent investment from biotech value fund suggest that the market is significantly undervaluing xoma’s assetswhat is xoma’s new strategy and how did it get here xoma xoma has a  year history as a biotech company focused on technologies to design therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to understand xoma’s new strategy we first need to understand the company’s evolution summary of xomas strategy evolution early strategy xoma’s initial business model was to develop technologies to identify and design antibodies and related therapeutic proteins and then outlicense the technology to various biotech and pharmaceutical companies these biopharma companies would use xoma’s technology to design new antibodies that they would then develop themselves in return xoma would receive milestones and royalties on future sales from this several successful products were launched including blockbusters drugs like lucentis® and cimzia® this strategy had the benefits of being relatively low cost and low risk but limited potential upside in the event that a product was successful recent strategy in the early ’s xoma decided to change it’s strategy and focus on investing in internally developing own antibodies the hope was that by successfully developing their own drugs they could build a commercial infrastructure and become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company during this time xoma formed research collaborations with companies like scheringplough now merck chiron now novartis and servier to collaborate on developing new antibody drugs the benefit of this strategy was the ability to capture more of the financial upside if a drug was successful the downside was a significant increase in rd costs and bearing the risk if a product failed to be successful this strategy appeared to be promising until gevokizumab a servierpartnered treatment for the ocular disorder behçets disease missed its main goal in a phase  trial in mid  this news sent the stock price into decline from nearly  per share split adjusted to below  by early  future strategy after the gevokizumab failed trial the falling stock price and market cap prevented xoma from raising significant amounts of capital needed to continue the prior strategy of investing in latestage rd projects as a result management devised a new “backtobasics” strategy this new strategy cut costs significantly by eliminating nearly all rd spend and refocused on outlicensing remaining products and technology to other companies who will fund future product development the benefits of this strategy are less risk from a highly diversified portfolio low expenses from virtually no rd investment while still maintaining some future upside through milestones and royalties if the products are successful i believe this is a potentially attractive model for investors who are looking to invest in biotech but who can’t stomach the risk of seeing their stock lose  of its value overnight is there precedence for other companies that have successfully utilized this type of strategy yes ligand pharmaceuticals lgnd has been quite successful implementing the same strategy prior to a major restructuring in  ligand was a full integrated pharma company with both internal rd and a fully owned commercially marketed product in early  ligand transformed into a royalty focused company after it sold off it’s sole marketed product cut  of its workforce and refocused rd from late stage product development to new technology platforms since then they have increased the number of milestone and royalty bearing externally funded rd programs from  in  to  today in addition ligand has generated consistent sales growth and been cash flow positive since  more importantly ligand shareholders have been rewarded handsomely as the stock price has appreciated more than  fold since  so what assets does xoma have xoma’s current assets fall into two main categories fully funded licensed programs products from previously outlicensed and being actively developed by other companies programs available for licensing products developed from xoma rd activities that are available to be outlicensed for development by other companies  fully funded licensed programs over  years xoma has outlicensed its antibody technologies to many leading biopharmaceutical companies including novartis takeda alexion lilly ucb morphosys affitech aveo and many others from this xoma currently has a portfolio of  programs that are being actively developed by external companies xomas fully funded program pipeline source xoma the development costs for all of these programs are being  funded by external partners at no cost to xoma xoma meanwhile is entitled to receive future milestone and royalties on future sales if these programs are successful  programs available for licensing from its foray into internal rd xoma also has the following portfolio of  internally developed products xomas program pipeline available for licensing source xoma xoma has largely completed rd investment in these programs and is now looking for external partners to take on funding their future development in return they will likely receive a combination of upfront payments along with future milestones and royalties similar to the programs in  above what are xoma’s assets potentially worth to estimate the present expected value of xoma’s product portfolios i’ve attempted to model probability adjusted estimates the value of the future cash flows for all key projects to keep the exercise “simple” i’ve modeled all programs using the following basic assumptions based on the product’s current stage of development note probabilities are for biologics from tufts center published in march  assumptions for each stage of program advancement assumptions from each stage to launch i then applied these assumptions to both the fully funded pipeline and programs available for outlicensing  fully funded licensed programs for all fully funded pipeline products i also assumed peak sales of  million with a  royalty to xoma lasting  years after launch to be conservative i’ve only modeled out existing programs and assumed no new additions to the pipeline royalties applying the years to launch assumptions i estimated the annual royalty payment by for a program at each stage of development second i applied the historical probability of launch to calculate the estimated royalty payment for each program by stage of development third i multiplied the probability adjusted royalty payment by the current number of programs to get the expected value of royalties for the portfolio estimated cash flows from funded program royalties milestones i applied the potential milestone payments based on expected timing and multiplied by the number of potential milestones to calculate the potential milestone payments by year next i applied the probability of each milestone occurring to calculate the probability adjusted milestone payments estimated cash flows from funded program milestones combined royalties and milestones finally i added the probability adjusted values of both the royalties and milestone payments and applied a  discount rate estimated cash flows from funded program royalties and milestones this results in a stand alone probability adjusted present value of the funded pipeline at  million  programs available for licensing to estimate the potential value of each of the programs available for licensing in phase  of development i applied the same methodology as above i used this approach because these programs each have potential for range of different applications with potential for both broad and niche applications therefore i assumed the same peak sales of  million but with a higher royalty rate of  typical of a later stage product in addition i assume milestone payments of  million upfront  million on phase  and  million on approval overall i believe this is inline with potential for outlicensed asset with phase  proof of concept data estimated cash flows from phase  program to be outlicensed applying a  discount rate implies that the three phase  programs if successfully outlicensed could be worth roughly  million each  integrated pl to account for both taxes and operating expenses i combined the cash flows from the fully funded pipeline and conservatively assumed that only two of the three phase  programs were successfully outlicensed further i assumed  million a year in operating expenses based on company guidance and a  tax rate that does not account for use of potential net operating losses applying a  discount rate to the projected cash flows yields an present value of just over  million assuming full future conversion of  million bvf shares in addition to the  million outstanding implies a price per share of approximately  compared to the current price just above  a share why is the market putting a high discount on xoma’s assets i believe that there are several reasons as follows  collateral damage from gevokizumab failure the news of gevokizumab’s phase  failure created a number of issues for xoma first it set the stock price into free fall this depressed the market cap making it increasingly difficult to raise capital to reverse the decline required new rd but new rd required more money which required a higher stock price this dilemma was further compounded by the fact that xoma also had significant debt that also needed to be repaid this drew into question the viability of the business and set the stock price into a spiraling downtrend  changing investor base with new strategy xoma’s prior strategy to focus on internal rd with visions of transforming into a fully integrated pharma company as demonstrated by the failure of gevokizumab was a high risk venture high risk biotech companies that risk losing  of their value overnight attracts a certain type of high riskhigh reward investor xoma’s shift to a new low risklow reward strategy is in general less attractive to it’s existing base on high risk investors as a result i believe this has further encouraged existing investors to sell meanwhile it takes time for new investors to realize the new strategy and transition to a new investor base long time followers of ligand will recall a similar experience where the change in strategy wasn’t initially well received by investors either prior to announcing the new strategy in jan  ligand was stock trading in the mid’s and by the end of the year it was in the ’s and didn’t reach its bottom until  when it was trading below   lack of transparency around outlicensed products i believe that another key issue holding back xoma’s stock price results from an unintended lack of transparency with investors many of the original outlicensing deals that have generated most the xoma’s current portfolio have confidentially clauses that prevent xoma from disclosing the individual program names or potential milestonesroyalties this makes it difficult for the company to generate excitement with investors who have little visibility into what is really in the portfolio to illustrate this point how much would you pay for a company with an undisclosed phase  program compared to if you knew the phase  program was alexion’s followon to their multibillion dollar drug solaris what’s the reason to believe in this mystery portfolio in february  biotech venture fund bvf made a significant  mm investment in xoma that included  shares of common stock at the closing price of  and series x convertible preferred stock that converts at  into  shares of common stock conversion of the preferred is barred if conversion brings total ownership above  this gives bvf an active holding of  of common and passive  ownership via the preferred stock it is my understanding that prior to making such a large investment bvf was able to conduct extensive due diligence that included a full disclosure of xoma’s entire portfolio it is my belief that bvf clearly liked what they saw given the combined of size and favorable terms of their investment what are the risks  timing and dilution applying historical probabilities of success to xoma’s funded portfolio suggests a high probability of successfully getting one or more products to market i estimate that  of the current  programs are “expected” make it to market based on published historical probabilities of success estimated number funded programs expected to launch the key risk is that you don’t know how long it will take until a product hits for example it could be within a year or it could be many years out xoma management expects  million in milestone payments over the next three years that with existing cash should help cover most of the  million a year in operating expenses in the near term however if near breakeven cash flows fail to materialize it would require the need to raise additional capital that could further depress the stock price in addition the company still maintains  million in debt through an outstanding loan from novartis  liquidity with a market cap of just over  million and low trading volume of a few thousand shares per day xoma stock price has the potential to be highly volatile conclusion xoma has taken painful steps after the failure of gevokizumab to set the company on a new course focused on a low costlow risk strategy of royalties and milestones from outsourced rd programs a similar strategy implemented by ligand pharmaceuticals has proven to be highly lucrative for shareholders i believe this change in strategy along with challenges from lack of visibility into the pipeline have significantly depressed the stock price relative to it’s fair value a recent major investment from biotech value fund

phoenix longshort equity special situations biotech healthcaresummaryover its  year history xoma corp has experimented with different business models to leverage it’s core monoclonal antibody technologiesafter a failed attempt at internal rd management has restructured and significantly cut spendinga new strategy looks to reduce risk while unlocking value from future milestones and royalties on a portfolio of  programs in developmentligand pharmaceuticals initiated a similar strategy in  and has seen the stock price increase more than  fold since a valuation of the current portfolio and recent investment from biotech value fund suggest that the market is significantly undervaluing xoma’s assetswhat is xoma’s new strategy and how did it get here xoma xoma has a  year history as a biotech company focused on technologies to design therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to understand xoma’s new strategy we first need to understand the company’s evolution summary of xomas strategy evolution early strategy xoma’s initial business model was to develop technologies to identify and design antibodies and related therapeutic proteins and then outlicense the technology to various biotech and pharmaceutical companies these biopharma companies would use xoma’s technology to design new antibodies that they would then develop themselves in return xoma would receive milestones and royalties on future sales from this several successful products were launched including blockbusters drugs like lucentis® and cimzia® this strategy had the benefits of being relatively low cost and low risk but limited potential upside in the event that a product was successful recent strategy in the early ’s xoma decided to change it’s strategy and focus on investing in internally developing own antibodies the hope was that by successfully developing their own drugs they could build a commercial infrastructure and become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company during this time xoma formed research collaborations with companies like scheringplough now merck chiron now novartis and servier to collaborate on developing new antibody drugs the benefit of this strategy was the ability to capture more of the financial upside if a drug was successful the downside was a significant increase in rd costs and bearing the risk if a product failed to be successful this strategy appeared to be promising until gevokizumab a servierpartnered treatment for the ocular disorder behçets disease missed its main goal in a phase  trial in mid  this news sent the stock price into decline from nearly  per share split adjusted to below  by early  future strategy after the gevokizumab failed trial the falling stock price and market cap prevented xoma from raising significant amounts of capital needed to continue the prior strategy of investing in latestage rd projects as a result management devised a new “backtobasics” strategy this new strategy cut costs significantly by eliminating nearly all rd spend and refocused on outlicensing remaining products and technology to other companies who will fund future product development the benefits of this strategy are less risk from a highly diversified portfolio low expenses from virtually no rd investment while still maintaining some future upside through milestones and royalties if the products are successful i believe this is a potentially attractive model for investors who are looking to invest in biotech but who can’t stomach the risk of seeing their stock lose  of its value overnight is there precedence for other companies that have successfully utilized this type of strategy yes ligand pharmaceuticals lgnd has been quite successful implementing the same strategy prior to a major restructuring in  ligand was a full integrated pharma company with both internal rd and a fully owned commercially marketed product in early  ligand transformed into a royalty focused company after it sold off it’s sole marketed product cut  of its workforce and refocused rd from late stage product development to new technology platforms since then they have increased the number of milestone and royalty bearing externally funded rd programs from  in  to  today in addition ligand has generated consistent sales growth and been cash flow positive since  more importantly ligand shareholders have been rewarded handsomely as the stock price has appreciated more than  fold since  so what assets does xoma have xoma’s current assets fall into two main categories fully funded licensed programs products from previously outlicensed and being actively developed by other companies programs available for licensing products developed from xoma rd activities that are available to be outlicensed for development by other companies  fully funded licensed programs over  years xoma has outlicensed its antibody technologies to many leading biopharmaceutical companies including novartis takeda alexion lilly ucb morphosys affitech aveo and many others from this xoma currently has a portfolio of  programs that are being actively developed by external companies xomas fully funded program pipeline source xoma the development costs for all of these programs are being  funded by external partners at no cost to xoma xoma meanwhile is entitled to receive future milestone and royalties on future sales if these programs are successful  programs available for licensing from its foray into internal rd xoma also has the following portfolio of  internally developed products xomas program pipeline available for licensing source xoma xoma has largely completed rd investment in these programs and is now looking for external partners to take on funding their future development in return they will likely receive a combination of upfront payments along with future milestones and royalties similar to the programs in  above what are xoma’s assets potentially worth to estimate the present expected value of xoma’s product portfolios i’ve attempted to model probability adjusted estimates the value of the future cash flows for all key projects to keep the exercise “simple” i’ve modeled all programs using the following basic assumptions based on the product’s current stage of development note probabilities are for biologics from tufts center published in march  assumptions for each stage of program advancement assumptions from each stage to launch i then applied these assumptions to both the fully funded pipeline and programs available for outlicensing  fully funded licensed programs for all fully funded pipeline products i also assumed peak sales of  million with a  royalty to xoma lasting  years after launch to be conservative i’ve only modeled out existing programs and assumed no new additions to the pipeline royalties applying the years to launch assumptions i estimated the annual royalty payment by for a program at each stage of development second i applied the historical probability of launch to calculate the estimated royalty payment for each program by stage of development third i multiplied the probability adjusted royalty payment by the current number of programs to get the expected value of royalties for the portfolio estimated cash flows from funded program royalties milestones i applied the potential milestone payments based on expected timing and multiplied by the number of potential milestones to calculate the potential milestone payments by year next i applied the probability of each milestone occurring to calculate the probability adjusted milestone payments estimated cash flows from funded program milestones combined royalties and milestones finally i added the probability adjusted values of both the royalties and milestone payments and applied a  discount rate estimated cash flows from funded program royalties and milestones this results in a stand alone probability adjusted present value of the funded pipeline at  million  programs available for licensing to estimate the potential value of each of the programs available for licensing in phase  of development i applied the same methodology as above i used this approach because these programs each have potential for range of different applications with potential for both broad and niche applications therefore i assumed the same peak sales of  million but with a higher royalty rate of  typical of a later stage product in addition i assume milestone payments of  million upfront  million on phase  and  million on approval overall i believe this is inline with potential for outlicensed asset with phase  proof of concept data estimated cash flows from phase  program to be outlicensed applying a  discount rate implies that the three phase  programs if successfully outlicensed could be worth roughly  million each  integrated pl to account for both taxes and operating expenses i combined the cash flows from the fully funded pipeline and conservatively assumed that only two of the three phase  programs were successfully outlicensed further i assumed  million a year in operating expenses based on company guidance and a  tax rate that does not account for use of potential net operating losses applying a  discount rate to the projected cash flows yields an present value of just over  million assuming full future conversion of  million bvf shares in addition to the  million outstanding implies a price per share of approximately  compared to the current price just above  a share why is the market putting a high discount on xoma’s assets i believe that there are several reasons as follows  collateral damage from gevokizumab failure the news of gevokizumab’s phase  failure created a number of issues for xoma first it set the stock price into free fall this depressed the market cap making it increasingly difficult to raise capital to reverse the decline required new rd but new rd required more money which required a higher stock price this dilemma was further compounded by the fact that xoma also had significant debt that also needed to be repaid this drew into question the viability of the business and set the stock price into a spiraling downtrend  changing investor base with new strategy xoma’s prior strategy to focus on internal rd with visions of transforming into a fully integrated pharma company as demonstrated by the failure of gevokizumab was a high risk venture high risk biotech companies that risk losing  of their value overnight attracts a certain type of high riskhigh reward investor xoma’s shift to a new low risklow reward strategy is in general less attractive to it’s existing base on high risk investors as a result i believe this has further encouraged existing investors to sell meanwhile it takes time for new investors to realize the new strategy and transition to a new investor base long time followers of ligand will recall a similar experience where the change in strategy wasn’t initially well received by investors either prior to announcing the new strategy in jan  ligand was stock trading in the mid’s and by the end of the year it was in the ’s and didn’t reach its bottom until  when it was trading below   lack of transparency around outlicensed products i believe that another key issue holding back xoma’s stock price results from an unintended lack of transparency with investors many of the original outlicensing deals that have generated most the xoma’s current portfolio have confidentially clauses that prevent xoma from disclosing the individual program names or potential milestonesroyalties this makes it difficult for the company to generate excitement with investors who have little visibility into what is really in the portfolio to illustrate this point how much would you pay for a company with an undisclosed phase  program compared to if you knew the phase  program was alexion’s followon to their multibillion dollar drug solaris what’s the reason to believe in this mystery portfolio in february  biotech venture fund bvf made a significant  mm investment in xoma that included  shares of common stock at the closing price of  and series x convertible preferred stock that converts at  into  shares of common stock conversion of the preferred is barred if conversion brings total ownership above  this gives bvf an active holding of  of common and passive  ownership via the preferred stock it is my understanding that prior to making such a large investment bvf was able to conduct extensive due diligence that included a full disclosure of xoma’s entire portfolio it is my belief that bvf clearly liked what they saw given the combined of size and favorable terms of their investment what are the risks  timing and dilution applying historical probabilities of success to xoma’s funded portfolio suggests a high probability of successfully getting one or more products to market i estimate that  of the current  programs are “expected” make it to market based on published historical probabilities of success estimated number funded programs expected to launch the key risk is that you don’t know how long it will take until a product hits for example it could be within a year or it could be many years out xoma management expects  million in milestone payments over the next three years that with existing cash should help cover most of the  million a year in operating expenses in the near term however if near breakeven cash flows fail to materialize it would require the need to raise additional capital that could further depress the stock price in addition the company still maintains  million in debt through an outstanding loan from novartis  liquidity with a market cap of just over  million and low trading volume of a few thousand shares per day xoma stock price has the potential to be highly volatile conclusion xoma has taken painful steps after the failure of gevokizumab to set the company on a new course focused on a low costlow risk strategy of royalties and milestones from outsourced rd programs a similar strategy implemented by ligand pharmaceuticals has proven to be highly lucrative for shareholders i believe this change in strategy along with challenges from lack of visibility into the pipeline have significantly depressed the stock price relative to it’s fair value a recent major investment from biotech value fund supports this thesis disclosure i amwe are long xoma i wrote this article myself and it expresses my own opinions i am not receiving compensation for it other
