loss and hope tag archives dan l batrack nov   who is pulling blm’s strings on public land usage guest editorial by debbie coffey resource management plans for your land how does the un monsanto mining and oil  gas companies get their hands into bureau of land management blm resource management plans and environmental assessments to dictate the use of our public lands and our future well i found one way  i noticed that two companies tetra tech and environmental management  planning solutions inc empsi are preparing blm and forest service resource management plans rmps environmental impact statements eiss environmental assessments eas and other reports  so what do we pay blm employees to do just look pretty in their uniforms     tetra tech it’s not some small environmental company  tetra tech has  employees in  offices around the world  tetra tech owns about  other companies  and makes billions of dollars in annual revenues  they work with developers nuclear power energy mining and minerals processing etc  on the tetra tech website it declares “our mission to be the premier worldwide consulting engineering and construction firm” tetra tech even bought prointelligent  an international security and intelligence consulting firm used by the us state department  so they seem to have their hands in everything the most troubling aspect about tetra tech preparing the plans for the blm can be seen by looking at tetra tech’s board of the directors  hugh m grant is the chairman president and ceo of monsanto on tetra tech’s website this fact was omitted in his bio  why would monsanto’s ceo be on the board of an engineering and construction company j kenneth johnson is a director of alaska air group which owns coeur d’ alene mines corp  and pioneer natural resources co oil and gas exploration  he’s president of pacific star energy llc and managing director of alaska venture capital group a private oil and gas exploration firm  he was also an arco bp executive  albert smith was an exec vp at lockheed martin and worked for the cia j christopher lewis cofounded riordan lewis  haden and is on the board of secure mission solutions  riordan lewis  haden has investments in tetra tech and secure mission solutions patrick haden was a partner in riordan lewis  haden and director of tcw strategies income fund and the tcw funds  and usc’s athletic director richard h truly is director of xcel energy inc and is on the board of the colorado school of mines dan l batrack has a vague bio batrack “has served in numerous capacities over the last  years including project scientist project manager operations manager senior vice president and president of an operating unit  he has managed complex programs for many small and fortune  clients both in theunited states and internationally” there seems to be possibilities for conflicts of interest  and also a possibility to exert some control over land water and resources tetra tech has been contracted by the blm to help the blm winnemucca nevada office with their rmp  which is interesting because within the winnemucca blm district is the rochester mine owned by couer d’alene mines which tetra tech board member j kenneth johnson may have an interest in since he’s on the board of directors of the company that owns couer d’alene mines in tetra tech’s sec filings it states that in regard to revenues it received  from department of defense agencies  from usaid and  from otherusfederal government agencies it also claims that international business grew  in the third quarter of fiscal  and that they expected international business to grow significantly in fiscal  and continue strong demand for their services in the mining and energy markets worldwide in  they also acquired a mining engineering company in australia which they expected to “enhance” their “technical expertise in the mining and minerals processing sector” and expand service in australia and “serve as a gateway to new markets across asia and africa” sounds like they’re in the mining business to me  could they be creating “gateways” here in the usa to increase their business if tetra tech owns or has clients who own energy and mining companies and they are preparing or helping to prepare the rmps eiss and eas it seems like they might be tempted to cut themselves a good deal tetra tech rtw mining services provides heap leach facility design tailings facility design tailings delivery systems and mining process fluid management    if they’re “providing” tailing delivery systems to mines isn’t this “selling” this to mining companies  and unless they’re providing their services for free their business depends on mining  most businesses want to keep their customers happy and think of ways to make more money tetra tech has some interesting connections in the oil and gas industry  they bought halliburton’s subsidiaries brown  root environmental and halliburton nus nuclear utilities service corp in  tetra tech ec designed and constructed more than  nuclear power facilities from  through   it’s a good thing tetra tech also does remediation  they could potentially clean up at both ends of the deal environmental management  planning solutions inc empsi the blm battle mountain district office nevada awarded a  million contract to environmental management planning solutions inc to prepare a resource management plan rmp “to guide development and conservation on  million acres of federal land within lander county eureka county nye county and esmeralda county nevada” empsi was part of the “outreach core team” to implement programmatic environmental impact statements eiss to facilitate geothermal development on “federal” lands throughout the western us  it seems empsi wasis also doing geothermal permit development support for “confidential clients” in nevada  so they’re preparing a resource management plan for development and conservation which may mean just saving assets for their clients on the one hand then on the other hand they’re helping confidential clients get their permits who owns empsi  it’s a private company and it’s hard to find out much about it  it seems that key employees of empsi have also worked for tetra tech  that includes john e king the “principal” of empsi who has been at empsi since   before that he was at tetra tech from  and was a vice president  empsi lists tetra tech as a “client” empsi was incorporated in delaware in  so it’s impressive that a company that is only about  years old again it’s hard to find the history of this company even on its website has clients including about  us government agencies including the departments of defense interior agriculture states cities banks and major energy companies empsi even assisted solyndra in getting a department of energy loan guarantee the un connection if you look at the services on empsi’s website  you see terms like socioeconomic  environmental justice visual resource management and sustainable development  these terms probably weren’t in us environmental assessments  years ago socioeconomic justice also called “equity” is communism      if you look on the un’s website specifically about sustainable development in the usa and note in the heading on the link that this is agenda   be sure to take note of a sentence in the first paragraph “in the absence of a multisectoral consensus on how to achieve sustainable development in the united states the pcsd was conceived to formulate recommendations for the implementation of agenda ” pcsd is the us president’s council on sustainable development you’ll also see the subtitle “integrated” decision making  un’s agenda  is what is being integrated and implemented in the usa sidestepping congress and the constitution  read agenda     there are chapters about “changing consumptive patterns” and “promoting sustainable human settlement development” this means moving you out of rural areas and into stack and pack apartments in cities and “integrating environment and development into decisionmaking” this includes decisionmaking like rmps eiss and eas both tetra tech and empsi have us agencies as “clients”  us agencies that are members of the un’s iucn are us departments of state commerce agriculture forest service the interior fish and wildlife service and the national park service and the environmental protection agency epa  these agencies are also on the rural council  on the iucn website it states “iucn links its mission to the paramount goals of the international community on environment and sustainable development in particular agenda …”   agenda  expert cassandra anderson of wwwmorphcitycom states that agenda  is the united nations’ action plan tetra tech “participates” in iucn’s dcmc dc marine community  the world bank is on the advisory board  tetra tech implemented a usaid funded a project  the forest carbon markets and communities fcmc program led by scott hajost chief of party  hajost is a member of the iucnus board and has served on iucn commissions on law and ecosystems  hajost was senior counsel to the center for international environmental law ciel for two years  he was writing the un laws to be integrated and implemented resource mangement plans rmps are a big deal because a lot of blm plans for “multiple uses” are based on rmps for  or  years  an rmp as described on the blm website “will be to establish guidance objectives policies and management actions for public lands” and addresses air quality cultural resources soil and water resources vegetation lands and realty management wildlife habitat and fisheries management mineral and mining resources recreation and ohv use visual resource management special management designations hazardous materials other issues i guess with the “other issues” the rmp covers everything rmps eiss and eas give the green light to certain “multiple uses” on our public lands like expanding mining or a freeforall on the oil and gas lease sales of our public lands for as little as  an acre or take away things that were on our public lands like removing our wild horses to make room for other uses tetra tech received a  million contract from the epa for a pollution prevention program and  a  million contract from state department us aid for a climate change program  looking at the larger picture what really seems to be on the horizon in terms of “change” is the loss pf  our democracy and active participation in  “prevention” of private land ownership  sources
