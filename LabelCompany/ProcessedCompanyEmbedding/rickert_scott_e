president nanofilm ltd httpinvestingbusinessweekcomresearchstocksprivatepersonasppersonidprivcapidpreviouscapidprevioustitlenanofilmltd httpwwwnanofilmtechnologycomaboutnanofilmbioscotthtm dr rickert is one of nanofilms original founders he was responsible for the original concepts that launched nanofilm into the nanotechnology arena dr rickert was instrumental in the development of the companys first coating called clarity and continues to set the vision for the company dr rickert brings a depth of research expertise to the company from his strong academic background he was a professor at case western reserve university from  to  he holds a bs from cornell university and a phd from case western reserve university he currently holds positions on a number of key industry groups including the global advisory board of the nanobusiness alliance dr rickert frequently lectures and writes on topics in the field dr rickert really enjoys developing technical and distribution partnerships which allows new nanofilm formulas to be created that are both very valuable and widely distributed  scott rickert founder president and ceo nanofilm ltd by tom jackson  am august   nanofilm ltd founder scott rickert  says there are two ways to develop a nanotechnology company  the cleveland way and everyone elses way the cleveland way or more appropriately the northeast ohio way mr rickert says is to develop a product immediately to produce cash flow and make a company viable in the marketplace the other way is to rely on grants he said there are very few periods of time in nanofilms history that we have lost money mr rickert said proudly he is nanofilm s president and ceo based in valley view nanofilm specializes in placing thin coatings on glass and optical surfaces its first products were coatings to keep eyeglasses clean and help them to resist scratches more recently nanofilm has expanded into coatings to protect the windshields of cars and boats one of its products the clarity defender prevents splattered bugs and substances such as rain and bird droppings from clinging to windshields hightech magazines such as wired have noticed it and it sells on amazon for about  the company is working hard to get the product on store shelves a task that is more important to him than developing new products right now our focus here has to be on getting people aware of the products and their value mr rickert said to aid those efforts the company hired john swett a former employee of the fibers additives and rubber division of bayer corp in akron to aid with nanofilms marketing mr swett said he is working to get national retail chains and automotive supply stores to carry clarity defender mr swett said he was attracted to work at nanofilm by mr rickerts track record somebody who has a profitable business in the nanotechnology business speaks for itself he said it is very exciting to come to work every day mr swett said a possible source of new product development for nanofilm will be films to protect the displays on devices such as cell phones and personal digital assistants people rely upon such devices and they dont want to look at scratchedup dirty screens people are going to want to see those problems go away mr swett said sales in the first quarter of  were strong mr rickert said he declined to release figures but said sales were across the board very high in optical and automotive products nanofilm is in a good stage in its life to grow he said mr rickert was a professor at case western reserve university about  years ago when he decided to leave and start his own company most of my colleagues thought i was crazy especially since i had just gotten tenure he said but he had made up his mind that if he didnt start the company no one would know if his technology for covering surfaces with very thin films could be turned into a commercial product i think thats the big thing if i didnt do it nobody was going to do it he said nanofilm has about  employees that number has been steady for about the last two years but mr rickert contends theres no relationship between success and the number of people you have it bothers mr rickert that many people worry about job numbers in northeast ohio in other areas of the country such as silicon valley the measure of success is whether new companies are being created he said i dont know anywhere else that focuses on job count as a measure of success he said scott rickert photo credit marc golub printed from httpwwwcrainsclevelandcomappspbcsdllarticleaidtemplateprintart  seven
