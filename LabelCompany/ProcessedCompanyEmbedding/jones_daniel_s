marketing magicfortune editorsdec  how the tennessee whiskey in the square bottle became a global megabrand without losing its smalltown authenticityformerly the head of procter  gamble’s  billion advertising operation jim stengel  the ultimate marketing guru  is bringing a new message to the masses in his upcoming book grow how ideals power growth and profit at the world’s greatest companies stengel in conjunction with millward brown optimor and the ucla anderson school of management identifies  brands that outperformed the competition in this exclusive excerpt stengel shows how brands with ideals like delivering unrelentingly highquality whiskey are more recognizable  and profitable  in the long run fortune  the character of jack daniel’s the whiskey with the iconic blackandwhite label on the equally iconic square bottle is inextricably bound up in the distinctive character of jack daniel the brand’s founder and first master distiller a physically diminutive man only  feet  inches tall jack daniel devoted his outsize personality to the ideal of making a whiskey that thanks to charcoal filtering and other factors he could be proud to sell and others could be proud to drink  at a premium pricefrom the start jack daniel grew his business through astute brand leadership he had lots of competitors around lynchburg tenn in distilling whiskey that was filtered through charcoal he wanted his whiskey to be and represent something special so he used only the ironfree cave spring water on his property and the finest grains mellowed his whiskey by filtering it through  feet of sugar maple charcoal and changed the charcoal out more often to produce a more consistent and better whiskey jack liked to say “every day we make it we’ll make it the best we can”relatedconstellation brandswall street isn’t sold on rumored coronajack daniel’s dealconstellation brandswall street isn’t sold on rumored coronajack daniel’s dealbefore his death in  jack daniel passed his whiskey business along to his nephew lem motlow who had long worked for him lem found a way against the odds to innovate by staying true to the ideal established by his uncle he not only used the same distillation process and kept the square bottle but also resurrected jack daniel’s after prohibition which was much longer in tennessee  than in the us as a whole  even after  many counties in tennessee remained dryafter lem motlow died in  his children increased sales with the brand’s first national advertising and then sold the business in  to familycontrolled brownforman as the best way to maintain heritage and quality while expanding under brownforman’s ownership and with the continuing involvement of motlow family members jack daniel’s has seen a series of brilliant innovations that have preserved and extended the richness of its brand experience while never veering off its hallowed idealuntil the s sales of jack daniel’s grew almost entirely through word of mouth boosted by occasional media attention and intermittent regional ads in  fortune published an article on jack daniel’s that chronicled its growth and its appeal to such disparate figures as the  nobel prize winner william faulkner british prime minister winston churchill and hollywood director john huston whose movie the african queen was then a big hit a similar  article in true one of the most popular magazines of its day put even greater emphasis on its being the favorite drink of entertainment celebrities such as frank sinatra jackie gleason and ava gardner sinatra called jack daniel’s “nectar of the gods” and he sometimes wore a blazer with a patch for an imaginary “jack daniel’s country club”interestingly jack daniel’s began to advertise regularly at a time demand already exceeded supply from the mids to the s the company sold its product on allocation “the sales representatives would literally go into an establishment and let them know how many bottles or cases they could have” explains brand historian nelson eddyadds eddy “when other companies would pull back from advertising jack daniel’s advertised more those ads carried the message ‘we’d rather ask for your patience than your forgiveness’ they spent money on ads to tell people they couldn’t get it what they essentially said is that like jack daniel and lem motlow before them they’re not going to compromise the quality of the product to meet demand so customers can be assured that when they do get some it’s going to be the one and only jack daniel’s”the approach followed a  onepage marketing plan drafted at the behest of art hancock the brand’s first marketing director and winton smith its first national sales director who envisioned a future based on the heritage that jack daniel and lem motlow defined the onepage plan eddy says “codified jack daniel’s as authentic made by real people in an outoftheway place” their ads are distinctive not only for what they say but also for what they show evoking a premium brand experience that is unique in the marketplaceeddy notes that “if you look at liquor ads of the period they’re typically fullpage fullcolor with a big beautiful bottle shot and a man in a smoking jacket or posed by an expensive car something that says luxury well here comes this brand running smallerspace ads with blackandwhite photography of these people in lynchburg tenn who aren’t in smoking jackets they’re in the work clothes they wear every day to make the whiskey” of jim stengels greatest brandsthis counterintuitive approach to marketing a premium brand  the onepage marketing plan included avoiding discounting the price  ran into skeptics along the way who did not understand the universal values it evoked “going into the united kingdom in the early s” eddy says “there was pushback about small blackandwhite ads showing people in lynchburg tenn they said ‘that works in the united states but it won’t work here’ guess what it did” today britain is the secondstrongest market for jack daniel’swhile this decision now looks easy and smart in retrospect i am sure it was gutwrenching i worked on dozens of global brands at pg pg where this discussion happened in every new country as we expanded there is a constant tension between the ideal of the brand and the drive to make the brand more local more in tune with countryspecific habits practices and culture like other top businesses i’ve studied in depth jack daniel’s has a “brand ideal” that is authentic to its heritage enthusiasm for that ideal will likely resonate wherever a company takes its businesswhen jack daniel’s went on allocation in the mids the distillery began to receive letters from people asking when and where they might be able to buy jack daniel’s in their communities jack daniel’s sales and marketing staff wrote back in a friendly way about how sorry they were to disappoint them and how much they valued their love of the whiskey they wished they could make more but they couldn’t because it would hurt qualitythe brand made a positive out of having to go on allocation but it didn’t want to frustrate large numbers of customers permanently the challenge was to increase supply of an artisanmade product and to maintain the founder’s values in the late s brownforman tore down the existing distillery and built bigger facilities on the same site while the distillery employees continued to go about their work in the open air walking on temporary wooden catwalks built around the stillrelatedpepsicopepsi fire mixes cinnamon and snapchatpepsicopepsi fire mixes cinnamon and snapchatthe result immediately made its decadesold supplyconstrained business model obsolete jack daniel’s grew into a global brand almost tripling sales from  to  to support this growth jack daniel’s invested more in its archetypal lynchburgfocused advertising which had continued to resonate with consumers it also began to engage in an active way with popular culture through sponsorships the now famous jack daniel’s barbecue competition dates back to the s in  jack daniel’s became a continuing sponsor of professional bull riders this relationship fit the jack daniel’s persona of the maverick authentic individual exceptionally well because the now very successful professional bull riders tour had been formed only three years earlier by  bull riders who split off from the professional rodeo cowboys associationjack daniel’s has grown with much less product proliferation than most brands jack daniel’s old no  remains by far the largest part of their global business guided by their ideal jack daniel’s management has introduced new products over the years to keep their brand and their ideal relevant every new product emanates from the ideal and most are actually derivatives of the special whiskey from lynchburgin the s jack daniel’s introduced gentleman jack a smoother softer whiskey  thanks to being charcoalfiltered twice  and the first new whiskey from the distillery in  years in  jack daniel’s successfully introduced single barrel select the equivalent of a singlemalt scotch whiskey the late s brought two major initiatives jack daniel’s country cocktails a range of malt beverages and the global expansion of a variety of readytodrink cocktails that contain jack daniel’s and cola diet cola or ginger ale in  jack daniel’s introduced jack daniel’s tennessee honey whiskeytennessee honey is one of the boldest new initiatives from jack daniel’s over the past  years and one of the riskiest but if you want to dominate in any new category you have to dominate customers’ entry into it jack daniel’s has long been the dominant favorite of young people entering the whiskey category but young whiskey drinkers’ tastes are evolving and the flavored whiskey category is growing fast “you need to ask ‘how would jack launch a flavor’ ” recalls kris sirchio brownforman’s chief marketing officerthe inspiration for the positioning came from arnold worldwide jack daniel’s ad agency they captured it in the phrase “a little bit of honey a whole lot of jack” the product while flavored had to be distinctive authenticas jack daniel’s has grown from a us brand to a global one so the jack daniel’s marketing team has grown from a small number of people to a global marketing organization to ensure that employees around the world understand the brand experience from the inside jack daniel’s brings them to lynchburg in small groups for an experience it calls camp jack over several days the participants learn the legend and lore of jack daniel’s up close including a day working in the distillerythe goal of camp jack is to ensure that everyone who attends it can understand the absolute authenticity of the brand kris sirchio tells me that one of the most special parts of camp jack is the bestowal of nicknames on the participants in a ceremony on barbecue hill site of the annual jack daniel’s invitational barbecue contest nicknames are a symbol of friendship an abbreviated story and as it turns out they’re part of the lore of the jack daniel’s brand after all jack daniel’s full and proper name was jasper newton daniel but his friends nicknamed him “jack” how fortunate  can you imagine keith richards drinking “jasper daniel’s”from the book grow how ideals power growth and profit at the worlds greatest companies
