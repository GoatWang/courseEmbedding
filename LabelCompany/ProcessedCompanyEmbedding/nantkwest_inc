positioned in rapidly growing markets with high medical needs about nantkwest nasdaq nk is a pioneering next generation clinicalstage immunotherapy company focused on harnessing the unique power of our immune system using natural killer nk cells to treat cancer infectious diseases and inflammatory diseases nk cells are the body’s first line of defense due to the innate ability of nk cells to rapidly identify and destroy cells under stress such as cancer or virallyinfected cells nantkwest’s unique nk cell based platform with the capacity to grow active killer cells as a biological cancer therapy has been designed to induce cell death against cancer or infected cells by three different modes of action  direct killing using activated nk cells ank that release toxic granules directly into the cell through cell to cell contact  antibodymediated killing using hanks which are nk cells engineered to incorporate a high affinity receptor that binds to an administered antibody enhancing the cancer cell killing effect of that antibody and  targetactivated killing using tanks which are nk cells engineered to incorporate chimeric antigen receptors cars to target tumorspecific antigens found on the surface of cancer cells our ank hank® and tank™ platform addresses certain limitations of tcell therapies including the reduction of risk of serious “cytokine storms” as an “offtheshelf” therapy nantkwest’s nk cells do not rely on a patient’s own often compromised immune system in phase  clinical trials in patients with late stage cancer nantkwest’s nk cells has been successfully administered as an outpatient infusion therapy without any reported severe side effects even at doses of  billion cells by leveraging an integrated and extensive genomics and transcriptomics discovery and development engine together with a pipeline of multiple clinicalstage immunooncology programs that include a phase  trial for a rare form of melanoma and the planned initiation of a clinical trial
