co estée lauder cos and williamssonoma which she joined in  bravo blazed a trail in the retail industry during the s and ‘s she held a number of positions at rh macy  co culminating as chairman and ceo of subsidiary i magnin from  to  her success there helped her land the job as president of luxury retailer saks fifth avenue with responsibility for merchandising marketing and product development then in  she became ceo of burberry where she oversaw a bold reform of the british classic brand expanding the line of products and boosting sales and profits in the process her vast experience and success in retail is precisely the reason bravo sits on as many boards as she does we talked about how to excel on a board about women in leadership and of course about retail after all and she’ll bristle at this moniker bravo is something like the queen of luxury retail the nice thing however is that she doesn’t act like it her commitment to hard work showed during our taping as much as any executive interviewed for our leadership series bravo wanted to get things right no matter the time it took it helped that she was camera friendly—with a ready smile plenty of wits and that good ol’ bronxneighborhood charm for a glimpse of rose marie bravo’s views on leadership watch the video interview by clicking the video box or read the transcript that follows an edited transcript chapter   a ceo and her board – leveraging the relationship to make better leaders roger crockett  how can the board help the ceo be successful and how can the board help in the development of high potential management rose marie bravo  well a board can be immensely valuable if a ceo and management team know how to use the board  the board members are there to add value and on the boards that i have been on and that i have observed there’s a great deal of expertise around the table on various subjects  so you have a variety of expertise and it’s up to the ceo and the chairman to be the sort of band leader and to figure out how to utilize the best of the talents that they have around that table roger crockett  okay  well give me a couple of examples  i know that on some of your boards you said there had been programs and panels put in place  talk a little bit about those rose marie bravo  most recently i’ve been involved with williamssonoma’s leadership team and they asked two or three of the board members to meet with them to talk about our successes and yes our failures  we were asked what are some of the things we learned as we were running companies what are some of the things we wanted to pass on to new leaders and what we thought was important in a leader  we have a wonderful program at estée lauder called semper novus and it means ‘always new’ leonard lauder our chairman emeritus believes that one executive must always be learning  everything has to always be new because the business we’re in is forever changing and is transformational  so his mantra is “how do we keep the executive team always learning and exploring the nuances of all the various aspects of the business that one is involved in”  so he has a program that is run by phoebe port whereby they bring in executives from all around the world and they invite board members to attend just because they believe so much in leadership  i think it’s a wonderful program chapter  “adding value as a director takes more time than it used to” roger crockett  now that makes it obvious that the time commitment required from a board member is much different today than it was maybe a few years ago  talk a bit about how much time is required and why it’s changing in corporate america rose marie bravo  i’ve seen the board meetings themselves really evolve and they’ve stretched in most cases now to almost two full days when you get done with the committees and the executive sessions  some of it is due to the good governance practices that we have to deal with so time is needed to follow up on some of the regulations to make sure that we are doing all the things we are supposed to be doing  then you have the actual business of the business  in a couple of these cases estée lauder and williamssonoma the companies own multiple brands so even getting a board to be familiar with all the different brands in terms of presentations that takes up a lot more time at a company like tiffany that is burgeoning in asia and other places around the world you have all of a sudden international issues that maybe ten years ago didn’t exist  now in almost every board meeting you have a session on china the importance of china as a market the importance of the chinese consumer the importance of the chinese consumer who travels into duty free outlets the importance of chinese consumers in europe – whether shopping in paris shopping in london or shopping in berlin  this has changed the whole complexity of learning for the board to keep them up to speed  now we’re asking the board to add value on some of the experiences they might have with some of these international markets  also technology has changed everything for us roger crockett  how so rose marie bravo  so now you have ecommerce now you have pinterest now you have twitter meetings facebook meetings and you’re talking now about social media as another major topic which if you go back even five years didn’t exist  so i think it’s more complex it takes more time  and i find that the board materials you get in advance which maybe years ago came in a smaller books now come in a big stack but of course they are all on the ipad  you have material that has to be read  you have to take time  if you have a question about the material you have to take the time to inquire about that  then you have the board meeting itself  then you have the post meeting because the meeting itself raises questions and issues that you might want to think about you might want to mull over sleep over and think ‘well maybe this was a good idea maybe it wasn’t but what do they mean by this’  ‘i want to call soandso to ask about this’ chapter  onthejob education for sitting ceos roger crockett  rose marie why is it important for ceos to be on an outside board rose marie bravo  when i first became ceo of burberry i was asked to sit on the tiffany board and i thought to myself ‘oh i am not going to want to do this and my board isn’t going to let me do this because i am just going to be too busy just having taken this new role’  my very foresighted chairman said to me “you absolutely should do this  this is a wonderful opportunity you will learn immensely and it will add value to what you’re doing at burberry”  he was so right  that was in  and it helped me immensely because i was able to almost have a front seat watching a company go international watching a company develop an ecommerce site from a catalogue business watching how they developed their licensee arrangements with various categories of product arrangements with franchise partners in places like the middle east and russia that were difficult to do business with on your own at that time  so it gave me a window into a world as a new ceo  i felt like i was learning and probably they were giving me more value than i was giving them at that time  but it was a wonderful learning experience chapter  “knowing when to zip it and when to weigh in” roger crockett  well talk about what it takes to be a good director a good board member rose marie bravo   you have to be interested in the business and in the company that you’re involved with  and i think in short order you figure out where can you add value  you try to say “how is my experience relevant to that particular business and given who else is there where can i add value” and i think being on a board sometimes means knowing when to zip it and also knowing when you can contribute  you may be the authority on a particular subject versus maybe other subjects where you have a point of view but you may not be as informed as somebody else i mentioned estée lauder and their incredible leadership program and fabrizio freda’s  mantra he calls it ‘leading from every chair’  he’s come up with this little cheat sheet he talks about things like thinking strategically engaging the team in the vision embracing change developing talent energizing others building collaborative relationships demonstrating agility driving creativity and innovation striving for excellence and having high touch leadership competencies  i thought ‘what a great little bible for a board member’ because all of these are areas that we as board members are supposed to care about talent strategy vision the plan and approving the plan and of course following good governance  but beyond all of that these are really things that are additive to a company management team if a board member is really engaged in some of these very important points chapter  take full advantage of the nonexecutive chairman roger crockett  you mentioned estée lauder estée lauder has a person who is the ceo and another person who is the nonexecutive chairman  that is becoming more of a trend splitting those roles  what is important about splitting or not splitting those roles rose marie bravo  that was a very new concept to me when i became the ceo of burberry because in the uk it is mandatory to have a chairman and a ceo they split the roles all public companies have the split role  split roles was unheard of in my experience but i found it to be excellent for me  it worked for me very well  i had two different chairmen during my nineyear tenure with burberry both of whom were very different who had very different skills and both of whom were extremely additive to the value equation at the company  i think it’s like any other thing a good ceo does you think about how to utilize the resources that are available to you i always looked at even though i was reporting to the chairman i always looked at the chairman as working for me  how can i use this chairman this person with so much expertise in fields and areas that i really may not be as knowledgeable about  in both cases they were male and i found that i developed this concept of delegating upwards because there were areas that i felt that “gosh i don’t have time to do some of this other work”  it could be working with the city  it could be reviewing investor relations conversations my second chairman there was an expert john peace in dealing with the city because he had been a ceo of a ftse  company so he knew the ins and outs of the city i figured out that my value added was more in the product and the merchandising and the marketing  if i could spend my time doing that and he helped me in an additive way running the board doing so many other roles that he was able to do for me i was going to be more effective  i think one of the things you hit upon earlier roger is how complex it is today to be a ceo  there isn’t a day that goes by that there is not another article in the newspaper about a ceo wanting to get out being thrown out staying too long or adding different roles  every day it’s like the big topic  you ask yourself why it’s become so much more complex than it was say five ten fifteen years ago  having this dual role i think is meaningful and especially if the personalities conjive  you mentioned estée lauder with william lauder as chairman you had fabrizio freda as ceo their assets their strengths very much compensate for one another  they are able to go on to different subjects  i am now watching at williamssonoma adrian bellamy who’s the chairman and laura alber who is the ceo  the learnings for her include having a chairman who’s been a ceo of a global company and was a chairman of gucci group before that this is a lot of experience and expertise that’s brought to the table  i think a wise ceo can just take advantage of all that knowledge chapter  “ceos in retail today need to eat their wheaties” roger crockett  the environment for retail especially has changed so dramatically over the years  how has that affected the competencies needed for ceos to manage well rose marie bravo  i think ceos in retail really have to take their wheaties because you’re  now  the retail landscape is so competitive  when i think back to when i was beginning my career in retail at macy’s versus the complexity of what you deal with now—from amazoncom to target to saks fifth avenue to designer boutiques—you’re getting competition from every part of the world i think that has added complexity to the business and to the landscape  of course a part of the whole ecommerce conversation in those companies like williamssonoma and tiffany was that they had catalogue businesses  i think it was easier for them to go into ecommerce than maybe somebody like burberry that didn’t have a catalogue business at that time  we didn’t even have mail order  we didn’t even have warehousing for mail order and for catalogue so people like estée lauder that had some catalogue business they were able then to transform that into ecommerce  certainly williamssonoma was a great example of going very easily into ecommerce and now directtoconsumer represents a big part of their total business  i think it added to the complexity of what a role of the ceo is in today’s world roger crockett  does that necessarily mean though that the ceo must bring to the table experience in digital media and social media in technology or can they just have fundamental management skills rose marie bravo  i think you need fundamental good management skills first and you need good leadership skills that we talked about earlier  i think that you’re going to want expertise for sure in ecommerce and social media whether you get from your board whether it’s from the head of marketing or you actually bring somebody on board as williamssonoma has just done by bringing the head of marketing from google onto their board to get that technology knowhow  there’s different ways around it  i think to think that one ceo one human being is going to be able to possess everything that is necessary to be a great retail ceo is a fallacy i think it’s about building the team and having a strong cfo and coo  in the case of the dual leadership roles the chairman and splitting the roles of ceo i come from the merchant line i come from the product line so i think for a retail ceo not to have been immersed in merchandising product stores that’s hard  i am not saying it’s impossible but i think today you want somebody that knows your product because after all nothing happens in retail until a customer buys something so you need to have some understanding of the product and what it’s about and how to drive that dream that you’re selling chapter  required expertise in the board room and the csuite roger crockett  well you mention the board – is there a new profile for a good board or good director rose marie bravo  i think that a lot of the nominating committees that i sit on really spend a lot of time developing the areas of expertise that one must have on the board  at estée lauder one of the things they felt passionately about particularly the nominating committee and lynn de rothschild was that we needed to have asian representation she went very far to find wei christianson who came on to the board from china she was living in shanghai and believe it or not was able to make the commitment of attending the board meetings  so that’s been invaluable  but it depends on the board  i mentioned williamssonoma  they absolutely wanted to have somebody come on from ecommerce  they felt they needed social media and more understanding in ecommerce  so they have the google person tiffany just brought on robert singer who’s coming from many experiences but he was the coo and cfo of gucci that was a case where it was felt that we needed more luxury experience  i think boards and probably nominating committees are spending a lot of time scrutinizing the backgrounds of what they have who may be getting close to retirement who’s going to be going off the board and then what are the talents that we want to bring into the company  i think at the top of everyone’s list of course is international experience  people are craving that  not just on boards but even for executive talent  having lived elsewhere having lived in another part of the country having lived in another part of the world this is the big asset  i would say to young people who are in the process of building their career that if they get an opportunity to move to relocate to live in another part of the world even another part of the country i would grab it  i would grab it because i think having that is a very important asset to have in your bag of tricks chapter  women boards and good leadership roger crockett  estée lauder has done a tremendous job in terms of having a number of women on its board but other companies haven’t done as good as job  how do we get more women in leadership roles in corporate america rose marie bravo i’m so glad you mentioned estée lauder of course the company was founded by a woman and had women such as carol phillips in probably almost half their brands actually running billions of dollars worth of businesses individually as mini ceos  i think they were always a company that sort of understood it and from leonard on down i think you’ve had this feeling of supporting women so when it came to the board and when leonard was taking the company public and creating a board he made sure this whole idea of balance on the board and diversity was present in every way  today we have more women on the board than we do men  we employ women in more than  of the staff around the world women running countries women in legal counsel women in hr women in communications  i think that the whole world is going this way and understanding that there is a connection between the products they are selling and who the end consumer is and what the management of the company is and what the board reflects i do think that with this next generation we’re going to see a giant leap forward in terms of many women especially in our country getting to that ceo corner office  it means making some sacrifices–and this is for males or females anybody  a person has to realize that stepping into that next level it means they have to make sacrifices related posts roger crockett is a thought leadership advisor veteran writer and a speaker on business leadership and

a vision today you have to know where you want to go and what to do to get there its all about the compass the next  years what the picture of the future will look like  years from now reverse engineering is what we have to do its all about determining the future and then reverse reverse engineering makes it happen  ms bravo noted that they both share an italian heritage where family is key she started talking about the idea of family values and how important that element is in business ff yes my italian experience teaches you to lead and it has helped in making things happen italy is very challenging you know the song new york new york and the line if you can make it here you can make it anywhere well i think if you can make it in napoli you can make it anywhere this got a lot of laughs and having traveled to naples where mr freda was born i understand exactly what he means   ms bravo spoke of the famed lauder family and their amazing values ff yes i value that the lauder family is a bluechip family they are passionate and have an obsession with quality leonard lauder always reminds us my name is on the door this got laughs as well family companies are investing in the future and are much more for the long term theres an obsession for the long term  then ms bravo who is a board member of estee lauder recalls her first encounter with mr freda at a board meeting that was held at vassar college they shared memories and laughs about the cozy coed dorm  like living situation   ff meeting the board members in shorts is a challenging moment he joked can you imagine that the first time meeting my board members it  was early in the morning and i was wearing shorts  he recalled seeing vassars motto which was emblazoned in front of the school semper novis which means always new and related how that held a lot of symbolism for his company its something that must always be kept in the minds of those who work in a company but the wisdom and challenge for the leader of a company is to have the wisdom to decide what to change and what to accept and that is a key point for management   ms bravo recalled that challenge when she first took over as ceo of burberry quickly turning the iconic british company into a global fashion mega brand at burberry i was labeled a workaholic how do you balance your life and encourage balance in the workplace ff the key secret take care of your health get good nutrition and manage your energy at some point we have to take a break from work and take care of our selves take your time organize your day and take your holidays i separate work time from family and holiday time rb what about the importance of ethnic and gender diversity ff diversity is the strength its important to create teams that collaborate and to leverage strength we work together and collaborate to create winning teams so we can win building on strength is important rmb how do you manage creative talent and how does that lead to innovation ff  creativity is the sparkle of everything creativity is in everything and it is the key we need to put creativity in the center of everything we do inspiring creativity is the most important thing you need to identify and to know the biggest opportunities and focus your attention on that you have to create something the consumer doesnt know they want but subsequently cannot live without  rmb a good merchant went with their guts in the old days i didnt have a vision for burberry until i got there how important is branding and luxury ff the world of luxury and branding is key image building at the top is key we are selling experiences and entertainment and not just a product rmb what is a great leader ff to be a great leader is all about having a vision leonard lauder once said if you cannot see your future you will never get here and you will never lead if you dont see it invent it thats the definition of a good leader and you have to inspire the others to get there the leaders today have to set the vision and serve the organization and inspire leadership rmb its not lost on me that the new tagline at estee lauder is be an inspiration  what is the future of beauty the world has changed ff beauty is the most exciting market of the future women are becoming wealthier and have more money to spend their three important things are food fashion and beauty rmb what is the best advice you ever got ff the best advise i ever got from william lauder dont give me any solutions right away just listen understand and then create rmb my biggest failure in business is that i couldnt turn around imagnin which i knew had so much potential no what matter what i did i learned a lot from that experience ff i always tell my people you have the right to fail but i always say fail fast and fail cheap this got a lot of laughs at the end members of the audience were invited to ask questions and someone inquired what are your goals for estee lauder   ff to keep it a high growth company we are and want to continue to be the fastest growing company focused on prestige cosmetics   we want to bring prestige super high quality products   offer aspirational brands and   provide high tech services when a man observed that proctor  gamble mr fredas former company has not been doing that well in the past few years  mr freda quipped thats because im not there anymore   marilyn kirschner

beauty plus  up and comers and how they influence what we buy and wear share tweet the power list  rose marie bravo by kristina zimbalistmonday feb   chris shipman for time turning plaid into profits that rose marie bravo recently finished reading jane austens persuasion  a fact she announces with an impassioned oh from her sofa on the th floor of the new york city offices of burberry  is fitting she has engaged in a grandscale persuasion of her own of late that is widely considered a retail marvel since being named chief executive of the british design house seven years ago she has convinced the style elite that the dormant yearold brand  with its placid beige plaid which had been spotted if it was noticed at all lining the raincoats on markdown racks  not only is no longer a fashion anathema but is in fact a status symbol her feat has more than doubled the companys sales turning it from a  millionayear enterprise to a  billion behemoth i didnt quite know until i got there what i was going to uncover says bravo  it didnt take long to see that underneath the debris there was this beautiful quality heritage of course part of it was that the timing was right to restore people were interested in it the checks are now vaunted on ball gowns bikinis and stilettos there are fragrance and childrens lines and sexy ad campaigns featuring chic brits kate moss and stella tennant the iconic trench coat first designed in  by thomas burberry as an army officers raincoat today comes in a panoply of styles colors and prints including this seasons floral she dubs the transformation doing what gucci did at burberry but bravo was displaying corporationaltering prescience and chutzpah long before tom ford made them fashionable as president of saks in the s she brought labels like gucci jil sander and prada onto the selling floor a move that began the stores return to the luxury league of neiman marcus and bergdorf goodman as a cosmetics buyer at macys in the early s bravo noted the sudden proliferation of fuchsia in fashion she called carol phillips cofounder and then head of clinique i said this pink is wildly popular its everywhere in the clothing we dont have a lipstick that color bravo recalls phillips called back to say a new lipstick would be in the line immediately bravo says her biggest break came in  when macys promoted her from senior vice president of merchandising to chairman and chief executive of its new acquisition the californiabased chain i magnin if part of her intrepidity comes from growing up the daughter of a hairdresser who owned a salon in new york citys bronx  bravo attended the elite public bronx high school of science and fordham university also in the bronx  the rest may result from the fact that early in her career she saw women in action says bravo in cosmetics which is where i particularly grew up we had these wonderful role models estée lauder helena rubinstein and elizabeth arden are all women who created companies cliniques phillips hired all women bravo says her top lieutenants were female if youve been given this road map and you see that others have gone before you and achieved you never
