deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us if the underwriter exercises its option to subscribe for additional ordinary shares in full we estimate that the net proceeds will be approximately  million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows  approximately  million to cover the total anticipated remaining costs to advance our microlens and our microlens inserter through our us staged pivotal clinical trial  approximately  million to fund our efforts to expand the number of highvolume refractive laser centers with which we do business  approximately  million to fund research and development and  approximately  million to pursue regulatory approvals that we require in the united states and internationally this calculation of net proceeds does not include  of offering costs that we have expensed in our combined statement of operations for the nine months ended september   due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical trial and regulatory approval process it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering the amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including the success of our clinical trials the timing of regulatory submissions and the amount of cash generated by our international sales pending the use of the proceeds from this offering as described above we intend to invest the net proceeds in shortterm interestbearing investmentgrade securities or government securities the medical device industry in general and the ophthalmic medical device market in particular are highly competitive subject to rapid technological change and significantly affected by new product introductions and market activities of other participants our currently marketed products are and any future products we commercialize will be subject to intense competition we expect to compete against companies that are developing corneal inlay surgical solutions for presbyopia including acufocus inc revision optics inc neoptics ag and lensgen inc acufocus inc’s corneal inlay approach attempts to use small aperture optics to reduce distortion by eliminating peripheral light rays and limiting the width of diverging light rays revision optics inc’s corneal inlay approach attempts to produce a smooth variation in focal power across the pupil by microscopically altering the surface shape of the cornea neoptics ag’s corneal inlay approach consists of a bifocal lens with a peripheral zone designed to improve near vision and a central zone for distance vision lensgen inc is a newer company with little publicly available information regarding its intraocular lens which is being designed to harness fluidics and displacement to manipulate curvature to better capture light both acufocus inc and revision optics inc have been conducting clinical trials in the united states for years and have more experience than presbia in conducting such trials acufocus inc has completed a pivotal clinical trial in the united states and is thus further along in the fda approval process than presbia also both acufocus inc and revision optics inc like presbia have marketing approval in certain jurisdictions outside the united states including the eea and can be expected to compete with presbia in such jurisdictions we believe that acufocus inc may have more commercial activities to date than presbia in certain jurisdictions including japan we do not believe that neoptics ag has approval in the us to conduct clinical trials or marketing approval in any jurisdiction in addition to being an effective treatment option for presbyopia we believe that our microlens is less invasive than revision’s optics inc’s corneal inlay offers a range of optical power corrections not offered by revision’s optics inc’s corneal inlay or acufocus inc’s corneal inlay is less conspicuous than acufocus inc’s corneal inlay and is more easily removable than revision optics inc’s corneal inlay in june  the fda released data presented by acufocus to the fda in its pma submission with respect to its kamra device the data related to a study conducted by acufocus with respect to  subjects of which the fda determined that there were  evaluable subjects we reviewed that data against the data that we compiled from the postmarket surveillance study that we conducted in italy and greece in  with respect to  patients who underwent implantation of our microlens we note the following with respect to the acufocus study and our postmarket surveillance study  approximately  of acufocus’  evaluable subjects achieved ucvanear of  or better in the operated eye  months postoperative which was the primary efficacy endpoint of the acufocus study as discussed elsewhere in this prospectus approximately  of the  patients in presbia’s post market surveillance study achieved ucvanear of  or better in the operated eye  months postoperative  both the kamra in acufocus’ study and presbia’s microlens in presbia’s postmarket surveillance study generally had minimal effect on a subject’s binocular distance vision  included among the adverse events in each study at  months postoperative  of subjects experienced device explantations in acufocus’ study and  of subjects experienced device explantations in presbia’s postmarket surveillance study we believe that this comparative information may be useful to potential investors in assessing our competitive landscape however we note that acufocus’ study includes a substantially larger sample size number of patients that received the implant than presbia’s postmarketing evaluation and that comparability of the results of acufocus’ study and presbia’s postmarketing evaluation could also be adversely affected by differences in patient demographics such as gender and ethnicity as well as differences in study protocols site location and other conditions we also note that we are currently conducting our us staged pivotal clinical trial and that trial might provide different results than those observed in our postmarket evaluation described above and elsewhere in this prospectus we expect to compete against companies that offer alternative surgical treatment methodologies including monovision multifocal and accommodating approaches and companies that promote reading glasses andor contact lenses as approaches for responding to presbyopia at any time our known competitors and other potential market entrants may develop new devices or treatment alternatives that may compete directly with our products in addition they may gain a market advantage by developing and patenting competitive products or processes earlier than we can or by obtaining regulatory approvalsclearances or market registrations more rapidly than we can certain of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater financial technical marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the development regulatory approval promotion sale and support of their products our competitors may also have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships than we do including relationships with our potential customers in addition many of these companies have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we do because of the size of the presbyopia market and the high growth profile of that market we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include  improved outcomes for patients and other product quality issues  product innovation  acceptance by ophthalmic surgeons  ease of use and reliability  regulatory status and speed to market  product price and procedure price and  reputation for technical leadership we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors in regard to any one or all of these factors company description we are an ophthalmic device company that has developed and is currently marketing a proprietary optical lens implant for treating presbyopia the agerelated loss of the ability to focus on near objects our lens which we refer to as our microlens is a miniature lens designed to be surgically implanted in a patient’s eye to improve that patient’s ability to see objects at close distances our current strategy is to continue to commercialize our microlens in certain strategic countries where we currently have marketing approval and to continue to seek to obtain marketing approval in other key markets including the united states our goal is to become a leading provider of corneal inlay presbyopiacorrecting treatment worldwide according to market scope’s  comprehensive report on the global presbyopia surgery market or the market scope report presbyopia is a common vision disorder that affects approximately  billion people worldwide presbyopia is associated with the inability of the eye’s natural lens to change shape or accommodate in order to see clearly objects in the near and middle distance ranges according to the market scope report the worldwide presbyopic population is expected to grow to approximately  billion by  and  billion by  according to the market scope report spending on devices equipment and procedure fees for presbyopiacorrecting surgery is expected to increase from approximately  million in  to approximately  billion in  at the manufacturer level we do not have marketing approval in many jurisdictions included in the foregoing global data which jurisdictions collectively represent a majority of the worldwide presbyopic population we have marketing approval in a number of strategic countries that we are targeting for commercialization and we are actively seeking marketing approval in certain other strategic countries that we are targeting for commercialization including the united states while reading glasses and contact lenses have historically been and remain the most common solution for presbyopia there are significant drawbacks associated with these approaches as well as with alternative surgical approaches we believe that our microlens provides an alternative solution to those presbyopic individuals who desire greater freedom from glasses and wish to avoid the daily maintenance and other complications of contact lenses in addition we believe that ophthalmologists are generally reluctant to recommend a laser insitu keratomileusis or lasik procedure or lens replacement procedure whereby the natural lens is replaced with an intraocular lens or iol implant as a solution for plano presbyopes or those individuals who suffer from presbyopia but do not have any other visual disorder given the inherent risks and visual compromises of such procedures plano presbyopes represent approximately  of the presbyopic population making plano presbyopes the largest subgroup of presbyopes because our solution does not involve the removal of the natural lens the reshaping of the cornea or the removal of corneal tissue we believe that ophthalmologists may be more likely to recommend our microlens as a solution for plano presbyopes than a lasik or iol procedure in addition to being an effective standalone treatment for presbyopia we believe that our solution can also be used in conjunction with other surgical approaches that are used to treat vision disorders other than presbyopia for example we believe that our microlens procedure can be combined with lasik procedures in order to treat those presbyopes who also suffer from a refractive disorder commonly treated with a lasik procedure such as myopia or the inability to focus on distant objects nearsightedness hyperopia or the inability to focus on near objects farsightedness and astigmatism an optical defect which causes blurred vision we also believe that our microlens procedure can be combined with iol procedures to treat those presbyopes who also have cataracts in addition we believe that our microlens can be used to treat presbyopia in certain postlasik and postcataract surgery patients we believe that having undergone refractive eye surgery in the past such patients are more likely than the general population to consider eye surgery to treat presbyopia moreover as we believe that our solution can be performed at the same time that certain other forms of visioncorrection treatments are performed we believe that our solution provides an integrated treatment option for patients and an additional source of revenue for the patient’s ophthalmic surgeon in this way we believe that our solution complements existing surgical treatments for vision problems we believe that our solution also offers each of the following benefits  our solution is minimally invasive our microlens can be implanted and removed in a simple surgical procedure  we believe that our solution offers significant near vision improvement with little or no loss of binocular distance visual acuity the ability to see distant objects with both eyes without prescription enhancement and minimal risk of adverse side effects  our solution offers a wide range of corrective power from  diopters to  diopters in  diopter increments a diopter is a unit of measurement of the optical power of a lens and  once implanted our microlens is invisible to the naked eye in  we completed a month multicenter postmarketing evaluation in italy and greece of our microlens in presbyopic patients between the ages of  and  we designed and oversaw the implementation of the protocol for this evaluation which was conducted at our request by a surgeon at the vardinoyannion eye institute of the university of crete in crete greece and by a surgeon at prato hospital in prato italy the month data for the  patients who completed the study generally demonstrated successful patient outcomes measured in terms of improvement in neardistance visual acuity the ability to see close objects the average uncorrected near visual acuity the ability to see close objects without prescription enhancement or ucvanear in the operated eye of the  patients who completed the study was  presurgery and  of those patients started the study with ucvanear in the operated eye of  or worse following implantation with our microlens such patients had an average ucvanear of   months postsurgery  of such patients completed the study with  or better ucvanear in the operated eye and  of such patients completed the study with  or better ucvanear in the operated eye although there was a slight loss in uncorrected distance visual acuity the ability to see distant objects without prescription enhancement or ucvadistance in the operated eye there was no significant change in binocular ucvadistance ucvadistance when using both eyes from before treatment to after treatment in this study our microlens has also been the subject of certain third party studies we did not commission these studies or design review or oversee the implementation of their protocols and we have limited information with respect to these studies our microlens procedure is performed using a  kilohertz or greater frequency femtosecond laser which is a laser that is currently used in certain lasik surgeries cataract surgeries and cornea replacement surgeries in commercializing our solution we intend to target those markets with a wellestablished presence of highvolume refractive laser centers equipped with femtosecond lasers we believe that the existing infrastructure in most such laser centers is sufficient to make our solution an attractive opportunity for such laser centers and will also minimize our anticipated capital investment in equipment and training in connection with our commercialization efforts our commercialization strategy includes working closely with such laser centers to train and qualify ophthalmic surgeons on the use of our solution through our european union ce mark we are generally authorized to market our microlens throughout the european economic area  of the  european union member states plus iceland liechtenstein and norway or eea and switzerland we currently market our microlens in certain strategic eea countries as well as certain strategic countries outside of the eea in which we possess marketing approval through the filing date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part ophthalmic surgeons have implanted over  of our microlenses outside of the united states we are presently seeking marketing approval in other strategic countries including the united states in december  we received approval to commence a staged pivotal clinical trial as part of the us food and drug administration or fda approval process beginning in may  we enrolled a total of  subjects at six investigational sites in the united states beginning in june  these subjects underwent insertion of our microlens in the nondominant eye based on sixmonth data on  subjects on january   we submitted an interim safety report to the fda as a supplement to our investigational device exemption or ide if the fda finds no safety concerns we anticipate the fda will permit us to continue enrollment and to increase the study population size and the number of investigational sites conducting our clinical study we are targeting enrollment of an additional  subjects for a total of  subjects at up to  investigational sites in the united states this study is necessary in order to obtain clinical data to provide the primary support for a safety and effectiveness evaluation to support a premarket approval or pma for marketing clearance in the united states data on a minimum of  subjects with month data will be submitted as part of the pma and all subjects will be followed for three years following implantation assuming the fda finds no safety concerns in our interim safety report we are targeting approval from the fda to continue enrollment in our study in the first or second quarter of  we are targeting submission of our final pma to the fda with month data on  subjects in the second quarter of  we are pursuing a modular pma submission strategy whereby we intend to submit to the fda information regarding preclinical testing engineering and manufacturing in the fourth quarter of  or first quarter of  prior to the submission of our final pma we are targeting pma approval of our microlens in the fourth quarter of  we are also targeting submission to the fda of a final report with month data on these  subjects in the second quarter of  these milestones could be delayed by further interactions with the fda or by a variety of other factors in addition no assurance can be given that the fda will grant us pma approval or if granted that it will be granted in accordance with our anticipated time schedule also the fda may require us to conduct postapproval studies as a condition of approval we expect to use approximately  million of the net proceeds of this offering to cover the total anticipated remaining costs to advance our microlens and our microlens inserter through our us staged pivotal clinical trial the proceeds from this offering are expected to be sufficient to fund our general operations through the completion of our us staged pivotal clinical trial to achieve our goal of becoming a leading provider of corneal inlay presbyopiacorrecting treatment worldwide we are pursuing the following strategies  rapidly expand commercialization outside the united states in countries where our ce mark is recognized as well as in other countries where our microlens is approved  continue to select medical centers already equipped with the necessary laser equipment as initial commercialization targets thus limiting the capital investment required by our physician partners and providing us with an existing potential customer base  advance our microlens through a staged pivotal us clinical trial and  provide training and education to key opinion leaders including respected ophthalmologists in addition our microlens and the procedure to implant our microlens are not currently reimbursed through private or governmental thirdparty payors in any country nor do we anticipate that they will be reimbursable in the foreseeable future although the commercialization of our microlens depends on a prospective patient’s ability to cover the costs of our microlens and the implantation procedure and we believe that a substantial portion of presbyopes worldwide do not have the financial means to cover the costs of our microlens we believe that a direct patient pay model enables medical providers to avoid pricing pressure from private or governmental thirdparty payors  our principal executive offices are located at  baggot street lower dublin  ireland and our telephone number is     our website address is wwwpresbiacom full
