directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun

csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not

press release reflect expectations as of may    we assume no obligation to update these statements  results may be materially different and are affected by many factors detailed in this release and in travelports quarterly and annual securities and exchange commission sec filings andor furnishings which are available on the secs website at wwwsecgov our guidance for the full year  is unchanged as

that enett its commercial payments business will grow net revenue by at least  in  this is subject to exchange rate movements given that enetts net revenue is largely denominated in currencies other

income taxes of  million to  million adjusted net income guidance excludes the expected impact of amortization of intangible assets of approximately  million expected equitybased compensation and related taxes and corporate and restructuring costs of  million to  million and expected income tax benefit related to these adjustments of  million to  million we are unable to reconcile adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to net income loss determined under us gaap due to the unavailability of information required to reasonably predict certain reconciling items such as loss on early extinguishment of debt impairment of longlived assets unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments and the related tax impact of these adjustments  adjusted

reflects expected net cash provided by operating activities for  of  million to  million less cash additions to property and equipment of  million to  million this guidance assumes spot foreign exchange rates as of may   together with the impact of foreign exchange rate hedges undertaken during  as part of our rolling hedging program  impact of foreign exchange movements our results of operations are reported in us dollars  with approximately  of our net revenue denominated in us dollars in the first quarter of  exchange rate movements in this currency have a low impact on our net revenue  of our costs and expenses in the first quarter of  excluding depreciation on property and equipment amortization of customer loyalty payments amortization of acquired intangible assets and noncore corporate costs approximately  were denominated in us dollars  we employ foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates particularly against the british pound the euro and the australian dollar which are the main nonus dollar components of our costs and expenses  the year over year impact of foreign exchange movements had a positive impact to

net income loss excluding depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of customer loyalty payments interest expense net excluding unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivative instruments and related income taxes adjusted income loss per share  diluted is defined as adjusted net income loss for the period divided by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares adjusted net income loss is defined as net income loss from continuing operations excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets gain loss on early extinguishment of debt and items that are excluded under our debt covenants such as noncash equitybased compensation certain corporate and restructuring costs noncash impairment of longlived assets certain litigation and related costs and other noncash items such as unrealized foreign currency gains losses on earnings hedges and unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivative instruments along with any income tax related to these exclusions adjusted operating income loss is defined as adjusted ebitda less depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments capital expenditures is defined as cash paid for property and equipment plus repayments in relation to capital leases and other indebtedness customer loyalty payments are payments made to travel agencies or travel providers with an objective of increasing the number of travel bookings using the companys travel commerce platform and to improve the travel agencies or travel providers loyalty which are instrumented through agreements with a term over a year under the contractual terms the travel agency or travel provider commits to achieve certain economic objectives for the company such costs are specifically identifiable to individual contracts with travel agencies or travel providers which have determinable contractual lives due to the contractual nature of the payments the company believes that such assets are appropriately classified as intangible assets free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations less cash used for additions

represents travel commerce platform revenue per segment and is computed by dividing travel commerce platform revenue by the total number of reported segments travelport worldwide limitednongaap financial measuresunaudited nongaap financial measures we utilize nongaap or adjusted financial measures including adjusted ebitda adjusted operating income loss adjusted net income loss and adjusted net income loss per share – diluted to provide useful supplemental information to assist investors in understanding and assessing our performance and financial results on the same basis that management uses internally these adjusted financial measures provide investors greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to evaluate our core operations forecast future results determine future capital investment allocations and understand business trends within the industry these metrics are also used by our board of directors to determine incentive compensation for future periods management believes the adjusted financial measures assist investors in the comparison of financial results between periods as such measures exclude certain items that management believes are not reflective of our core operating performance consistent with how management reviews the business adjusted net income loss adjusted net income loss per share – diluted adjusted operating income loss and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or net income loss per share – diluted as determined under us gaap in addition these measures may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies we believe adjusted income loss per sharediluted is a useful measure for our investors as it represents on a per share basis our consolidated results taking into account depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense excluding unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivative instruments and related income taxes but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses  adjusted income loss per sharediluted has similar limitations as adjusted net income loss adjusted operating income loss and adjusted ebitda and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies  in addition adjusted net income loss does not include all items that affect our net income loss and net income loss per share for the period  therefore we believe it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated condensed statements of operations we believe our important measure of liquidity is free cash flow this measure is useful indicator of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity demands we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our operating liquidity we believe it typically presents an alternate measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of our ongoing operations and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our platform  we believe it provides investors with an understanding of how assets are performing and measures managements effectiveness in managing cash  free cash flow is nongaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies  this measure has limitation in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period nor do they represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures this measure should not be considered as measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations as determined under us gaap we use capital expenditures to determine our total cash spent on acquisition of property and equipment and cash repayment of capital lease obligation and other indebtedness we believe this measure provides management and investors an understanding of total capital invested in the development of our platform capital expenditures is a nongaap measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other entities this measure has limitation in that it aggregates cash flows from investing and financing activities as determined under us gaap management uses net debt to review our overall liquidity financial flexibility capital structure and leverage  further we believe certain debt rating agencies creditors and credit analysts monitor our net debt as part of their assessment of our business  net debt is not a measurement of our indebtedness under us gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternative to assess our total debt or any other measures derived in accordance with us gaap these nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of travelports results as reported under us gaap to view the

certain nongaap financial measures as defined under sec rules  as required by sec rules important information regarding such measures is contained below jpg jpg jpg jpg jpg     travelport worldwide limited definitions     definitions adjusted ebitda is defined as adjusted net income loss excluding depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of customer loyalty payments interest expense net and income taxes adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations adjusted to remove the impact of cash paid for other adjusting items which we believe are unrelated to our ongoing operations and to deduct capital expenditures adjusted income loss per share  diluted is defined as adjusted net income loss for the period divided by weighted average number of dilutive common shares adjusted net income loss is defined as net income loss from continuing operations excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets gain loss on early extinguishment of debt share of earnings losses in equity method investments and items that are excluded under our debt covenants such as gain on sale of shares of orbitz worldwide inc noncash equitybased compensation certain corporate and restructuring costs certain litigation and related costs and other noncash items such as foreign currency gains losses on euro denominated debt and earnings hedges along with any income tax related to these exclusions capital expenditures is defined as cash paid for property and equipment plus repayments in relation to capital leases and other indebtedness customer loyalty payments are payments made to travel agencies or travel providers with an objective of increasing the number of travel bookings using the company’s travel commerce platform and to improve the travel agencies or travel providers’ loyalty which are instrumented through agreements with a term over a year under the contractual terms the travel agency or travel provider commits to achieve certain economic objectives for the company such costs are specifically identifiable to individual contracts with travel agencies or travel providers which have determinable contractual lives due to the contractual nature of the payments the company believes that such assets are appropriately classified as intangible assets net debt is defined as total debt comprising of current and noncurrent portion of longterm debt minus cash and cash equivalents and cash held as collateral reported segments means travel provider revenue generating units net of cancellations sold by our travel agency network geographically presented by region based upon the point of sale location travel commerce platform revpas “revpas” represents revenue per segment and is computed by dividing travel commerce platform revenue by the total number of reported segments   trading working capital is defined as assets and liabilities directly related to our core trading operations accounts receivables and deferred revenue from travel providers and travel agencies current prepaid travel agency incentive payments and accounts payable and accrued liabilities for commissions and incentives unlevered adjusted free cash flow is defined as adjusted free cash flow adjusted to remove the impact of cash interest payments     travelport worldwide limited nongaap financial measures     nongaap financial measures adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss as determined under us gaap  in addition adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies  we have included adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda as they are the primary metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the underlying operations and business trends forecast future results and determine future capital investment allocations  they are also used by our board to determine incentive compensation for future periods we believe our important measures of liquidity are adjusted free cash flow and unlevered adjusted free cash flow these measures are useful indicators of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity demands  we believe adjusted free cash flow and unlevered adjusted free cash flow provide investors with an understanding of how assets are performing and measures management’s effectiveness in managing cash  we believe these measures give management and investors a better understanding of the cash flows generated by our underlying business as our interest payments are primarily related to the debt incurred in relation to previous business acquisitions cash paid for other adjusting items are unrelated to the underlying business and our capital expenditures are primarily related to the development of our operating platforms  adjusted free cash flow and unlevered adjusted free cash flow are nongaap measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies  these measures should not be considered as measures of liquidity or cash flows from operations as determined under us gaap we believe adjusted income loss per sharediluted is a useful measure for our investors as it represents on a per share basis our consolidated results taking into account depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments which we believe are ongoing costs of doing business as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense and related taxes but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses  adjusted income loss per sharediluted has similar limitations as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income loss and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies  in addition adjusted net income loss does not include all items that affect our net income loss and net income loss per share for the period  therefore we believe it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations the management uses net debt to review the company’s overall liquidity financial flexibility capital structure and leverage  further we believe certain debt rating agencies creditors and credit analysts monitor our net debt as part of their assessment of our business  net debt is not a measurement of our indebtedness under us gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternative to assess our total debt or any other measures derived in accordance with us gaap we present trading working capital which is a nongaap measure  we view trading working capital as a key liquidity measure to understanding our cash sources and uses from operations these nongaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of travelport’s results as reported under us gaap   fred lindgren to
