richard belluzzo home press room profiles richard belluzzo profiles richard belluzzo richard belluzzo bs  lhd  us venture partner at innogest sgr spa leading with a hard head  a soft heart rick belluzzo is a managing director at corso partners he was previously the ceo and chair of quantum corp the yearold electronic records storage company located in san jose california whose products store a trove of corporate data the company sold its hard drive business in  and rick came aboard in  charged with turning around quantum and reinventing the stalwart storage company and former hard drive supplier into a storage systems company  a tall order in todays highly competitive information technology market going to college was not a tradition in his family rick was the first and only family member who graduated of his experience at ggu rick says in some ways i was typical of what ggu stood for i attended santa rosa junior college and had to pay my own way the tuition was  per semester i came to ggu because i had to work while finishing my degree i took day classes and some night classes and was hired as an intern at hood  strong it was a focused life i took the bus back and forth and had classes in the morning in the afternoon and i worked in the financial district and studied on the bus it took me  years and one additional semester to complete my degree it is clear that rick credits his experience at hewlett packard with sculpting his professional personality and honing his leadership skills he started with hp in their santa rosa office before moving to boise idaho where he spent most of his effort establishing the companys laser printer and imaging divisions after  years of success rick was confronted with the decision to try to become the ceo of hp or to try something different after some thought belluzzo resigned from hewlett packard in  and left boise idaho to become president and ceo of silicon graphics inc in redwood city california a highend graphics computer manufacturer which at its peak boasted annual sales of  billion and employed  people after two years at sgi rick left after putting in a great deal of effort to salvage the business whose products were being eclipsed by the desktop pc however shortly after leaving sgi belluzzo was hired to head up microsofts consumer and commerce group which included msn internet services the xbox video game and a series of other consumeroriented businesses in february  he assumed the role of president and coo where he would remain until a major restructuring in april  after leaving microsoft belluzzo was enlightened by barry diller the highlyregarded ceo and chair of iac iac operates leading and diversified businesses in sectors being transformed by the internet including expedia ticketmaster lending tree realestatecom matchcom citysearch and evite diller spoke persuasively about the evolution of the internet in the technology industry and the need for leaders with ricks skills to help troubled companies through transformation rick was inspired to look at the opportunity to run quantum corp thinking back on his education rick remembers golden gate university fondly ggu was a perfect fit for me it is a special place i enjoyed my time there ggus mission to offer practical education to working adults is worth more today than ever ggu continues to serve a real purpose in the needs of working people just as it did for me in the past you went to college and then to work for one company where you stayed and worked and that tended to be what you did for the remainder of your career now thats not good enough we have to think about reinventing ourselves during our careers and having a formal academic process to support that changeover is essential

belluzzo resigns some suspect corporate culture is to blame for his unexpected departure after  months by john cook seattle postintelligencer reporter updated  pm wednesday april   image of captionclose image  of  belluzzo belluzzo microsoft president and coo belluzzo resigns    back to gallery fourteen months after being named president and chief operating officer at microsoft corp richard belluzzo is leaving the software company he said last night the unexpected resignation prompted speculation that microsofts corporate culture dominated for more than  years by chairman bill gates and chief executive steve ballmer can be difficult for outside executives to penetrate it is an exceptional person who can come in and make it there from the outside said john coutts an executive recruiter at kornferry international microsoft is very resultsoriented and moves very quickly it is almost like baptism by fire belluzzo the former chief executive at silicon graphics inc and a longtime hewlettpackard co executive admits that it was difficult to fit in at first good companies have strong cultures belluzzo said in an interview with the seattle postintelligencer i think over the last number of months ironically i felt like i made a transition and learned the aspects of the company and how to operate within it and what is unique about the culture i dont think that is the issue latest business videos microsoft has no plans to replace belluzzo  who said the decision to leave the company was made after private discussions with ballmer about the structure of the organization as part of those discussions ballmer and belluzzo decided to give more control and financial responsibility to individual business unit leaders under that structure belluzzo said his responsibilities would be diminished being the person in the middle to help make the pieces work together was not going to be an important role over time he said that was becoming increasingly clear over the last couple of months and it culminated in us making the decision that i dont want to be in a role that is not vital and not essential in a news release issued yesterday afternoon ballmer said microsoft will miss belluzzos leadership and experience ballmer also emphasized the new corporate structure saying it would give deeper control of the individual business units to the managers that run them belluzzo who joined microsoft in september  and was promoted to the senior leadership team in last february  said he would like to stay in seattle where he now lives with his new wife belluzzo also wants to lead another company though he said i dont know where it is or what it is or anything like that for the next five months he will work with microsoft during a transition period belluzzos resignation caught many analysts by surprise though several said shakeups among microsofts senior management are becoming commonplace they do have the reorganization du jour thing going on over there said jonathan geurkink an analyst at ragen mckenzie but i have to say i was surprised that he was leaving i didnt see that coming scott mcadams president of seattlebased investment firm mcadams wright ragen inc and a longtime microsoft watcher agreed that management structure shakeups arent unusual for microsoft this company is fairly notorious for doing this he said while belluzzo was someone ballmer handpicked his departure signals that obviously bill and steve are not real happy with the way things are going and hes taking the heat whether its his fault or not mcadams said gates and ballmer may be frustrated with microsofts efforts to break into new markets including television settop boxes or smart phones they look at the money spent on rd research and development and they look at how theyre doing and they say we should be doing better than that mcadams said i dont think rick is to blame but hes the fall guy under its new structure it sounds like steve will roll up his sleeves and do it himself at the end of the day its still the bill and steve show mcadams said they expect a lot theyre driven guys the news of belluzzos departure and microsofts reorganization comes a day after goldman sachs  co issued a report saying that the company will earn less than forecast in its next fiscal year the stock fell  tuesday and  cents yesterday it closed yesterday at  in afterhours trading the stock rose as much as  cents closing at  microsoft stock could fall a little bit as possible concerns arise about what is going on with management geurkink said during his short tenure at microsoft belluzzo was responsible for developing marketing sales and business development relationships and overseeing highprofile consumer projects such as the msn internet service and xbox game console he also made contributions to microsofts heavily touted net strategy belluzzo said he was most proud of focusing the strategy behind microsofts consumer products helping with the current internal business transformation and creating the softerside relationships with employees partners and customers he came in and he helped do a lot of work on the msn side and got that organization whipped into shape geurkink said like his predecessor bob herbold belluzzo  who spent  years at hewlettpackard  brought an outsiders perspective to microsoft guerkink said with  employees and revenue topping  billion guerkink said microsoft needs that outside influence i think microsoft wants to think of itself as a nimble company that can move very quickly he said it is really unusual in technology to have the original entrepreneur or founder carry the company through to this size and stature in the industry often they are bringing in professional managers overall it was a bit of a
