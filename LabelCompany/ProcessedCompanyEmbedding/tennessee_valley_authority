on may   to provide navigation flood control electricity generation fertilizer manufacturing and economic development to the tennessee valley a region particularly affected by the great depression the enterprise was a result of the efforts of senator george w norris of nebraska tva was envisioned not only as a provider but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the regions economy and society tvas service area covers most of tennessee portions of alabama mississippi and kentucky and small slices of georgia north

park new york president franklin delano roosevelt signed the tennessee valley authority act ch   stat  codified as amended at  usc §  et seq creating the tva president franklin d roosevelt signs the tva act during the s and the great depression years americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities particularly hydroelectric power facilities the concept of governmentowned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power did not employ fair operating practices and were subject to abuse by their owners utility holding companies at the expense of consumers during his presidential campaign roosevelt claimed that private utilities had selfish purposes and said never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while im president of the united states by forming utility holding companies the private sector controlled  percent of generation by  essentially unregulated this gave rise to the public utility holding company act of  puhca many private companies in the tennessee valley were bought by the federal government others shut down unable to compete with the tva government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with tva on the other hand there were economic libertarians who believed the government should not participate in the electricity generation business fearing government ownership would lead to the misuse of hydroelectric sitescitation neededdubious – discuss tva was one of the first federal hydropower agencies and today most of the nations major hydropower systems are federally managed other attempts to create tvalike regional agencies have failed such as a proposed columbia valley authority for the columbia river in the pacific northwest wilson dam completed in  was the first dam under the authority of tva created in  regional power consumers may benefit from lowercost electricity supplied from tvas network of  powerproducing hydropower facilities supporters of tva though note that the agencys management of the tennessee river system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually opponents such as dean russell in the tva idea in addition to condemning the project as being socialist argued that tva created a hidden loss by preventing the creation of factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished defenders note that tva is overwhelmingly popular in tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike as barry goldwater discovered in  when he proposed selling the agency the supreme court of the united states ruled tva to be constitutional in ashwander v tennessee valley authority  us   the court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable the war powers also authorized the project the argument before the court was that electricity generation was a byproduct of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional historyedit muscle shoals controversy –edit in the s a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the tennessee valley based on the world war i federal dam at muscle shoals alabama it would generate electricity and produce fertilizer senator george norris of nebraska blocked a proposal from henry ford in  to use the dam to modernize the valley norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies he did get congress to pass the muscle shoals bill but it was vetoed as socialistic by president herbert hoover in  the idea behind the muscle shoals bill in  became a core part of the new deals tva sedit a carpenter wearing a contractors employee badge at work during the  construction of the douglas dam in east tennessee even by depression standards the tennessee valley was economically dismal in  thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria and the average income was only  per year with some families surviving on as little as  per year much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long eroding and depleting the soil crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes the best timber had been cut with another  of forests being burnt each year tva was designed to modernize the region using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems tva developed fertilizers taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests control forest fires and improve habitat for fish and wildlife the most dramatic change in valley life came from tvagenerated electricity electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive electricity also drew industries into the region providing desperately needed jobs tvas first board l to r harcourt morgan arthur e morgan and david lilienthal none of this was easy the development of the dams displaced more than  families this created antitva sentiment in some rural communitiescitation needed many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies but tva successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions a tennessee farmer would not take advice from an official in a suit and tie so tva officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility once they had convinced the leaders the rest followed at its inception tva was based in muscle shoals alabama but later moved its headquarters to knoxville tennessee where they remain today at one point tvas headquarters were housed in the old federal customs house at the corner of clinch avenue and market street the building is now a museum employment policyedit the authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation economic development and social programs such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area the professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region the workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day tva hired a few african americans for janitorial or other lowlevel positions tva recognized labor unions its skilled and semiskilled blue collar employees were unionized a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners and textile workers unions women were excluded from construction work tvas cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area and they hired mostly women as workers sedit the douglas dam early in its construction in  during world war ii the us needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity to provide the power tva engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the us by early in  when the effort reached its peak  hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time and design and construction employment reached a total of  the largest project of this period was the fontana dam after negotiations led by vicepresident harry truman i want aluminum i dont care if i get it from alcoa or al capone tva purchased the land from nantahala power and light a wholly owned subsidiary of alcoa and built fontana dam the government originally intended the electricity generated from fontana to be used by alcoa factories by the time the dam generated power in early  the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing as tva also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at oak ridge tennessee as required for the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb sedit by the end of the war tva had completed a mile kilometer navigation channel the length of the tennessee river and had become the nations largest electricity supplier even so the demand for electricity was outstripping tvas capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams political interference kept tva from securing additional federal appropriations to build coalfired plants so it sought the authority to issue bonds congress passed legislation in  to make the tva power system selffinancing and from that point on it would pay its own way sedit the s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the tennessee valley electric rates were among the nations lowest and stayed low as tva brought larger more efficient generating units into service expecting the valleys electric power needs to continue to grow tva began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power during this decade and the s tva was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project – the tellico dam project the project was initially conceived in the s but not completed until  s and sedit significant changes occurred in the economy of the tennessee valley and the nation prompted by an international oil embargo in  and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade the average cost of electricity in the tennessee valley increased fivefold from the early s to the early s tva canceled the construction of  nuclear power plants in the s the s saw the last and most controversial of the tvas large damreservoir projects tellico dam the tellico dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter a lawsuit was filed under the endangered species act and the us supreme court ruled in favor of protecting the snail darter in tennessee valley authority v hill marvin t runyon became chairman of the tennessee valley authority in january  he claimed to reduce management layers cut overhead costs by more than  and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of  billion he said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years sedit as the electricutility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation tva began preparing for competition it cut operating costs by nearly  million a year reduced its workforce by more than half increased the generating capacity of its plants stopped building nuclear plants and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the tennessee valley through the year  sedit may  map of tva sites   dam   nuclear   fossil in  tva began work to restart a

scrubbers in several others or convert them to make them cleaner at a cost of  billion over the next years according to the obama administrations proposed – budget the budget also says that reducing or eliminating the federal governments role in programs such as tva which have achieved their original objectives and no longer require federal participation can help put the nation on a sustainable

program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nationbuilding effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director david lilienthal the tva was controversial in the s historian thomas mccraw concludes  p  that roosevelt rescued the power industry from its own abuses but he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will new dealers hoped to build numerous other tvas around the country but were defeated by wendell willkie and the conservative coalition in congress the valley authority model did not replace the limitedpurpose water programs of the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers statecentered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the new deal era when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate congress and the administration however it has been shown that in river policy the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered the tva bill was passed in  because reformers like norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists in  however after regrouping opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the new dealers spending mood by expanding the army corps flood control program they also helped defeat further valley authorities the most promising of the new deal water policy reforms ronald reagan fired by general electric for criticizing tva when democrats after  proclaimed the tennessee valley authority as a model for countries in the developing world to follow conservative critics charged it was a topheavy centralized technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways thus when the program was used as the basis for modernization programs in various parts of the third world during the cold war such as in the mekong delta in vietnam its failure brought a backlash of cynicism toward modernization programs that has persisted thenmovie star ronald reagan had moved to television as the host and a frequent performer for general electric theater during  reagan was later fired by general electric in  in response to his publicly referring to the tva tva being a major customer for ge turbines as one of the problems of big government some claim that reagan was instead fired due to a criminal antitrust investigation involving him and the screen actors guild however reagan was only interviewed nobody was actually charged with anything in the investigation in  us senator and republican presidential candidate barry goldwater was quoted in a saturday evening post article by stewart alsop as saying you know i think we ought to sell tva he had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the authority including its fertilizer production and steamgeneration facilities because it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry goldwaters saturday evening post quotation was used against him in a tv ad by doyle dane bernbach for president lyndon johnsons  campaign which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam it was voiced over as follows in a saturday evening post article dated august   barry goldwater said you know i think we ought to sell tva this is a promise president johnson will not sell tva vote for him on november  the stakes are too high for you to stay home in  the tva board of directors broke with

franklin d roosevelt presidential library and museum in hyde park new york president franklin delano roosevelt signed the tennessee valley authority act ch   stat  codified as amended at  usc §  et seq creating the tva president franklin d roosevelt signs the tva act during the s and the great depression years americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities particularly hydroelectric power facilities the concept of governmentowned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power did not employ fair operating practices and were subject to abuse by their owners utility holding companies at the expense of consumers during his presidential campaign roosevelt claimed that private utilities had selfish purposes and said never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while im president of the united states by forming utility holding companies the private sector controlled  percent of generation by  essentially unregulated this gave rise to the public utility holding company act of  puhca many private companies in the tennessee valley were bought by the federal government others shut down unable to compete with the tva government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with tva on the other hand there were economic libertarians who believed the government should not participate in the electricity generation business fearing government ownership would lead to the misuse of hydroelectric sitescitation neededdubious – discuss tva was one of the first federal hydropower agencies and today most of the nations major hydropower systems are federally managed other attempts to create tvalike regional agencies have failed such as a proposed columbia valley authority for the columbia river in the pacific northwest wilson dam completed in  was the first dam under the authority of tva created in  regional power consumers may benefit from lowercost electricity supplied from tvas network of  powerproducing hydropower facilities supporters of tva though note that the agencys management of the tennessee river system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually opponents such as dean russell in the tva idea in addition to condemning the project as being socialist argued that tva created a hidden loss by preventing the creation of factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished defenders note that tva is overwhelmingly popular in tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike as barry goldwater discovered in  when he proposed selling the agency the supreme court of the united states ruled tva to be constitutional in ashwander v tennessee valley authority  us   the court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable the war powers also authorized the project the argument before the court was that electricity generation was a byproduct of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional historyedit muscle shoals controversy –edit in the s a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the tennessee valley based on the world war i federal dam at muscle shoals alabama it would generate electricity and produce fertilizer senator george norris of nebraska blocked a proposal from henry ford in  to use the dam to modernize the valley norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies he did get congress to pass the muscle shoals bill but it was vetoed as socialistic by president herbert hoover in  the idea behind the muscle shoals bill in  became a core part of the new deals tva sedit a carpenter wearing a contractors employee badge at work during the  construction of the douglas dam in east tennessee even by depression standards the tennessee valley was economically dismal in  thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria and the average income was only  per year with some families surviving on as little as  per year much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long eroding and depleting the soil crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes the best timber had been cut with another  of forests being burnt each year tva was designed to modernize the region using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems tva developed fertilizers taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests control forest fires and improve habitat for fish and wildlife the most dramatic change in valley life came from tvagenerated electricity electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive electricity also drew industries into the region providing desperately needed jobs tvas first board l to r harcourt morgan arthur e morgan and david lilienthal none of this was easy the development of the dams displaced more than  families this created antitva sentiment in some rural communitiescitation needed many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies but tva successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions a tennessee farmer would not take advice from an official in a suit and tie so tva officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility once they had convinced the leaders the rest followed at its inception tva was based in muscle shoals alabama but later moved its headquarters to knoxville tennessee where they remain today at one point tvas headquarters were housed in the old federal customs house at the corner of clinch avenue and market street the building is now a museum employment policyedit the authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation economic development and social programs such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area the professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region the workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day tva hired a few african americans for janitorial or other lowlevel positions tva recognized labor unions its skilled and semiskilled blue collar employees were unionized a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners and textile workers unions women were excluded from construction work tvas cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area and they hired mostly women as workers sedit the douglas dam early in its construction in  during world war ii the us needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity to provide the power tva engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the us by early in  when the effort reached its peak  hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time and design and construction employment reached a total of  the largest project of this period was the fontana dam after negotiations led by vicepresident harry truman i want aluminum i dont care if i get it from alcoa or al capone tva purchased the land from nantahala power and light a wholly owned subsidiary of alcoa and built fontana dam the government originally intended the electricity generated from fontana to be used by alcoa factories by the time the dam generated power in early  the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing as tva also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at oak ridge tennessee as required for the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb sedit by the end of the war tva had completed a mile kilometer navigation channel the length of the tennessee river and had become the nations largest electricity supplier even so the demand for electricity was outstripping tvas capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams political interference kept tva from securing additional federal appropriations to build coalfired plants so it sought the authority to issue bonds congress passed legislation in  to make the tva power system selffinancing and from that point on it would pay its own way sedit the s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the tennessee valley electric rates were among the nations lowest and stayed low as tva brought larger more efficient generating units into service expecting the valleys electric power needs to continue to grow tva began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power during this decade and the s tva was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project – the tellico dam project the project was initially conceived in the s but not completed until  s and sedit significant changes occurred in the economy of the tennessee valley and the nation prompted by an international oil embargo in  and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade the average cost of electricity in the tennessee valley increased fivefold from the early s to the early s tva canceled the construction of  nuclear power plants in the s the s saw the last and most controversial of the tvas large damreservoir projects tellico dam the tellico dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter a lawsuit was filed under the endangered species act and the us supreme court ruled in favor of protecting the snail darter in tennessee valley authority v hill marvin t runyon became chairman of the tennessee valley authority in january  he claimed to reduce management layers cut overhead costs by more than  and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of  billion he said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years sedit as the electricutility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation tva began preparing for competition it cut operating costs by nearly  million a year reduced its workforce by more than half increased the generating capacity of its plants stopped building nuclear plants and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the tennessee valley through the year  sedit may  map of tva sites

congress tva must retire at least  of its  coalfired units by  and install scrubbers in several others or convert them to make them cleaner at a cost of  billion over the next years according to the

dealers and the new deal coalition not only as a successful economic development program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nationbuilding effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director david lilienthal the tva was controversial in the s historian thomas mccraw concludes  p  that roosevelt rescued the power industry from its own abuses but he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will new dealers hoped to build numerous other tvas around the country but were defeated by wendell willkie and the conservative coalition in congress the valley authority model did not replace the limitedpurpose water programs of the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers statecentered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the new deal era when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate congress and the administration however it has been shown that in river policy the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered the tva bill was passed in  because reformers like norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists in  however after regrouping opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the new dealers spending mood by expanding the army corps flood control program they also helped defeat further valley authorities the most promising of the new deal water policy reforms ronald reagan fired by general electric for criticizing tva when democrats after  proclaimed the tennessee valley authority as a model for countries in the developing world to follow conservative critics charged it was a topheavy centralized technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways thus when the program was used as the basis for modernization programs in various parts of the third world during the cold war such as in the mekong delta in vietnam its failure brought a backlash of cynicism toward modernization programs that has persisted thenmovie star ronald reagan had moved to television as the host and a frequent performer for general electric theater during  reagan was later fired by general electric in  in response to his publicly referring to the tva tva being a major customer for ge turbines as one of the problems of big government some claim that reagan was instead fired due to a criminal antitrust investigation involving him and the screen actors guild however reagan was only interviewed nobody was actually charged with anything in the investigation in  us senator and republican presidential candidate barry goldwater was quoted in a saturday evening post article by stewart alsop as saying you know i think we ought to sell tva he had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the authority including its fertilizer production and steamgeneration facilities because it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry goldwaters saturday evening post quotation was used against him in a tv ad by doyle dane bernbach for president lyndon johnsons  campaign which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam it was voiced over as follows in a saturday evening post article dated august   barry goldwater said you know i think we ought to sell tva this is a promise president johnson will not sell tva vote for him on november  the stakes are too high for you to stay home in  the tva board of directors broke with previous tradition and took a hard line against whitecollar unions during contract negotiations as a result a class action suit was filed in  in us court

angels in the controversy between it and the utilities but the conservation program of the tvas is only a masquerade it has no functional connection with the power program of the authority and the amount spent on it is only an insignificant portion of the authority’s total expenditures other departments of government both state and national are charged with the duty of caring for soil erosion and are doing such work effectively without the building of dams and power facilities… the american people are paying more than half a billion dollars for eleven dams chiefly designed to supply power

regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the regions economy and society tvas service area covers most of tennessee portions of alabama mississippi and kentucky and small slices of georgia north carolina and virginia it was the first large regional planning agency of the federal government and remains the largest under the leadership

franklin d roosevelt presidential library and museum in hyde park new york president franklin delano roosevelt signed the tennessee valley authority act ch   stat  codified as amended at  usc §  et seq creating the tva president franklin d roosevelt signs the tva act during the s and the great depression years americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities particularly hydroelectric power facilities the concept of governmentowned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power did not employ fair operating practices and were subject to abuse by their owners utility holding companies at the expense of consumers during his presidential campaign roosevelt claimed that private utilities had selfish purposes and said never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while im president of the united states by forming utility holding companies the private sector controlled  percent of generation by  essentially unregulated this gave rise to the public utility holding company act of  puhca many private companies in the tennessee valley were bought by the federal government others shut down unable to compete with the tva government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with tva on the other hand there were economic libertarians who believed the government should not participate in the electricity generation business fearing government ownership would lead to the misuse of hydroelectric sitescitation neededdubious – discuss tva was one of the first federal hydropower agencies and today most of the nations major hydropower systems are federally managed other attempts to create tvalike regional agencies have failed such as a proposed columbia valley authority for the columbia river in the pacific northwest wilson dam completed in  was the first dam under the authority of tva created in  regional power consumers may benefit from lowercost electricity supplied from tvas network of  powerproducing hydropower facilities supporters of tva though note that the agencys management of the tennessee river system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually opponents such as dean russell in the tva idea in addition to condemning the project as being socialist argued that tva created a hidden loss by preventing the creation of factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished defenders note that tva is overwhelmingly popular in tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike as barry goldwater discovered in  when he proposed selling the agency the supreme court of the united states ruled tva to be constitutional in ashwander v tennessee valley authority  us   the court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable the war powers also authorized the project the argument before the court was that electricity generation was a byproduct of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional historyedit muscle shoals controversy –edit in the s a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the tennessee valley based on the world war i federal dam at muscle shoals alabama it would generate electricity and produce fertilizer senator george norris of nebraska blocked a proposal from henry ford in  to use the dam to modernize the valley norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies he did get congress to pass the muscle shoals bill but it was vetoed as socialistic by president herbert hoover in  the idea behind the muscle shoals bill in  became a core part of the new deals tva sedit a carpenter wearing a contractors employee badge at work during the  construction of the douglas dam in east tennessee even by depression standards the tennessee valley was economically dismal in  thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria and the average income was only  per year with some families surviving on as little as  per year much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long eroding and depleting the soil crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes the best timber had been cut with another  of forests being burnt each year tva was designed to modernize the region using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems tva developed fertilizers taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests control forest fires and improve habitat for fish and wildlife the most dramatic change in valley life came from tvagenerated electricity electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive electricity also drew industries into the region providing desperately needed jobs tvas first board l to r harcourt morgan arthur e morgan and david lilienthal none of this was easy the development of the dams displaced more than  families this created antitva sentiment in some rural communitiescitation needed many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies but tva successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions a tennessee farmer would not take advice from an official in a suit and tie so tva officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility once they had convinced the leaders the rest followed at its inception tva was based in muscle shoals alabama but later moved its headquarters to knoxville tennessee where they remain today at one point tvas headquarters were housed in the old federal customs house at the corner of clinch avenue and market street the building is now a museum employment policyedit the authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation economic development and social programs such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area the professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region the workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day tva hired a few african americans for janitorial or other lowlevel positions tva recognized labor unions its skilled and semiskilled blue collar employees were unionized a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners and textile workers unions women were excluded from construction work tvas cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area and they hired mostly women as workers sedit the douglas dam early in its construction in  during world war ii the us needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity to provide the power tva engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the us by early in  when the effort reached its peak  hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time and design and construction employment reached a total of  the largest project of this period was the fontana dam after negotiations led by vicepresident harry truman i want aluminum i dont care if i get it from alcoa or al capone tva purchased the land from nantahala power and light a wholly owned subsidiary of alcoa and built fontana dam the government originally intended the electricity generated from fontana to be used by alcoa factories by the time the dam generated power in early  the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing as tva also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at oak ridge tennessee as required for the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb sedit by the end of the war tva had completed a mile kilometer navigation channel the length of the tennessee river and had become the nations largest electricity supplier even so the demand for electricity was outstripping tvas capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams political interference kept tva from securing additional federal appropriations to build coalfired plants so it sought the authority to issue bonds congress passed legislation in  to make the tva power system selffinancing and from that point on it would pay its own way sedit the s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the tennessee valley electric rates were among the nations lowest and stayed low as tva brought larger more efficient generating units into service expecting the valleys electric power needs to continue to grow tva began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power during this decade and the s tva was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project – the tellico dam project the project was initially conceived in the s but not completed until  s and sedit significant changes occurred in the economy of the tennessee valley and the nation prompted by an international oil embargo in  and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade the average cost of electricity in the tennessee valley increased fivefold from the early s to the early s tva canceled the construction of  nuclear power plants in the s the s saw the last and most controversial of the tvas large damreservoir projects tellico dam the tellico dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter a lawsuit was filed under the endangered species act and the us supreme court ruled in favor of protecting the snail darter in tennessee valley authority v hill marvin t runyon became chairman of the tennessee valley authority in january  he claimed to reduce management layers cut overhead costs by more than  and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of  billion he said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years sedit as the electricutility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation tva began preparing for competition it cut operating costs by nearly  million a year reduced its workforce by more than half increased the generating capacity of its plants stopped building nuclear plants and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the tennessee valley through the year  sedit may  map of tva sites

congress tva must retire at least  of its  coalfired units by  and install scrubbers in several others or convert them to make them cleaner at a cost of  billion over the next years according to the

dealers and the new deal coalition not only as a successful economic development program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nationbuilding effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots

might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will new dealers hoped to build numerous other tvas around the country but were defeated by wendell willkie and the conservative coalition in congress the valley authority model did not replace the limitedpurpose water programs of the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers statecentered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the new deal era when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate congress and the administration however it has been shown that in river policy the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered the tva bill was passed in  because reformers like norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists in  however after regrouping opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the new dealers spending mood by expanding the army corps flood control program they also helped defeat further valley authorities the most promising of the new deal water policy reforms ronald reagan fired by general electric for criticizing tva when democrats after  proclaimed the tennessee valley authority as a model for countries in the developing world to follow conservative critics charged it was a topheavy centralized technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways thus when the program was used as the basis for modernization programs in various parts of the third world during the cold war such as in the mekong delta in vietnam its failure brought a backlash of cynicism toward modernization programs that has persisted thenmovie star ronald reagan had moved to television as the host and a frequent performer for general electric theater during  reagan was later fired by general electric in  in response to his publicly referring to the tva tva being

tva was envisioned not only as a provider but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the regions economy and society tvas

tennessee valley authority act ch   stat  codified as amended at  usc §  et seq creating the tva president franklin d roosevelt signs the tva act during the s and the great depression years americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities particularly hydroelectric power facilities the concept of governmentowned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power did not employ fair operating practices and were subject to abuse by their owners utility holding companies at the expense of consumers during his presidential campaign roosevelt claimed that private utilities had selfish purposes and said never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while im president of the united states by forming utility holding companies the private sector controlled  percent of generation by  essentially unregulated this gave rise to the public utility holding company act of  puhca many private companies in the tennessee valley were bought by the federal government others shut down unable to compete with the tva government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with tva on the other hand there were economic libertarians who believed the government should not participate in the electricity generation business fearing government ownership would lead to the misuse of hydroelectric sitescitation neededdubious – discuss tva was one of the first federal hydropower agencies and today most of the nations major hydropower systems are federally managed other attempts to create tvalike regional agencies have failed such as a proposed columbia valley authority for the columbia river in the pacific northwest wilson dam completed in  was the first dam under the authority of tva created in  regional power consumers may benefit from lowercost electricity supplied from tvas network of  powerproducing hydropower facilities supporters of tva though note that the agencys management of the tennessee river system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually opponents such as dean russell in the tva idea in addition to condemning the project as being socialist argued that tva created a hidden loss by preventing the creation of factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished defenders note that tva is overwhelmingly popular in tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike as barry goldwater discovered in  when he proposed selling the agency the supreme court of the united states ruled tva to be constitutional in ashwander v tennessee valley authority  us   the court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable the war powers also authorized the project the argument before the court was that electricity generation was a byproduct of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional historyedit muscle shoals controversy –edit in the s a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the tennessee valley based on the world war i federal dam at muscle shoals alabama it would generate electricity and produce fertilizer senator george norris of nebraska blocked a proposal from henry ford in  to use the dam to modernize the valley norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies he did get congress to pass the muscle shoals bill but it was vetoed as socialistic by president herbert hoover in  the idea behind the muscle shoals bill in  became a core part of the new deals tva sedit a carpenter wearing a contractors employee badge at work during the  construction of the douglas dam in east tennessee even by depression standards the tennessee valley was economically dismal in  thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria and the average income was only  per year with some families surviving on as little as  per year much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long eroding and depleting the soil crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes the best timber had been cut with another  of forests being burnt each year tva was designed to modernize the region using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems tva developed fertilizers taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests control forest fires and improve habitat for fish and wildlife the most dramatic change in valley life came from tvagenerated electricity electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive electricity also drew industries into the region providing desperately needed jobs tvas first board l to r harcourt morgan arthur e morgan and david lilienthal none of this was easy the development of the dams displaced more than  families this created antitva sentiment in some rural communitiescitation needed many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies but tva successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions a tennessee farmer would not take advice from an official in a suit and tie so tva officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility once they had convinced the leaders the rest followed at its inception tva was based in muscle shoals alabama but later moved its headquarters to knoxville tennessee where they remain today at one point tvas headquarters were housed in the old federal customs house at the corner of clinch avenue and market street the building is now a museum employment policyedit the authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation economic development and social programs such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area the professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region the workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day tva hired a few african americans for janitorial or other lowlevel positions tva recognized labor unions its skilled and semiskilled blue collar employees were unionized a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners and textile workers unions women were excluded from construction work tvas cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area and they hired mostly women as workers sedit the douglas dam early in its construction in  during world war ii the us needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity to provide the power tva engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the us by early in  when the effort reached its peak  hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time and design and construction employment reached a total of  the largest project of this period was the fontana dam after negotiations led by vicepresident harry truman i want aluminum i dont care if i get it from alcoa or al capone tva purchased the land from nantahala power and light a wholly owned subsidiary of alcoa and built fontana dam the government originally intended the electricity generated from fontana to be used by alcoa factories by the time the dam generated power in early  the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing as tva also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at oak ridge tennessee as required for the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb sedit by the end of the war tva had completed a mile kilometer navigation channel the length of the tennessee river and had become the nations largest electricity supplier even so the demand for electricity was outstripping tvas capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams political interference kept tva from securing additional federal appropriations to build coalfired plants so it sought the authority to issue bonds congress passed legislation in  to make the tva power system selffinancing and from that point on it would pay its own way sedit the s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the tennessee valley electric rates were among the nations lowest and stayed low as tva brought larger more efficient generating units into service expecting the valleys electric power needs to continue to grow tva began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power during this decade and the s tva was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project – the tellico dam project the project was initially conceived in the s but not completed until  s and sedit significant changes occurred in the economy of the tennessee valley and the nation prompted by an international oil embargo in  and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade the average cost of electricity in the tennessee valley increased fivefold from the early s to the early s tva canceled the construction of  nuclear power plants in the s the s saw the last and most controversial of the tvas large damreservoir projects tellico dam the tellico dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter a lawsuit was filed under the endangered

claimed to reduce management layers cut overhead costs by more than  and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of  billion he said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years sedit as the electricutility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation tva began preparing for competition it cut operating costs by nearly  million a year reduced its workforce by more than half increased the generating capacity of its plants stopped building nuclear plants and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the tennessee valley

tva was envisioned not only as a provider but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the regions economy and society tvas

tennessee valley authority act ch   stat  codified as amended at  usc §  et seq creating the tva president franklin d roosevelt signs the tva act during the s and the great depression years americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities particularly hydroelectric power facilities the concept of governmentowned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power did not employ fair operating practices and were subject to abuse by their owners utility holding companies at the expense of consumers during his presidential campaign roosevelt claimed that private utilities had selfish purposes and said never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while im president of the united states by forming utility holding companies the private sector controlled  percent of generation by  essentially unregulated this gave rise to the public utility holding company act of  puhca many private companies in the tennessee valley were bought by the federal government others shut down unable to compete with the tva government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with tva on the other hand there were economic libertarians who believed the government should not participate in the electricity generation business fearing government ownership would lead to the misuse of hydroelectric sitescitation neededdubious – discuss tva was one of the first federal hydropower agencies and today most of the nations major hydropower systems are federally managed other attempts to create tvalike regional agencies have failed such as a proposed columbia valley authority for the columbia river in the pacific northwest wilson dam completed in  was the first dam under the authority of tva created in  regional power consumers may benefit from lowercost electricity supplied from tvas network of  powerproducing hydropower facilities supporters of tva though note that the agencys management of the tennessee river system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually opponents such as dean russell in the tva idea in addition to condemning the project as being socialist argued that tva created a hidden loss by preventing the creation of factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished defenders note that tva is overwhelmingly popular in tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike as barry goldwater discovered in  when he proposed selling the agency the supreme court of the united states ruled tva to be constitutional in ashwander v tennessee valley authority  us   the court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable the war powers also authorized the project the argument before the court was that electricity generation was a byproduct of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional historyedit muscle shoals controversy –edit in the s a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the tennessee valley based on the world war i federal dam at muscle shoals alabama it would generate electricity and produce fertilizer senator george norris of nebraska blocked a proposal from henry ford in  to use the dam to modernize the valley norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies he did get congress to pass the muscle shoals bill but it was vetoed as socialistic by president herbert hoover in  the idea behind the muscle shoals bill in  became a core part of the new deals tva sedit a carpenter wearing a contractors employee badge at work during the  construction of the douglas dam in east tennessee even by depression standards the tennessee valley was economically dismal in  thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria and the average income was only  per year with some families surviving on as little as  per year much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long eroding and depleting the soil crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes the best timber had been cut with another  of forests being burnt each year tva was designed to modernize the region using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems tva developed fertilizers taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests control forest fires and improve habitat for fish and wildlife the most dramatic change in valley life came from tvagenerated electricity electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive electricity also drew industries into the region providing desperately needed jobs tvas first board l to r harcourt morgan arthur e morgan and david lilienthal none of this was easy the development of the dams displaced more than  families this created antitva sentiment in some rural communitiescitation needed many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies but tva successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions a tennessee farmer would not take advice from an official in a suit and tie so tva officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility once they had convinced the leaders the rest followed at its inception tva was based in muscle shoals alabama but later moved its headquarters to knoxville tennessee where they remain today at one point tvas headquarters were housed in the old federal customs house at the corner of clinch avenue and market street the building is now a museum employment policyedit the authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation economic development and social programs such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area the professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region the workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day tva hired a few african americans for janitorial or other lowlevel positions tva recognized labor unions its skilled and semiskilled blue collar employees were unionized a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners and textile workers unions women were excluded from construction work tvas cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area and they hired mostly women as workers sedit the douglas dam early in its construction in  during world war ii the us needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity to provide the power tva engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the us by early in  when the effort reached its peak  hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time and design and construction employment reached a total of  the largest project of this period was the fontana dam after negotiations led by vicepresident harry truman i want aluminum i dont care if i get it from alcoa or al capone tva purchased the land from nantahala power and light a wholly owned subsidiary of alcoa and built fontana dam the government originally intended the electricity generated from fontana to be used by alcoa factories by the time the dam generated power in early  the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing as tva also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at oak ridge tennessee as required for the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb sedit by the end of the war tva had completed a mile kilometer navigation channel the length of the tennessee river and had become the nations largest electricity supplier even so the demand for electricity was outstripping tvas capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams political interference kept tva from securing additional federal appropriations to build coalfired plants so it sought the authority to issue bonds congress passed legislation in  to make the tva power system selffinancing and from that point on it would pay its own way sedit the s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the tennessee valley electric rates were among the nations lowest and stayed low as tva brought larger more efficient generating units into service expecting the valleys electric power needs to continue to grow tva began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power during this decade and the s tva was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project – the tellico dam project the project was initially conceived in the s but not completed until  s and sedit significant changes occurred in the economy of the tennessee valley and the nation prompted by an international oil embargo in  and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade the average cost of electricity in the tennessee valley increased fivefold from the early s to the early s tva canceled the construction of  nuclear power plants in the s the s saw the last and most controversial of the tvas large damreservoir projects tellico dam the tellico dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter a lawsuit was filed under the endangered species act and the us supreme court ruled in favor of protecting the snail darter in tennessee valley authority v hill marvin t runyon became chairman of the tennessee valley authority in january  he claimed to reduce management layers cut overhead costs by more than  and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of  billion he said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years sedit as the electricutility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation tva began preparing for competition it cut operating costs by nearly  million a year reduced its workforce by more than half increased the generating capacity of its plants stopped building nuclear plants and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the tennessee valley

billion debt limit imposed by congress tva must retire at least  of its  coalfired units by  and install scrubbers in several others or convert them to make them cleaner at a cost of  billion over the next years according to the obama administrations proposed – budget the budget also says that reducing or eliminating the federal governments role in programs such as tva which have achieved their

dealers and the new deal coalition not only as a successful economic development program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nationbuilding effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director david lilienthal the tva was controversial in the s historian thomas mccraw concludes  p  that roosevelt rescued the power industry from its own abuses but he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will new dealers hoped to build numerous other tvas around the country but were defeated by wendell willkie and the conservative coalition in congress the valley authority model did not replace the limitedpurpose water programs of the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers statecentered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the new deal era when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate congress and the administration however it has been shown that in river policy the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered the tva bill was passed in  because reformers like norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists in  however after regrouping opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the new dealers spending mood by expanding the army corps flood control program they also helped defeat further valley authorities the most promising of the new deal water policy reforms ronald reagan fired by general electric for criticizing tva when democrats after  proclaimed the tennessee valley authority as a model for countries in the developing world to follow conservative critics charged it was a topheavy centralized technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways thus when the program was used as the basis for modernization programs in various parts of the third world during the cold war such as in the mekong delta in vietnam its failure brought a backlash of cynicism toward modernization programs that has persisted thenmovie star ronald reagan had moved to television as the host and a frequent performer for general electric theater during  reagan was later fired by general electric in  in response to his publicly referring to the tva tva being a major customer for ge turbines as one of the problems of big government some claim that reagan was instead fired due to a criminal antitrust investigation involving him and the screen actors guild however reagan was only interviewed nobody was actually charged with anything in the investigation in  us senator and republican presidential candidate barry goldwater was quoted in a saturday evening post article by stewart alsop as saying you know i think we ought to sell tva he had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the authority including its fertilizer production and steamgeneration facilities because it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry goldwaters saturday evening post quotation was used against him in a tv ad by doyle dane bernbach for president lyndon johnsons  campaign which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam it was voiced over as follows in a saturday evening post article

manufacturing and economic development to the tennessee valley a region particularly affected by the great depression the enterprise was a result of the efforts of senator george w norris of nebraska tva was envisioned not only as a provider but also as a regional economic development agency that would use federal experts and electricity to rapidly modernize the regions economy and society tvas service area covers most of tennessee portions of alabama mississippi and kentucky and small slices of georgia north carolina and virginia it was the first large regional planning agency of the

tennessee valley authority act ch   stat  codified as amended at  usc §  et seq creating the tva president franklin d roosevelt signs the tva act during the s and the great depression years americans began to support the idea of public ownership of utilities particularly hydroelectric power facilities the concept of governmentowned generation facilities selling to publicly owned distribution utilities was controversial and remains so today many believed privately owned power companies were charging too much for power did not employ fair operating practices and were subject to abuse by their owners utility holding companies at the expense of consumers during his presidential campaign roosevelt claimed that private utilities had selfish purposes and said never shall the federal government part with its sovereignty or with its control of its power resources while im president of the united states by forming utility holding companies the private sector controlled  percent of generation by  essentially unregulated this gave rise to the public utility holding company act of  puhca many private companies in the tennessee valley were bought by the federal government others shut down unable to compete with the tva government regulations were also passed to prevent competition with tva on the other hand there were economic libertarians who believed the government should not participate in the electricity generation business fearing government ownership would lead to the misuse of hydroelectric sitescitation neededdubious – discuss tva was one of the first federal hydropower agencies and today most of the nations major hydropower systems are federally managed other attempts to create tvalike regional agencies have failed such as a proposed columbia valley authority for the columbia river in the pacific northwest wilson dam completed in  was the first dam under the authority of tva created in  regional power consumers may benefit from lowercost electricity supplied from tvas network of  powerproducing hydropower facilities supporters of tva though note that the agencys management of the tennessee river system without appropriated federal funding saves federal taxpayers millions of dollars annually opponents such as dean russell in the tva idea in addition to condemning the project as being socialist argued that tva created a hidden loss by preventing the creation of factories and jobs that would have come into existence if the government had allowed the taxpayers to spend their money as they wished defenders note that tva is overwhelmingly popular in tennessee among conservatives and liberals alike as barry goldwater discovered in  when he proposed selling the agency the supreme court of the united states ruled tva to be constitutional in ashwander v tennessee valley authority  us   the court noted that regulating commerce among the states includes regulation of streams and that controlling floods is required for keeping streams navigable the war powers also authorized the project the argument before the court was that electricity generation was a byproduct of navigation and flood control and therefore could be considered constitutional historyedit muscle shoals controversy –edit in the s a major battle erupted over building an electric power system in the tennessee valley based on the world war i federal dam at muscle shoals alabama it would generate electricity and produce fertilizer senator george norris of nebraska blocked a proposal from henry ford in  to use the dam to modernize the valley norris deeply distrusted privately owned utility companies he did get congress to pass the muscle shoals bill but it was vetoed as socialistic by president herbert hoover in  the idea behind the muscle shoals bill in  became a core part of the new deals tva sedit a carpenter wearing a contractors employee badge at work during the  construction of the douglas dam in east tennessee even by depression standards the tennessee valley was economically dismal in  thirty percent of the population was affected by malaria and the average income was only  per year with some families surviving on as little as  per year much of the land had been farmed too hard for too long eroding and depleting the soil crop yields had fallen along with farm incomes the best timber had been cut with another  of forests being burnt each year tva was designed to modernize the region using experts and electricity to combat human and economic problems tva developed fertilizers taught farmers ways to improve crop yields and helped replant forests control forest fires and improve habitat for fish and wildlife the most dramatic change in valley life came from tvagenerated electricity electric lights and modern home appliances made life easier and farms more productive electricity also drew industries into the region providing desperately needed jobs tvas first board l to r harcourt morgan arthur e morgan and david lilienthal none of this was easy the development of the dams displaced more than  families this created antitva sentiment in some rural communitiescitation needed many local landowners were suspicious of government agencies but tva successfully introduced new agricultural methods into traditional farming communities by blending in and finding local champions a tennessee farmer would not take advice from an official in a suit and tie so tva officials had to find leaders in the communities and convince them that crop rotation and the judicious application of fertilizers could restore soil fertility once they had convinced the leaders the rest followed at its inception tva was based in muscle shoals alabama but later moved its headquarters to knoxville tennessee where they remain today at one point tvas headquarters were housed in the old federal customs house at the corner of clinch avenue and market street the building is now a museum employment policyedit the authority hired many area unemployed to conduct conservation economic development and social programs such as a library service that operated for the surrounding area the professional staff headquarters was composed of experts from outside the region the workers were categorized by the usual racial and gender lines of the day tva hired a few african americans for janitorial or other lowlevel positions tva recognized labor unions its skilled and semiskilled blue collar employees were unionized a breakthrough in an area known for corporations hostile to miners and textile workers unions women were excluded from construction work tvas cheap electricity attracted textile mills to the area and they hired mostly women as workers sedit the douglas dam early in its construction in  during world war ii the us needed greater aluminum supplies to build airplanes aluminum plants required huge amounts of electricity to provide the power tva engaged in one of the largest hydropower construction programs ever undertaken in the us by early in  when the effort reached its peak  hydroelectric plants and one steam plant were under construction at the same time and design and construction employment reached a total of  the largest project of this period was the fontana dam after negotiations led by vicepresident harry truman i want aluminum i dont care if i get it from alcoa or al capone tva purchased the land from nantahala power and light a wholly owned subsidiary of alcoa and built fontana dam the government originally intended the electricity generated from fontana to be used by alcoa factories by the time the dam generated power in early  the electricity was directed to another purpose in addition to aluminum manufacturing as tva also provided much of the electricity needed for uranium enrichment at oak ridge tennessee as required for the manhattan project and the making of the atomic bomb sedit by the end of the war tva had completed a mile kilometer navigation channel the length of the tennessee river and had become the nations largest electricity supplier even so the demand for electricity was outstripping tvas capacity to produce power from hydroelectric dams political interference kept tva from securing additional federal appropriations to build coalfired plants so it sought the authority to issue bonds congress passed legislation in  to make the tva power system selffinancing and from that point on it would pay its own way sedit the s were years of unprecedented economic growth in the tennessee valley electric rates were among the nations lowest and stayed low as tva brought larger more efficient generating units into service expecting the valleys electric power needs to continue to grow tva began building nuclear reactors as a new source of cheap power during this decade and the s tva was engaged in what was up to that time its most controversial project – the tellico dam project the project was initially conceived in the s but not completed until  s and sedit significant changes occurred in the economy of the tennessee valley and the nation prompted by an international oil embargo in  and accelerating fuel costs later in the decade the average cost of electricity in the tennessee valley increased fivefold from the early s to the early s tva canceled the construction of  nuclear power plants in the s the s saw the last and most controversial of the tvas large damreservoir projects tellico dam the tellico dam project was initially delayed because of concern over the snail darter a lawsuit was filed under the endangered species act and the us supreme court ruled in favor of protecting the snail darter in tennessee valley authority v hill marvin t runyon became chairman of the tennessee valley authority in january  he claimed to reduce management layers cut overhead costs by more than  and achieved cumulative savings and efficiency improvements of  billion he said he revitalized the nuclear program and instituted a rate freeze that continued for ten years sedit as the electricutility industry moved toward restructuring and deregulation tva began preparing for competition it cut operating costs by nearly  million a year reduced its workforce by more than half increased the generating capacity of its plants stopped building nuclear plants and developed a plan to meet the energy needs of the tennessee valley

next years according to the obama administrations proposed – budget the budget also says that reducing or eliminating the federal governments role in programs such as tva which have achieved their

dealers and the new deal coalition not only as a successful economic development program for a depressed area but also as a democratic nationbuilding effort overseas because of its alleged grassroots inclusiveness as articulated by director david lilienthal the tva was controversial in the s historian thomas mccraw concludes  p  that roosevelt rescued the power industry from its own abuses but he might have done this much with a great deal less agitation and ill will new dealers hoped to build numerous other tvas around the country but were defeated by wendell willkie and the conservative coalition in congress the valley authority model did not replace the limitedpurpose water programs of the bureau of reclamation and the army corps of engineers statecentered theorists hold that reformers are most likely to succeed during periods such as the new deal era when they are supported by a democratized polity and when they dominate congress and the administration however it has been shown that in river policy the strength of opposing interest groups also mattered the tva bill was passed in  because reformers like norris skillfully coordinated action at potential choke points and weakened the already disorganized opponents among the electric power industry lobbyists in  however after regrouping opposing river lobbyists and conservative coalition congressmen took advantage of the new dealers spending mood by expanding the army corps flood control program they also helped defeat further valley authorities the most promising of the new deal water policy reforms ronald reagan fired by general electric for criticizing tva when democrats after  proclaimed the tennessee valley authority as a model for countries in the developing world to follow conservative critics charged it was a topheavy centralized technocratic venture that displaced locals and did so in insensitive ways thus when the program was used as the basis for modernization programs in various parts of the third world during the cold war such as in the mekong delta in vietnam its failure brought a backlash of cynicism toward modernization programs that has persisted thenmovie star ronald reagan had moved to television as the host and a frequent performer for general electric theater during  reagan was later fired by general electric in  in response to his publicly referring to the tva tva being a major customer for ge turbines as one of the problems of big government some claim that reagan was instead fired due to a criminal antitrust investigation involving him and the screen actors guild however reagan was only interviewed nobody was actually charged with anything in the investigation in  us senator and republican presidential candidate barry goldwater was quoted in a saturday evening post article by stewart alsop as saying you know i think we ought to sell tva he had called for the sale to private companies of particular parts of the authority including its fertilizer production and steamgeneration facilities because it would be better operated and would be of more benefit for more people if it were part of private industry goldwaters saturday evening post quotation was used against him in a tv ad by doyle dane bernbach for president lyndon johnsons  campaign which depicted an auction taking place atop a dam it was voiced over as follows in a saturday evening post article
