for you that depends on a variety of factors including how long you want the policy to last how much you want your life insurance rates to be and whether you want to be able to withdraw money from the policy later term life insurance is suitable for most people permanent life insurance policies such as whole life and universal life usually contain a “cash value” account which builds value over time eventually you may have enough cash value to take a loan against it to use for large expenses such as college because permanent policies can be complex and expensive it’s best to have a financial advisor guide you through the options and costs here’s a deeper overview of types of life insurance term whole universal term life insurance pros it’s easy to understand and is the cheapest way to buy life insurance cons you could outlive your policy if you still need coverage you’d need to buy another policy and will pay more based on your age and possibly health you only have to make two decisions if you buy term life insurance what amount you want and how long you want the coverage to last “small” term life policies are available with under  in coverage but policy amounts can go into the millions term life is typically sold in lengths of five     and  years “level premium” term life means you’re locking in a price for the length of the policy typically you will pay a monthly or annual premium to keep the insurance in force “annual renewable” term life is a oneyear policy that renews every year for a higher price » compare nerdwallet’s life insurance comparison tool whole life insurance sometimes called ordinary life insurance pros it covers you for your entire life everything in the policy is guaranteed so there are no surprises cons it’s a very expensive way to buy life insurance whole life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance meaning it doesn’t expire it’s the closest thing to “set it and forget it” life insurance as long as you pay the bill you don’t have to think much about the policy your payments stay the same you get a guaranteed rate of return on the “cash value” investment component of the policy and the death benefit amount doesn’t change universal life insurance guaranteed indexed variable guaranteed universal life insurance gul pros it’s cheaper than whole life and other forms of universal life insurance you can choose the age to which you want the death benefit guaranteed such as  or  cons every payment must be made on time or you could lose the guarantee and forfeit the policy thereby losing all your previous payments the policy may have little or no cash value guaranteed universal life insurance offers insurance at a cheaper price than other permanent life insurance products the policies promise a certain death benefit and payments that don’t change there’s typically little or no cash value within the policy and insurers demand ontime payments missing a payment could mean you forfeit the policy and since there’s no cash value in the policy you’d walk away with nothing if you forfeit if you are sometimes late with bills this is not the product for you in addition consider that future financial or health problems could cause you to miss a payment indexed universal life insurance iul pros you can access cash value which grows over time the cash value is linked to a stock market index so if the stock market goes up you get some upside too within limits your payments and death benefit amount are flexible cons your cash value doesn’t take full advantage of stock market gains you should understand the policy’s fees participation rates and the ceiling on your return called a cap before you buy indexed universal life insurance links the cash value component of the policy to a stock market index like the sp  your gains are determined by a formula which is outlined in the policy the policy will dictate how much your cash value “participates” in any gains for example if your participation rate is  and the sp  goes up  you get an  return fortunately if the index goes down you won’t lose cash value you’ll just get zero rate of return some policies offer a small guaranteed interest rate in case the market goes down your gains in cash value will also be limited by your “cap” which is the maximum you’ll get no matter how high the market goes for example a cap might be  if the index goes up  and your cap is  you still get only  and remember only a portion of your payments are going into the cash value to begin with there are additional moving parts to keep track of such as your payments and death benefit within limits you can decrease your premiums or skip a payment as long as your cash value covers the insurance costs you need to keep track of this if you’re skipping payments and you don’t have enough cash value to cover costs your policy could lapse some policies allow you to adjust your death benefit too as your family’s needs change variable universal life insurance vul and variable life insurance vl pros there’s a chance for a large potential gain in cash value if your investment choices do well a policy owner can take partial withdrawals from cash value or loans against it cons it requires you to be handson in managing your policy the cash value changes every day based on the market lots of fees and administrative charges are deducted from your payment before anything goes to cash value with variable universal life and variable life insurance you tie your cash value to investment accounts such as bonds or money market and equity accounts there can be high risk to the investment account value based on the market but if you do have cash value you can take partial withdrawals or loans against it you can also vary your premium payments within certain minimums and maximums and vary the death benefit the “policy illustrations” shown to potential customers can be complex and optimistic but if you’re considering a policy like this a feeonly financial advisor who doesn’t earn commissions based on policy sales can help you sort it out comparison of types of life insurance featureterm lifewhole lifeuniversal life details vary for universal life policies regarding premium flexibility and death benefit flexibility choices in policy length✓ builds cash value ✓✓ premium payments may be flexible✓ death benefit amount may be flexible✓ most affordable way to buy life insurance✓ cash value can usually be linked to investments✓ types of underwriting for life insurance policies you may hear some other words that sound like additional types of life insurance but they’re really about how the policy is “underwritten” meaning how the life insurance companies will determine how much of a “risk” you are fully underwritten life insurance a life insurance medical exam is often required the application will also generally include many questions about your health your family’s health history your lifestyle such as hobbies like skydiving and your plans for travel outside the united states this “full underwriting” allows the insurance company to most accurately price the policy based on your life expectancy if you are healthy — or even if you have a couple health issues — this will generally be the cheapest way to buy life insurance simplified issue life insurance no life insurance medical exam is required but you will be asked a few health questions and you could be turned down based on your answers guaranteed issue life insurance there’s no medical exam and no questions asked you can’t be turned down this is the most expensive way to buy life insurance and you might find only low coverage amounts available such as  or  in addition if you die within the first few years of having the policy your beneficiaries may receive only a partial death benefit or a check for the premiums you paid people often buy these policies when they’ve been turned down elsewhere but they want to cover final expenses such as funeral costs there are also types of life insurance meant for specific situations mortgage life insurance covers specifically the current balance of your mortgage and pays out to the lender not your family if you die credit life insurance covers only the balance of a specific loan like a home equity loan your bank might offer to sell you a credit life insurance policy when you take out a loan if you die it pays off the lender not your family accidental death and dismemberment add pays a death benefit only if you die accidentally such as in a car crash accidental death and dismemberment policies also offer insurance payouts for loss of limbs sight and hearing and other problems joint life insurance this type of permanent life insurance insures two lives usually spouses under one policy and comes in two forms firsttodie pays out upon the death of the first person whichever one it is the surviving spouse would typically be the beneficiary the policy would then expire it doesn’t continue to cover the second person secondtodie pays out when both people have died a policy like this is typically used when heirs such as children will need money to pay estate or

otherwise indicated all other information included in the prospectus remains unchanged and the prospectus is hereby incorporated by reference the terms and section headings we use in this supplement have the same meaning as in the prospectus we will send you another copy of any prospectus or supplement without charge upon request please contact the customer service group referenced in the prospectus   this supplement describes a new lump sum payment option guaranteed benefit lump sum payment which is currently available under limited circumstances as an alternative to receiving periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the guaranteed minimum income benefit option please be advised that electing the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment is completely voluntary and you are not required take any action at this time under your contract    the following is added after the last paragraph under guaranteed benefit offers in contract features and benefits   guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option   the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option is currently available under limited circumstances it is available to you if you elected a guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib and the nolapse guarantee is in effect and your account value falls to zero either due to a withdrawal that is not an excess withdrawal or due to a deduction of charges   we reserve the right to terminate the availability of this option at any time this option is not available under rollover tsa contracts   if your account value falls to zero as described above we will send you a letter which will describe the options available to you including the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option to make your election in addition the letter will include the following information      the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer is optional      if no action is taken you will receive the stream of payments as promised under your contract      the amount and frequency of the stream of payments      the amount you would receive if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer      that the amount of the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer is less than the present value of the stream of payments      a description of the factors you should consider before accepting the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer and      the reason we are making the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer   you will have no less than  days from the day your account value falls to zero to elect an option if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option you will receive the lump sum amount in a single payment   if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment your contract and optional benefits will terminate if you do not make an election we will automatically exercise your gmib by issuing a supplementary annuity contract using the default option described in your contract   we will determine the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment amount as of the day your account value fell to zero the amount of a guaranteed benefit lump sum payment will vary based on the factors described below   we first determine the contract reserves attributable to your contract using standard actuarial calculations which is a conservative measurement of present value in general the contract reserve is the present value of future benefit payments in determining your contract reserve we take into account the following factors        the ownerannuitants life expectancy based on gender and age        the current annual payment for the gmib in the form of a single life annuity adjusted for any outstanding withdrawal charge and        the interest rate at the time your account value fell to zero     im    catalog no   accumulator  inforce    the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment is calculated based on a percentage of the computed contract reserve we will use the percentage that is in effect at the time of your election the percentage will range from  to  of the contract reserve if your account value falls to zero as described above we will notify you then of the current percentage when we send you the letter describing the options available to you your payment will be reduced as applicable by any annual payments made under a customized payment plan or maximum payment plan since your account value fell to zero for information on how the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option works under certain hypothetical circumstances please see appendix a   in the event your account falls to zero as described above you should evaluate this payment option carefully if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option you would no longer have the ability to receive periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the gmib when you purchased your contract you made a determination that the income stream available under the gmib was important to you based on your personal circumstances when considering this payment option you should consider whether you still need the benefits of an ongoing income stream given your personal and financial circumstances   in addition you should consider the following factors        whether given your state of health you believe you are likely to live to enjoy the future income benefits provided by the gmib and        whether a lump sum payment is more important to you than a future stream of payments   in considering the factors above and any other factors you believe are relevant you may wish to consult with your financial professional or other advisor   we believe that offering this payment option could be mutually beneficial to both us and to contract owners whose financial circumstances may have changed since they purchased the contract if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment

terms and section headings we use in this supplement have the same meaning as in the prospectus we will send you another copy of any prospectus or supplement without charge upon request please contact the customer service group referenced in the prospectus   this supplement describes a new lump sum payment option guaranteed benefit lump sum payment which is currently available under limited circumstances as an alternative to receiving periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the guaranteed minimum income benefit option or taking certain guaranteed withdrawals and keeping a guaranteed death benefit under the guaranteed withdrawal benefit for life option please be advised that electing the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment is completely voluntary and you are not required take any action at this time under your contract    the following is added after the last paragraph under guaranteed benefit offers in contract features and benefits   guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option   the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option is currently available under the following limited circumstances      if you elected a guaranteed minimum income benefit gmib and the nolapse guarantee is in effect and your account value falls to zero either due to a withdrawal that is not an excess withdrawal or due to a deduction of charges   or      if you elected a guaranteed withdrawal benefit for life gwbl or elected a gmib that converted to a gwbl and your account value falls to zero either due to a withdrawal or surrender that is not an excess withdrawal or due to a deduction of charges   we reserve the right to terminate the availability of this option at any time this option is not available under rollover tsa contracts   if your account value falls to zero as described above we will send you a letter which will describe the options available to you including the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option to make your election in addition the letter will include the following information      the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer is optional      if no action is taken you will receive the stream of payments as promised under your contract      the amount and frequency of the stream of payments      the amount you would receive if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer      that the amount of the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer is less than the present value of the stream of payments      a description of the factors you should consider before accepting the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer and      the reason we are making the guaranteed benefit lump sum offer   you will have no less than  days from the day your account value falls to zero to elect an option if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option you will receive the lump sum amount in a single payment   if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment your contract and optional benefits will terminate if you do not make an election we will automatically exercise your gmib by issuing a supplementary annuity contract using the default option described in your contract in the case of the gwbl we will issue you a supplementary life annuity contract and any of the applicable benefits will continue   we will determine the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment amount as of the day your account value fell to zero the amount of a guaranteed benefit lump sum payment will vary based on the factors described below     im    catalog no   accumulator     inforce    we first determine the contract reserves attributable to your contract using standard actuarial calculations which is a conservative measurement of present value in general the contract reserve is the present value of future benefit payments in determining your contract reserve we take into account the following factors        the ownerannuitants life expectancy based on gender and age        the current annual payment for the gmib adjusted for any outstanding withdrawal charge or in the case of the gwbl the guaranteed annual withdrawal amount in the form of a single life annuity        the interest rate at the time your account value fell to zero and        any remaining guaranteed minimum death benefit under the gwbl feature   the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment is calculated based on a percentage of the computed contract reserve we will use the percentage that is in effect at the time of your election the percentage will range from  to  of the contract reserve if your account value falls to zero as described above we will notify you then of the current percentage when we send you the letter describing the options available to you your payment will be reduced as applicable by any annual payments made under a customized payment plan or maximum payment plan since your account value fell to zero for information on how the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option works under certain hypothetical circumstances please see appendix a   in the event your account falls to zero as described above you should evaluate this payment option carefully if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option you would no longer have the ability to receive periodic cash payments over your lifetime under the gmib andor the opportunity to take certain guaranteed withdrawals and keep any level of guaranteed death benefit under the gwbl when you purchased your contract you made a determination that the income stream available under the gmib or the gwbl was important to you based on your personal circumstances when considering this payment option you should consider whether you still need the benefits of an ongoing income stream given your personal and financial circumstances   in addition you should consider the following factors        whether given your state of health you believe you are likely to live to enjoy the future income benefits provided by the gmib or the gwbl        if you have the gwbl whether it is important for you to leave a minimum death benefit to your beneficiaries if still in effect and        whether a lump sum payment is more important to you than a future stream of payments   in considering the factors above and any other factors you believe are relevant you may wish to consult with your financial professional or other advisor   we believe that offering this payment option could be mutually beneficial to both us and to contract owners whose financial circumstances may have changed since they purchased the contract if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option you would benefit since you would immediately receive a lump sum payment rather than a stream of future payments over your lifetime we would gain a financial benefit because we anticipate that providing a lump sum payment to you will be less costly to us than paying you periodic cash payments during your lifetime   if you elect the guaranteed benefit lump sum payment option

of life insurance is best for you that depends on a variety of factors including how long you want the policy to last how much you want your life insurance rates to be and whether you want to be able to withdraw money from the policy later term life insurance is suitable for most people permanent life insurance policies such as whole life and universal life usually contain a “cash value” account which builds value over time eventually you may have enough cash value to take a loan against it to use for large expenses such as college because permanent policies can be complex and expensive it’s best to have a financial advisor guide you through the options and costs here’s a deeper overview of types of life insurance term whole universal term life insurance pros it’s easy to understand and is the cheapest way to buy life insurance cons you could outlive your policy if you still need coverage you’d need to buy another policy and will pay more based on your age and possibly health you only have to make two decisions if you buy term life insurance what amount you want and how long you want the coverage to last “small” term life policies are available with under  in coverage but policy amounts can go into the millions term life is typically sold in lengths of five     and  years “level premium” term life means you’re locking in a price for the length of the policy typically you will pay a monthly or annual premium to keep the insurance in force “annual renewable” term life is a oneyear policy that renews every year for a higher price » compare nerdwallet’s life insurance comparison tool whole life insurance sometimes called ordinary life insurance pros it covers you for your entire life everything in the policy is guaranteed so there are no surprises cons it’s a very expensive way to buy life insurance whole life insurance is a form of permanent life insurance meaning it doesn’t expire it’s the closest thing to “set it and forget it” life insurance as long as you pay the bill you don’t have to think much about the policy your payments stay the same you get a guaranteed rate of return on the “cash value” investment component of the policy and the death benefit amount doesn’t change universal life insurance guaranteed indexed variable guaranteed universal life insurance gul pros it’s cheaper than whole life and other forms of universal life insurance you can choose the age to which you want the death benefit guaranteed such as  or  cons every payment must be made on time or you could lose the guarantee and forfeit the policy thereby losing all your previous payments the policy may have little or no cash value guaranteed universal life insurance offers insurance at a cheaper price than other permanent life insurance products the policies promise a certain death benefit and payments that don’t change there’s typically little or no cash value within the policy and insurers demand ontime payments missing a payment could mean you forfeit the policy and since there’s no cash value in the policy you’d walk away with nothing if you forfeit if you are sometimes late with bills this is not the product for you in addition consider that future financial or health problems could cause you to miss a payment indexed universal life insurance iul pros you can access cash value which grows over time the cash value is linked to a stock market index so if the stock market goes up you get some upside too within limits your payments and death benefit amount are flexible cons your cash value doesn’t take full advantage of stock market gains you should understand the policy’s fees participation rates and the ceiling on your return called a cap before you buy indexed universal life insurance links the cash value component of the policy to a stock market index like the sp  your gains are determined by a formula which is outlined in the policy the policy will dictate how much your cash value “participates” in any gains for example if your participation rate is  and the sp  goes up  you get an  return fortunately if the index goes down you won’t lose cash value you’ll just get zero rate of return some policies offer a small guaranteed interest rate in case the market goes down your gains in cash value will also be limited by your “cap” which is the maximum you’ll get no matter how high the market goes for example a cap might be  if the index goes up  and your cap is  you still get only  and remember only a portion of your payments are going into the cash value to begin with there are additional moving parts to keep track of such as your payments and death benefit within limits you can decrease your premiums or skip a payment as long as your cash value covers the insurance costs you need to keep track of this if you’re skipping payments and you don’t have enough cash value to cover costs your policy could lapse some policies allow you to adjust your death benefit too as your family’s needs change variable universal life insurance vul and variable life insurance vl pros there’s a chance for a large potential gain in cash value if your investment choices do well a policy owner can take partial withdrawals from cash value or loans against it cons it requires you to be handson in managing your policy the cash value changes every day based on the market lots of fees and administrative charges are deducted from your payment before anything goes to cash value with variable universal life and variable life insurance you tie your cash value to investment accounts such as bonds or money market and equity accounts there can be high risk to the investment account value based on the market but if you do have cash value you can take partial withdrawals or loans against it you can also vary your premium payments within certain minimums and maximums and vary the death benefit the “policy illustrations” shown to potential customers can be complex and optimistic but if you’re considering a policy like this a feeonly financial advisor who doesn’t earn commissions based on policy sales can help you sort it out comparison of types of life insurance featureterm lifewhole lifeuniversal life details vary for universal life policies regarding premium flexibility and death benefit flexibility choices in policy length✓ builds cash value ✓✓ premium payments may be flexible✓ death benefit amount may be flexible✓ most affordable way to buy life insurance✓ cash value can usually be linked to investments✓ types of underwriting for life insurance policies you may hear some other words that sound like additional types of life insurance but they’re really about how the policy is “underwritten” meaning how the life insurance companies will determine how much of a “risk” you are fully underwritten life insurance a life insurance medical exam is often required the application will also generally include many questions about your health your family’s health history your lifestyle such as hobbies like skydiving and your plans for travel outside the united states this “full underwriting” allows the insurance company to most accurately price the policy based on your life expectancy if you are healthy — or even if you have a couple health issues — this will generally be the cheapest way to buy life insurance simplified issue life insurance no life insurance medical exam is required but you will be asked a few health questions and you could be turned down based on your answers guaranteed issue life insurance there’s no medical exam and no questions asked you can’t be turned down this is the most expensive way to buy life insurance and you might find only low coverage amounts available such as  or  in addition if you die within the first few years of having the policy your beneficiaries may receive only a partial death benefit or a check for the premiums you paid people often buy these policies when they’ve been turned down elsewhere but they want to cover final expenses such as funeral costs there are also types of life insurance meant for specific situations mortgage life insurance covers specifically the current balance of your mortgage and pays out to the lender not your family if you die credit life insurance covers only the balance of a specific loan like a home equity loan your bank might offer to sell you a credit life insurance policy when you take out a loan if you die it pays off the lender not your family accidental death and dismemberment add pays a death benefit only if you die accidentally such as in a car crash accidental death and dismemberment policies also offer insurance payouts for loss of limbs sight and hearing and other problems joint life insurance this type of permanent life insurance insures two lives usually spouses under one policy and comes in two forms firsttodie pays out upon the death of the first person whichever one it is the surviving spouse would typically be the beneficiary the policy would then expire it doesn’t continue to cover the second person secondtodie pays out when both people have died a policy like this is typically used when heirs such as children will need money to pay estate or inheritance taxes so that they don’t have to sell off assets amy danise is an editor at nerdwallet a personal finance website email adanisenerdwalletcom twitter amydanise image via
