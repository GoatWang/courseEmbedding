keeping your finger on the pulse of school improvement  year  print only   related events cfo of the year cto of the year women of influence top honoree public companies when the economy went south in  the executive management team at first merchants corp—central indiana’s largest financial services holding company with a presence in  indiana counties and two in ohio—decided to do some very personal handholding with the firm’s roughly  employees instead of sending written memos about the company’s condition they delivered the news inperson via “town hall meetings” cfo mark k hardwick was present for all of them “we aggressively leaned into the challenges before us and took immediate actions that were difficult but provided a framework for longterm success and corporate health” hardwick said age  family wife cathy daughter halie  son bryce  hometown dunkirk ind education bachelor’s degree in accounting and mba from ball state university cpa graduated from stonier graduate school of banking in  civic involvement president of the delaware county country club member of the union chapel united methodist church finance committee supports united way first choice for women the community foundation the youth opportunity center and ball state athletics hobbies supporting children’s athletic endeavors cycling golf the occasional minimarathon with his wife “our commitment to our highestperforming employees proven processes and stakeholder communications were keys to success as we emerged from the challenges of the great recession as a much stronger company” belt tightening and keeping a careful eye on the books didn’t just help hardwick’s bank weather hard times it also positioned it to reap rewards in  first merchants seems set to establish a new record for total net income which stood at  million through the first three quarters hardwick has overseen first merchants’ books since  when he signed on as corporate controller since then the bank has grown from managing assets of roughly  billion to more than  billion while the number of employees and locations has more than tripled first merchants with hardwick’s considerable input also acquired shelby county bank last february “our risk management practices afford us the confidence to feel that we are prepared for whatever the future brings” hardwick said “first merchants expects to press forward and provide its customers with a servicedriven alternative to the superregional bank competitors in indiana and ohio regardless of macro economic conditions” hardwick has been instrumental in his company’s slowbutsteady accumulation of assets in  he brokered a strategy in which the bank’s preferred stock was exchanged for trust preferred securities resulting in an aftertax gain of roughly  million besides creating a pile of cash the move also added several strong institutional bank stock investors to first merchants’ shareholder base and in  hardwick was instrumental both in raising  million in a direct private placement of the bank’s common stock and repaying the company’s tarp obligation in full to improve first merchants’ efficiency hardwick also helped consolidate all affiliate bank charters into merchants’ single remaining fullservice bank charter though the task was handled with minimal disruption to customers the heavy lifting required to execute the project wasn’t too different in scale and complexity from that of a bank acquisition such work is essential in an industry where the rule “go big or go home” is in full force during the past  years the number of us banks has shrunk from roughly  to  with the largest  increasing their market share from  percent to  percent so for hardwick and first merchants the writing is on the wall grow or die “our industry is one that truly captures financial economies of scale so we anticipate consolidation to continue” hardwick said “we expect to accelerate our growth both organically and through acquisition we are planning to excel despite increasing regulatory requirements like doddfrank and basel iii’s increasing capital standards to mention a couple” first merchants’ chairman of the board charles r schalliol said that one of hardwick’s biggest challenges is guiding the company through the tougher postfinancialmeltdown regulatory thicket “the responsibility is significant and everchanging in producing a safe and sound environment” schalliol said “with mark at the helm first merchants has increased its stock price nearly  percent in the last  months” nevertheless hardwick expects  to be another challenging year with national gdp in the  to  percent range a lot depends on us economic policies and whether the european union can get its tottering financial house in order but whatever comes he’s confident the bank can handle it•  click here to return to the cfo of the year landing page email tweet advertisement recent articles by sam stall entrepreneur a master of ‘creative
