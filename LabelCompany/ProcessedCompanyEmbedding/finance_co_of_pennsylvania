related risks and disclosure of portfolio holdings the business purposes of the company as set forth in its articles of incorporation are to own purchase and sell securities of business enterprises of any nature whatsoever to own hold use purchase and sell real and personal property of any nature whatsoever as principal and not as agent and to carry on the business of an openend investment company as defined under the provisions of the pennsylvania business corporation law as in effect on december   the company’s investment objective in carrying out its business as an investment company is to seek longterm appreciation of its shareholders’ capital further reference is made to item  of part b of this registration statement for a description of its investment policies the company invests primarily in common stocks and to a lesser extent fixed income securities it also invests in us treasury notes and bills and registered money market funds as a liquidity technique to cover redemptions and as a temporary investment pending a decision to redeploy the proceeds of securities that were sold the company may also invest in other registered investment companies and may write call options on securities it owns the authority to make alter amend or repeal these objectives is vested in the board of directors subject to the power of the stockholders to approve such action item  of part b identifies the investment policies of the company which require stockholder approval to change the board of directors of the company oversees the investment of its assets in order to preserve capital and produce income for the stockholders the board utilizes the services of cooke  bieler to provide recommendations with respect to the investment of a portion of its equity holdings cooke  bieler does not provide recommendations to the board with respect to several of the company’s holdings such as pnc financial services group inc exxon mobil corporation coca cola co fixed income securities the international and small cap mutual funds in which the company invests and the money market funds treasury notes and other short term investments used for the company’s liquidity needs such as redemptions dividends and taxes cooke  bieler’s style can be characterized as value oriented and thus the overall approach of the company to its equity portfolio may also be characterized as a value style the company has engaged the services of schroders to provide the daytoday investment management of the portion of the company’s assets devoted to fixedincome investments which are limited to investment grade fixedincome investments or their unrated equivalents as determined by schroders if an investment grade security is subsequently downgraded to noninvestment grade after purchase by the company the company may continue to hold such security in the discretion of schroders    table of contents schroders practices a durationneutral relative value fixed income discipline the term duration neutral means that the duration of the company’s fixedincome portfolio managed by schroders will generally resemble the duration of the barclays aggregate bond index the benchmark for the company’s fixedincome portfolio managed by schroders the “benchmark” relative value refers to schroders’ process of identifying the intrinsic value of a security based on certain characteristics eg credit quality premium and structure premium to determine a target yield for each security the target yield is then compared to the yield of a riskfree security ie treasury yield of a similar maturity relative value can be assessed versus the riskfree rate and both within and across sectors schroders’ team focuses its efforts on identifying attractive issues from the bottom up capitalizing on pricing inefficiencies identified through fundamental research the schroders team specifically avoids interest rate forecasting and sector rotation as they believe these techniques add no longterm value and cause unnecessary principal risk when fully invested the average effective duration of the company’s fixedincome portfolio managed by schroders will normally vary by no more than one year from the average effective duration of the benchmark the company does not engage in active trading on the contrary it makes a value judgment on the worth of an organization and tends to hold the security for the long term the board considers its investment approach to be generally conservative and thus the risks are those risks generally applicable to the equity and fixed income markets it has limited generally under  in the aggregate exposure to international securities and small cap securities which may involve more risks than the generally broad market also it has had a significant portion of its assets invested in pnc bank corp and exxonmobil corporation and thus is subject to the risks inherent in investing in banking institutions and oil and gas companies respectively and having a significant portion of its assets committed to two securities risks of nondiversification and focus on banking and oil and gas companies the company has held shares of pnc bank corp and its predecessors for over  years its holdings in pnc stock amount to approximately  of its portfolio and its holdings of exxonmobil amounted to approximately  of its portfolio each as of march   while the rest of its portfolio is diversified among various sectors the company is subject to the risk that the banking industry and financial services sector and oil and gas companies generally will underperform the broader market as well as the risk that issuers in those sectors will be impacted by market conditions legislative or regulatory changes or competition the company may also be more susceptible to changes in interest rates and other market and economic factors that affect financial services firms including the effect of interest rate changes on the share prices of those financial service firms in addition the company will be subject to the risks applicable to the oil and gas sector companies in the oil and gas sector will be affected by changes in worldwide energy prices and exploration and production spending adverse effects from changes in exchange rates government regulation eg higher taxes or other regulatory actions that increase costs world events economic conditions warmer winters and energy efficiency market economic and political risks of the countries where these companies are located or do business risk for environmental damage claims and risks related to terrorism equity risk since it purchases primarily equity securities the company is subject to the risk that stock prices will fall over short or extended periods of time historically the equity markets have moved in cycles and the value of the company’s equity securities may fluctuate drastically from daytoday individual companies may report poor results or be negatively affected by industry andor economic trends and developments the prices of securities issued by such companies may suffer a decline in response these factors contribute to price volatility which is a principal risk of owning shares in the company fixed income risk the market values of fixed income investments change in response to economic developments particularly interest rate changes as well as to perceptions about the creditworthiness of individual issuers including governments during periods of rising interest rates the values of outstanding fixed income securities generally decrease moreover while securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher yields the prices of longer maturity securities are also subject to greater market fluctuations as a result of changes in interest rates during periods of falling interest rates certain debt obligations with high interest rates may be prepaid or “called” by the issuer prior to maturity current market conditions may pose heightened risks for the company while the us is experiencing historically low interest rates recent changes in government policy including the federal reserve ending its quantitative easing program and raising the federal funds rate have increased the risk that interest rates will rise in the near future a rise in interest rates may in turn increase volatility and reduce liquidity in the fixed income markets and result in a decline in the value of the fixed income investments held by the company in addition reductions in dealer marketmaking capacity as a result of structural or regulatory changes could further decrease liquidity andor increase volatility in the fixed income markets as a result of these conditions the company’s value may fluctuate andor the company may experience increased redemptions from shareholders which may impact the company’s liquidity or force the company to sell securities into a declining or illiquid market in addition to these risks fixed income securities may be subject to credit risk which is the possibility that an issuer will be unable to make timely payments of either principal or interest international investment risk the company’s investments in securities of foreign issuers involve certain risks that are greater than those associated with investments in securities of us issuers these include risks of adverse changes in foreign economic political regulatory and other conditions or changes in currency exchange rates or exchange control regulations including limitations on currency movements and exchanges in certain countries legal remedies available to investors may be more limited than those available with respect to investments in the united states the securities of some foreign companies may be less liquid and at times more volatile than securities of comparable us companies the company may also experience more rapid or extreme changes in value as compared to a fund that invests solely in securities of us companies because the securities’ markets of many foreign countries are relatively small with a limited number of companies representing a small number of industries investment company risk when the company invests in an investment company in addition to directly bearing the expenses associated with its own operations it will bear a pro rata portion of the investment company’s expenses in addition while the risks of owning shares of an investment company generally reflect the risks of owning the underlying investments of the investment company the company may be subject to additional or different risks than if the company had invested directly in the underlying investments for example the lack of liquidity in an exchangetraded fund could result in its value being more volatile than the underlying portfolio securities closedend investment companies issue a fixed number of shares that trade on a stock exchange or overthecounter at a premium or a discount to their net asset value as a result a closedend fund’s share price fluctuates based on what another investor is willing to pay rather than on the market value of the securities in the fund options risk the company utilizes options strategies and therefore the company is subject to options risk an option is a contract between two parties for the purchase and sale of a financial instrument for a specified price at any time during the option period unlike a futures contract an option grants a right not an obligation to buy or sell a financial instrument for example an option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right in exchange for a premium to assume a position in a futures contract at a specified exercise price during the term of the option the seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically unlimited increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option the securities necessary to satisfy the exercise of the call option may be unavailable for purchase except at much higher prices purchasing securities to satisfy the exercise of the call option can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further sometimes by a significant amount thereby exacerbating the loss the buyer of a call option assumes the risk of losing its entire premium invested in the call option the seller writer of a put option that is covered eg the writer has a short position in the underlying security assumes the risk of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the sales price in establishing the short position of the underlying security plus the premium received and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security below the exercise price of the option the seller of an uncovered put option assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the exercise price of the option the buyer of a put option assumes the risk of losing his entire premium invested in the put option small and midcap risk small and midcap companies may be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic events than larger more established companies in particular small and midcap companies may    table of contents have limited product lines markets and financial resources and may depend upon a relatively small management group the securities of smaller companies are often traded in the overthecounter market and even if listed on a national securities exchange the trading market ie the volume of trades on any given day for such securities may be less active than larger companies listed on that exchange consequently the securities of these companies may be less liquid may have limited market stability and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than the securities of larger more established companies as a result the prices of the smaller companies owned by the company may be volatile value investing risk value investing focuses on companies whose stocks appear undervalued in light of factors such as the company’s earnings book value revenues or cash flow if the company’s investment adviser’s assessment of a company’s value or prospects for exceeding earnings expectations or market conditions is wrong the company could suffer losses or produce poor performance relative to other funds in addition “value stocks” can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time portfolio holdings a description of the company’s policy and procedures with respect to the circumstances under which the company discloses its

its last sale price on the day on which the determination is made or if no price is available the latest bid price is used securities listed on the nasdaq national market system are valued in accordance with the nasdaq official closing price securities traded overthecounter are valued at the mean of the latest available bid and asked prices fixed income securities are valued on the basis of prices provided by pricing services in determining the value of a particular investment pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such securities market transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between securities when valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days the company uses amortized cost which approximates fair value securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors    table of contents examples of when the company may fair value a security include when a security is delisted or its trading is halted or suspended when a security’s primary pricing source is unable or unwilling to provide a price when a security’s primary trading market is closed during regular market hours or when a security’s value is materially affected by events occurring after the close of the security’s primary trading market by fair valuing securities the company seeks to establish prices that the company might expect to realize upon the current sales of these securities however due to the subjective and variable nature of fair value pricing there can be no assurance that the company could obtain the fair value assigned to the security upon the sale of such security frequent purchases and redemptions of company shares the company does not sell its shares and therefore the board of directors has not adopted procedures with respect to frequent purchases and redemptions of company shares dividends distribution

not for another account additionally some of the accounts managed by portfolio managers have different fee structures including performance fees which are or have the potential to be higher or lower in some cases significantly higher or lower than the fees paid by the company this difference in fee structure may provide an incentive to the portfolio managers to allocate more favorable trades to the higher paying accounts to minimize the effects of these inherent conflicts of interest cb has adopted and implemented policies and procedures including brokerage and trade allocation policies and

between the investment strategy of the company and the investment strategy of the other accounts for example in certain instances a portfolio manager may take conflicting positions in a particular security for different accounts by selling a security for one account and continuing to hold it for another account in addition the fact that other accounts require the portfolio manager to devote less than all of his or her time to the company may be seen itself to constitute a conflict with the interest of the company a portfolio manager may also execute transactions for another fund or account at the direction of such fund or account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the company securities selected for funds or accounts other than the company may outperform the securities selected for the company finally if the portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account the company may not be

investment opportunities among accounts managed by them in an equitable manner over time    table of contents the structure of a portfolio manager’s compensation may give rise to potential conflicts of interest a portfolio manager’s base pay tends to increase with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets under management which indirectly links compensation to

value per share as next computed after receipt of such request in good order by the company payment for shares redeemed will be made typically within several days after receipt if in good order but no later than five working days after the valuation date shares are generally redeemed inkind at the discretion of the board of the company shares may be redeemed in whole or in part for cash in either event the redemption will be a taxable event to a shareholder and thus could result in a capital gain capital loss or in certain cases ordinary income to the shareholder the company will only distribute readily marketable securities which would be valued pursuant to the company’s valuation procedures when shares are redeemed in whole or in part inkind a shareholder will incur brokerage charges and other costs and may be exposed to market risk in selling the distributed securities shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the redemption in their particular circumstances the company has adopted a policy of meeting shareholder redemptions in whole or in part through the distribution of readily marketable securities the company may follow the practice of distributing selected appreciated securities to meet redemptions and may within certain limits use the selection of securities distributed to meet such redemptions as a tax efficient management tool by distributing appreciated securities the company can reduce its position in such securities without realizing capital gains since the company does not distribute its shares the distribution of portfolio securities also enables the company to avoid the forced sales of securities to raise cash for meeting redemptions a redeeming shareholder of the company who received securities would incur no more or less taxable income than if the redemption had been paid in cash the net asset value per share is computed by dividing the total value of the assets of the company less its liabilities by the total number of outstanding shares computations are made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles valuing each listed security at its last sale price on the day on which the determination is made or if no price is available the latest bid price is used securities traded overthecounter are valued at the mean of the latest available bid and asked prices securities for which quotations are not readily available restricted securities and other assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors the determination of a security’s fair value price often involves the consideration of a number of subjective factors and is therefore subject to the unavoidable risk that the value assigned to a security may he higher or lower than the security’s value would be if a reliable market quotation for the security was readily available securities listed on the nasdaq national market system are valued in accordance with the nasdaq official closing price fixed income securities are valued on the basis of prices provided by pricing services in determining the value of a particular investment pricing services may use

considerations generally affecting the company and its shareholders that is intended to supplement the discussion contained in the company’s prospectus no attempt is made to present a detailed explanation of the tax treatment of the company or its shareholders and the discussion here and in the company’s prospectus is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning in particular this summary does not address the tax considerations applicable to nonus shareholders in addition the company’s shares held in a taxqualified retirement account will generally not be subject to federal taxation on income and capital gains distributions from a company until a shareholder begins receiving payments from their retirement account all shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisors with specific reference to their own tax situations including their state local and foreign tax liabilities the following general discussion of certain us federal income tax consequences is based on the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code” and the regulations issued thereunder as in effect on the date of this sai new legislation as well as administrative changes or court decisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein and may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein qualification as a ric the company intends to qualify and will elect or has elected to be treated as a “regulated investment company” “ric” under subchapter m of the code by following such a policy the company expects to reduce the amount of federal taxes to which it may be subject the board reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of the company as a ric if it determines such course of action to be beneficial to shareholders    table of contents in order to be taxable as a ric the company must distribute annually to its shareholders at least  of the company’s net investment income generally net investment income plus the excess of net shortterm capital gains over net longterm capital losses less operating expenses and at least  of the company’s net tax exempt interest income for each tax year if any to its shareholders “distribution requirement” and also must meet several additional requirements among these requirements are the following i at least  of the company’s gross income each taxable year must be derived from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies and certain other related income including generally certain gains from options futures and forward contracts derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a qualified publicly traded partnership the “qualifying income test” ii at the end of each fiscal quarter of the company’s taxable year at least  of the market value of its total assets must be represented by cash and cash items us government securities securities of other rics and other securities with such other securities limited in respect to any one issuer to an amount not greater than  of the value of the company’s total assets or more than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer including the equity securities of a qualified publicly traded partnership and iii at the end of each fiscal quarter of the company’s taxable year not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or securities of other rics of any one issuer or two or more issuers that the company controls and which are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or the securities of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships the “asset test” if the company fails to satisfy the qualifying income test or the asset test in any taxable year the company may be eligible for relief provisions if the failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy the applicable requirements additionally relief is provided for certain de minimis failures of the asset diversification requirements where the company corrects the failure within a specified period if these relief provisions are not available to the company for any year in which it fails to qualify as a ric all of its taxable income will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders and its distributions including capital gains distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income dividends to its shareholders subject to the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders and lower tax rates on qualified dividend income for individual shareholders in addition the company could be required to recognize unrealized gains pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions before requalifying as a ric the treatment of capital loss carryovers for the company is similar to the rules that apply to capital loss carryovers of individuals which provide that such losses are carried over indefinitely if the company has a “net capital loss” that is capital losses in excess of capital gains for a taxable year beginning after december   a “post loss” the excess of the company’s net shortterm capital losses over its net longterm capital gains is treated as a shortterm capital loss arising on the first day of the company’s next taxable year and the excess if any of the company’s net longterm capital losses over its net shortterm capital gains is treated as a longterm capital loss arising on the first day of the company’s next taxable year the company’s unused capital loss carryforwards that arose in taxable years that began on or before december   “pre losses” are available to be applied against future capital gains if any realized by the company prior to the expiration of those carryforwards generally eight years after the year in which they arose the company’s post losses must be fully utilized before the company will be permitted to utilize carryforwards of pre losses in addition the carryover of capital losses may be limited under the general loss limitation rules if the company experiences an ownership change as defined in the code federal excise tax notwithstanding the distribution requirement described above which only requires the company to distribute at least  of its annual investment company taxable income and the excess of its exempt interest income but does not require any minimum distribution of net capital gain the company will be subject to a nondeductible  federal excise tax to the extent it fails to distribute by the end of any calendar year at least  of the company’s ordinary income for that year and  of the company’s capital gain net income the excess of short and longterm capital gain over short and longterm capital loss less any undistributed capital gains subjected to corporate level rates described below for the oneyear period ending on october  of that year plus certain other amounts the company intends to make sufficient distributions to avoid liability for federal excise tax but can make no assurances that such tax will be completely eliminated the company may in certain circumstances be required to liquidate the company investments in order to make sufficient distributions to avoid federal excise tax liability at a time when the investment adviser might not otherwise have chosen to do so and liquidation of investments in such circumstances may affect the ability of the company to satisfy the requirement for qualification as a ric    table of contents shareholder treatment the company receives income generally in the form of dividends and interest on investments this income plus net shortterm capital gains if any less expenses incurred in the operation of the company constitutes the company’s net investment income from which dividends may be paid to you any distributions by the company from such income will be taxable to you as ordinary income or at the lower capital gains rates that apply to individuals receiving qualified dividend income whether you take them in cash or in additional shares distributions by the company of its net shortterm capital gains will be taxable as ordinary income if the company were to be determined to be a nonpublicly offered registered investment company shareholders may be treated as receiving additional dividends equal to their share of the company’s affected expense and as having paid such expenses the company’s dividends that are paid to its corporate shareholders and are attributable to qualifying dividends it received from us domestic corporations may be eligible in the hands of such shareholders for the corporate dividends received deduction subject to certain holding period requirements and debt financing limitations generally and subject to certain limitations including certain holding period limitations a dividend will be treated as a qualifying dividend taxed at a current maximum rate to individuals of  if it has been received from a domestic corporation or certain foreign corporations all dividends including the deducted portion must be included in your alternative minimum taxable income calculation a dividend or distribution received shortly after the purchase of shares of the company reduces the net asset value of the shares by the amount of the dividend or distribution and although in effect a return of capital will be taxable to the shareholder if the net asset value of shares were reduced below the shareholder’s cost by dividends or distributions representing gains realized on sales of securities such dividends or distributions would be a return of investment though taxable to the shareholder in the same manner as other dividends or distributions the company intends to designate its net capital gains as “undistributed capital gains” which will be subject to tax at corporate rates the company’s shareholders will be required to include their shares of such undistributed amount into their income for federal income tax purposes as longterm capital gain shareholders will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the tax paid by the company on such undistributed amount against their federal income tax liabilities if any and to claim refunds on a properly filed us tax return to the extent the credit exceeds such liabilities for federal income tax purposes the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the company will be increased by an amount equal to the difference between the amount of undistributed capital gains included in the shareholder’s gross income and the tax deemed paid by the shareholder as described above if the company’s distributions exceed its taxable income and capital gains realized during a taxable year all or a portion of the distributions made in the same taxable year may be recharacterized as a return of capital to the shareholders a return of capital distribution will generally not be taxable but will reduce each shareholder’s cost basis in the company and result in a higher reported capital gain or lower reported capital loss when those shares on which the distribution was received are sold if the company declares a distribution to shareholders of record in october november or december of one year and pays the distribution by january  of the following year the company and its shareholders will be treated as if the company paid the distribution by december  of the first taxable year any gain or loss recognized on a sale exchange or redemption of shares of the company by a shareholder who is not a dealer in securities will generally for individual shareholders be treated as a longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than twelve months and otherwise will be treated as a shortterm capital gain or loss however if shares on which a shareholder has received a net capital gain distribution are subsequently sold exchanged or redeemed and such shares have been held for six months or less any loss recognized will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of the net capital gain distribution in addition the loss realized on a sale or other disposition of shares will be disallowed to the extent a shareholder    table of contents repurchases or enters into a contract to or option to repurchase shares within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after the disposition of the shares this loss disallowance rule will apply to shares received through the reinvestment of dividends during the day period in addition to the federal income tax described above us individuals with income exceeding   if married and filing jointly are subject to a  medicare contribution tax on their “net investment income” including interest dividends and capital gains including capital gains realized on the sale or exchange of shares of the company taxexempt shareholders under current law income of a ric that would be treated as unrelated business taxable income “ubti” if earned directly by a taxexempt entity generally will not be attributed as ubti to a taxexempt entity that is a shareholder in the ric notwithstanding this “blocking” effect a taxexempt shareholder could realize ubti by virtue of its investment in the company if shares in the company constitute debtfinanced property in the hands of the taxexempt shareholder within the meaning of code section b or if the company invests in real estate investment trusts that hold residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits “remics” or directly invests in residual interests in remics equalization accounting the company may use the socalled “equalization method” of accounting to allocate a portion of its “earnings and profits” which generally equals the company’s undistributed investment company taxable income and net capital gain with certain adjustments to redemption proceeds this method permits the company to achieve more balanced distributions for both continuing and redeeming shareholders although using this method generally will not affect the company’s total returns it may reduce the amount that the company would otherwise distribute to continuing shareholders by reducing the effect of redemptions of company shares on company distributions to shareholders however the internal revenue service irs may not have expressly sanctioned the particular equalization method used by a company and thus a company’s use of this method may be subject to irs scrutiny backup withholding the company will be required in certain cases to withhold at applicable withholding rates and remit to the united states treasury the amount withheld on amounts payable to any shareholder who  has provided the company either an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all  who is subject to backup withholding by the internal revenue service for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends  who has failed to certify to the company that such shareholder is not subject to backup withholding or  has not certified that such shareholder is a us person including a us resident alien tax shelter reporting regulations under us treasury regulations if a shareholder recognizes a loss of  million or more for an individual shareholder or  million or more for a corporate shareholder the shareholder must file with the irs a disclosure statement on form  direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement but under current guidance shareholders of a ric are not excepted future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or all rics the fact that a loss is reportable under

summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the company in the preparation of its financial statements the policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america portfolio valuation equity securities and exchange traded options that are listed on an exchange are valued at the last quoted sales price when valuing equity securities that are not listed on an exchange or have not traded the company uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day fixed income securities are valued on the basis of prices provided by pricing services in determining the value of a particular investment pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such securities market transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between securities when valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days the company uses amortized cost which approximates fair value it is the responsibility of the company’s board of directors the “board” to establish fair valuation procedures when valuing securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that are available are considered inapplicable the company determines a fair value in good faith in accordance with these procedures federal income taxes no provision has been

if any are paid quarterly distributions of capital gains if any are made at least annually and as required to comply with federal exercise tax requirements distributions to shareholders are determined in accordance with income tax regulations and recorded on the exdividend date equalization the company follows the accounting practices known as “equalization” by which a portion of the costs of redemption of capital shares equivalent to the amount on a per share basis of distributable investment income on the date of the transaction is charged to the undistributed income so that undistributed income per share is unaffected by company shares redeemed similarly on redemptions a pro rata portion of realized capital gains is charged against undistributed realized gains use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates investing in government sponsored agency securities the company invests in united states

the valuation technique inputs may be observable or unobservable observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the threetier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad
