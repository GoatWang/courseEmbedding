interest rate risks bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise the price of equity securities may rise or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a companys financial condition sometimes rapidly or unpredictably equity securities are subject to stock market risk meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time international investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the us can raise or lower returns also some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the united states and other nations investments in emerging markets can be more volatile real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry sector or geographical sector real estate investments may be subject to risks including but not limited to declines in the value of real estate risks related to general and economic conditions changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities particularly if the instruments involve leverage the value of commoditylinked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments use of leveraged commoditylinked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but at the same time creates the possibility for greater loss derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment the use of derivatives may not be successful resulting in investment losses and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns there is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investors exposure to domestic stock market movements capitalization sector swings or other risk factors investing using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates short selling involves certain risks including additional costs associated with

possibility of the advisor’s acquisition and the fund’s combination with another mutual fund but the board determined that the fund’s liquidation was in the best interests of the shareholders additionally as you the shareholder know the fund is not part of a larger fund complex it is a standalone fund that does not afford investors different investment opportunities making it less attractive to new investors finally increasing regulatory burdens and associated costs of operating mutual funds have made it very difficult for the fund to compete with larger funds that have the scale to manage these costs after careful consideration the advisor recommended liquidation to the board and the board concluded that liquidation was in the best interest of the shareholders prior to june   shareholders may continue to redeem their shares at their net asset value in accordance with the procedures set forth in the fund’s prospectus all shareholders will receive a package in the mail which will include this letter and a transaction request form with instructions on how to redeem their shares ira owners will receive this letter and an ira distribution form plus additional information regarding their redemption options all shares that are not redeemed prior to june   will be involuntarily redeemed at their net asset value on that date without any approval or action of shareholders we thank you for the time that you were a shareholder of the fund and remind you that we at northeast management and research company inc and our affiliated investment adviser northeast
