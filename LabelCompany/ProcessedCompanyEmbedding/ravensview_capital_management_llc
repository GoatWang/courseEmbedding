to its clients for a measured response to the dynamic and ever changing markets a focus on alternative investment assets eg commodities and alternative styles eg pairs trading gives a client’s portfolio the opportunity to zig when the market zags contact one man’s ‘magic’ is another man’s engineering robert a heinlein is it possible to have your investments less buffeted by the winds of change or to own a portfolio that ‘defies gravity’ in a falling market the short answer is yes constructing a portfolio to be insulated against wide market swings involves financial engineering and the application of economic theory financial engineering concepts are used by ravensview capital as a suite of tools and models to balance a client’s portfolio and build appropriate hedges by applying mathematics statistics and computational science economics as a science grounds the use of our financial engineering methods in well researched theories of behavior and markets applied economics as an art enters a realm of forecasting and statistical probabilities where the possibilities of both opportunity and risk can be explored ravensview capital seeks to best position a client for when theory meets reality when now meets the future the raven’s view the raven operates under the principle of “strategic opportunism” and so does ravensview capital the basic twofold premise behind professional arbitrage are the actions of positioning and striking an assessment of probabilities for both opportunity and risk allows the client’s portfolio to best be positioned to be able to strike with success and achieve arbitrage the watchful raven views it’s surroundings to be unusually well positioned and quick to strike when the target avails itself the raven is equally quick to take flight should the activity prove fruitless or excessively challenging ravensview capital actively manages it’s clients investments in a prudent manner that continually seeks opportunity while mitigating risk who said “there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch” actually that was both robert a heinlein and the economist milton friedman as a mountaineer in the cascade mountains joe eberhardt would notice that often when a climbing party would drop their backpacks and move even just ’ away or so ravens would appear first the ravens would quietly swoop into position nearby and view the climbers for a bit then emboldened by the absence of the climbers from their packs a raven would venture forward and begin to open a loose pack flap to be rewarded with someone’s sack lunch when the unfortunate climber returned to their pack they would find bits and pieces of the remains but no lunch though not exactly free and requiring some small work on the raven’s part the resulting arbitrage from positioning and striking was no less than professional and obviously the result of many successful past attempts tanstaafl disclosure warranties  disclaimers there are no warranties implied ravensview capital

about us   ravensview capital was formed in  to bring alternative and hedge fund investment styles directly to client portfolios it is our belief that a comprehensive portfolio that intimately uses these techniques is more effective and efficient than a simple inclusion of an allocation to a hedge fund past and pedigree nontraditional or alternative investments are generally a not well understood category of investing part asset allocation and part active management alternatives have the potential to boost a client’s portfolio and reduce its volatility the ravensview capital staff have extensive experience in energy trading and its primary commodities of oil and natural gas the growing area of renewable energy from wind and solar is also extremely well understood and this aids in evaluating master limited partnerships and similar resourcebased alternative asset classes additional areas of commodity experience include trading precious and industrial metals gold silver and copper alternative investment styles employed by the staff of ravensview capital have included primarily arbitrage pairs trading global macro convertible arbitrage and event driven merger arbitrage and special situations distressed securities new styles are continually being evaluated in paper portfolios and tested with real market orders prior to client placement financial engineering is an evolving multidisciplinary field that ranges from application of statistics and option theory to complex optimization models and big data analysis the use of these techniques in a client’s portfolio can be compared to fine tuning a race car engine the ravensview capital staff have built from scratch mathematical portfolio optimizers using the principles of modern portfolio theory as well as monte carlo simulators together these have been used to find efficient allocations of assets in light of both historical past shocks as well as potential future black swan events these methods are used to build superior client portfolios and stress test them future horizons include understanding the potential for machine learning and its application as a means to monitor predict and promote appropriate
