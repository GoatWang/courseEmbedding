by managing risk steady  slow growth trumps gambling with your lifes savings get rich slow cadinha  company is a registered investment management firm serving highnetworth individuals and institutions since  philosophy fiduciary feeonly tools customization history introducingglobal portfolio strategies more we don’t think like typicalfinancial advisers more before wealth comes a wealth of information    we aim for solid investment returns with a special emphasis on capital preservation to do so we employ a comprehensive common sense investment approach combining our “big picture” insight with a thorough security selection process our observations and insights on these issues have shaped our portfolio strategy asset allocation and risk controls since  bigpicture insight topdown analysis we have long observed that markets often fail to grasp the significance of important global factors that shape asset returns and risk prospects these factors include questions such as inflation or deflation cyclical or secular stimulus or austerity sometimes these factors highlight huge risks hiding in plain sight that few notice and act on like a mania in technology stocks excessive leverage in the financial system or a new illadvised policy from washington other times they offer insight on the opportunity for gains marrying our view of the macroenvironment with each client need is the critical function at cadinha  company and our defining difference interest rates interest rates are not just key to the income and price of a bond they are a key component in measuring the value of stocks and interest rate considerations often are global we study interest rates—and the topdown factors that shape them—to identify value and risks while it’s rarely possible to predict the shortterm direction of interest rates we believe that occasional policy changes among other things can significantly influence the direction of interest rates and thus the direction of stocks bonds and other asset classes inflation  deflation everyone knows that inflation means that prices increase for most of the goods and services we consume but inflation has even wider ramifications in regards to investing and financial risk management inflation is also the devaluation of our money and a key component of interest rates higher inflation usually means higher interest rates and deflation yes this is possible does the opposite like interest rates inflation is largely shaped by global fiscal and monetary policy—sometimes directly so inflation is also a key component of our stock analyses all things equal we prefer investing in companies with pricing power companies that can successfully raise prices can protect against inflation—and even benefit from it—over time taxes  regulation we closely monitor taxes and regulations because we know people respond to incentives and must adhere to rules changes in taxes—including income taxes capital gains taxes corporate taxes and others—directly influence returns changes in the tax code that favor one form of income like dividends over others like corporate bond interest will incentivize investors to sell the higher tax income and buy the lower tax one regulations not only dictate actions and behavior but can also be a valuable source of protection for certain assets and companies while being the bane of others in an era of increasing and changing regulation even global investors ignore washington at their peril growth while it’s important to focus on the growth of individual stocks we think it’s also important to keep an eye on economic growth—where it’s happening and why we care about where we are in the economic cycle and look for secular growth drivers including demographics productivity trade and policies to assess headwinds and tailwinds among regions and asset types within stocks professional investors like to label stocks as either “growth” or “value” we believe growth and value are inextricably linked—growth is a vital component of value we seek companies with both growth attributes and value prices monetary policy the influence of the world’s central banks has grown exponentially to the point that many are as powerful and influential as the governments they serve today central banks including the federal reserve have many policy objectives to fulfill including full employment growth low and stable inflation regulation and a virtually limitless mandate to print and erase money perhaps never before has the fed been so directly in control of interest rates and inflation and as influential in asset returns an almost natural business cycle has been increasingly replaced by a policy cycle and it isn’t difficult to ascertain its tailwinds and headwinds more difficult and important is identifying the risks and ramifications our topdown and bottomup insights combine to create a forwardlooking asset allocation strategy—one that’s poised for the perceived risks and opportunities ahead rather than based on past performance or conventional practices the final step involves you our client your cadinha adviser will work with you now and over time to customize our investment strategies and insights regarding financial planning money management and allocating the best investments for your individual needs stocks business model durable and profitable business model we look for understandable businesses to invest in that have high and consistent returns on equity and capital to go along with a solid longterm business plan stocks management honest and able management we look for talented management teams that think and act like owners we focus on a key function of management capital allocation or what management does with earnings stocks price a cheap or reasonable price price is always a key determinant to any investment’s return and risk prospects bonds rather than just seeking income by holding a large number of fixed income securities across maturities and among various issuers we seek total return income plus capital appreciation with a fixed income strategy based largely on our market views we choose bond maturities based on our interest rate views and issuers based on their credit quality and yield cash while most professional wealth managers eschew the idea of holding cash in client accounts cash is a constant investment consideration for us we will hold cash—sometimes in substantial amounts—to hedge against elevated risks holding cash also gives us increased power to seize compelling investment opportunities in the future other assets though we mainly invest in stocks and bonds from time to time our topdown work identifies investment opportunities in other asset types such as gold currencies and real estatebased securities we may invest in these types of assets to hedge perceived macroeconomic risks and provide portfolio diversification or to seek additional returns researchdriven investments bottomup analysis we rely on an intensive researchdriven process to identify liquid securities that meet our stringent criteria no matter what assets we choose to invest in we will

what was in his clients best interests harlan knew there was a better way from its very founding in  cadinha  company has been different and this wasnt an easy time to be different or to launch a company in  inflation was  the price of gold had doubled and the dow jones had risen just  points for the year but harlan had a vision a vision of a firm that would make investment decisions based on clients needs one that would understand macroeconomic trends in order to allocate assets based on where an investment was likely headed not where it had been an asset management firm that didn’t sell products but was valued for its wisdom today cadinha  company stands as a testament to the ideal that great success can come from putting client needs first clients stayed a number are thirdgeneration
