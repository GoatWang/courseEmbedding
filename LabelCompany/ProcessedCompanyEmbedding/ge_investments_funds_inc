of its portfolio principal investment strategies the fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a combination of us and foreign non us equity and debt securities and cash ge asset management utilizes information from its asset allocation committee to allocate the fund s assets across various asset classes in order to diversify the fund s holdings and to adjust the asset class weightings based on market and economic conditions the fund also seeks to provide attractive risk adjusted returns relative to the fund s three broadbased benchmarks by tactically adjusting its asset allocation among the underlying indexed strategies based on ge asset management s asset allocation decisions the fund s assets are managed by a subadviser that employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the desired broadbased indexes with respect to approximately  of its assets the fund seeks to track the investment performance of the standard  poor s  composite stock index  sp  index  andor the morgan stanley capital international all country world index exus  msci acwi exus index  the investment adviser determines the allocation between the two indexes which can vary over time and which can involve a full allocation to one index the sp  index represents the market capitalizationweighted index of stocks of over  large us companies which is widely used as a measure of the largecapitalization us stock market performance the msci acwi exus index represents the market capitalizationweighted index of stocks designed to provide a broad measure of stock performance throughout the world with the exception of us based companies the msci acwi exus index includes both developed and emerging markets the subadviser uses a replication indexing strategy to track the investment performance of the sp  index and the msci acwi exus index replication is an indexing strategy in which a fund invests in substantially all of the securities in a benchmark index in approximately the same proportions as the benchmark index with respect to approximately  of its assets the fund seeks to track the investment performance of the barclays us aggregate bond index which represents a market valueweighted index of taxable investmentgrade debt issues including government corporate assetbacked and mortgagebacked securities with maturities of one year or more the barclays us aggregate bond index is designed to represent the performance of the us investmentgrade fixedrate bond market the subadviser uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the bond portion of the fund s assets representative sampling is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities that collectively has an investment profile similar to a benchmark index the securities selected are expected to have in the aggregate investment characteristics based on factors such as market capitalization and industry weightings fundamental characteristics such as return variability and yield and liquidity measures similar to those of the benchmark index the fund might or might not hold all of the securities that comprise the benchmark index to a lesser extent the investment adviser may also allocate a portion of the fund s  ge investments funds inc prospectus may   assets to track the investment performance of the standard  poor s midcap  index  sp midcap  index  andor the russell  index when the investment adviser believes that these indexes can provide attractive relative returns the fund may hold cash or invest in money market instruments principally for the preservation of capital income potential or maintenance of liquidity the fund may also use exchange traded funds  etfs  and derivatives such as options futures options on futures interest rate swaps and credit default swaps to gain or hedge exposure to a certain type of broadbased index such as equity futures of a broadbased index as an alternative to investing directly in or selling the securities representing such index principal risks the principal risks of investing in the fund are securities market risk is the risk that the value of securities owned by the fund may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally a general downturn in the securities markets may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities negative conditions and price declines may occur unexpectedly and dramatically in addition the fund could be forced to sell portfolio securities at an inopportune time in order to meet unusually large or frequent redemption requests in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices for the securities passive strategy risk the fund allocates its assets among various asset classes each of which is managed using a passive investment approach attempting to track the performance of a particular unmanaged index of securities the ability of the fund to achieve significant correlation between the performance of each asset class of the fund and its corresponding index may be affected by changes in the securities markets changes in the composition of the index the timing of purchases and redemptions of fund shares and fees and expenses of the fund any performance better than the index would be unusual and temporary foreign investment risk is the risk that investing in securities of foreign nonus issuers may result in the fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of us companies due to smaller markets differing reporting accounting and auditing standards nationalization expropriation or confiscatory taxation currency blockages and political changes or diplomatic developments the costs of investing in many foreign markets are higher than the us and investments may be less liquid the risk of loss and volatility have increased over the past few years and may continue because of high levels of debt and other economic distress in various countries including some in europe attempted solutions such as austerity or stimulus measures and governmental regulation also may increase the risk of loss and volatility in securities markets currency risk is the risk that the dollar value of foreign investments will change in response to changes in currency exchange rates if a foreign currency weakens against the us dollar the us dollar value of an investment denominated in that currency would also decline interest rate risk is the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of changes in interest rates bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and generally decline when interest rates rise in recent periods governmental financial regulators including the us federal reserve have taken steps to maintain historically low interest rates it is possible there will be less governmental action in the future to maintain low interest rates or that governmental action will be less effective in maintaining low interest rates changes in market conditions and government action may have adverse effects on investments volatility and liquidity in debt markets and any negative impact on fixed income securities could be swift and significant potentially increasing fund redemptions and negatively impacting the fund s performance midcap company risk is that the risk of investing in securities of midcap companies could entail greater risks than investments in larger more established companies midcap companies tend to have more narrow product lines more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks as compared with larger companies as a result their stock prices may decline more significantly or more rapidly than stocks of larger companies as market conditions change smallcap company risk is the risk that investing in the securities of smallcap companies may pose greater market and liquidity risks than larger more established companies because of limited product lines andor operating history limited financial resources limited trading markets and the potential lack of management depth in addition the securities of such companies are typically more volatile than securities of larger capitalization companies credit risk is the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security or the counterparty of a derivatives contract or repurchase agreement is unable or unwilling or is perceived to be unable or unwilling to make timely payment of principal andor interest or to otherwise honor its obligations prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates issuers of debt securities may repay higher rate securities before their maturity dates this may cause the fund to lose potential price appreciation and to be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates allocation risk is the risk that ge asset management may not allocate assets of the fund among asset classes in an optimal manner if among other reasons it does not correctly assess the attractiveness of an asset class valuation risk is the risk that the portfolio securities that have been valued using techniques other than market quotations may have valuations that are different from those produced using other methodologies and that such securities may be sold at discounts to the values established by the fund  liquidity risk is the risk that the fund cannot readily sell securities within seven days at approximately the price at which the fund has valued them or at a favorable time or price during periods of infrequent trading illiquid investments may trade at a substantial discount and may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value emerging markets risk is the risk of investing in securities of governments or companies located in emerging market countries which primarily includes increased foreign investment risk emerging market countries may have unstable governments andor economies that are subject to sudden change and may also lack the legal business and social framework to support securities markets which tends to make investments less liquid and more volatile derivative instruments risk is a combination of several risks including the risks that  an investment in a derivative instrument will not correlate well with the performance of the securities or asset class to which the fund seeks exposure or which the fund seeks to hedge  a derivative instrument entailing leverage may result in a loss greater than the principal amount invested and  derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to counterparty risk as well as liquidity risk and the related risk that the instrument is difficult or impossible to value accurately the methodology the fund uses to establish the fair value of a derivative may result in a value materially different from the value obtained using an alternative methodology in addition changes in laws or regulations may make the use of derivatives more costly may limit the availability of derivatives or may otherwise adversely affect the use value or performance of derivatives it is possible to lose money on an investment in the fund and this risk of loss may be heightened if you hold shares of the fund for a shorter period an investment in the fund is not a deposit of any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  or any other government agency performance the bar chart and the average annual total returns table below provide

approximates their par value plus accrued interest the tender option may not be exercisable in the event of a default on or significant downgrading of the underlying municipal obligation and may be

risk exposure is determined primarily by its principal investment strategies which are described earlier in the summary section of this prospectus investments in the fund are not insured against loss of principal as with any mutual fund there can be no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment objective investing in shares of the fund should not be considered a complete investment program the share value of the fund will rise and fall one of your most important investment considerations should be balancing risk and return different types of investments tend to respond differently to shifts in the economic and financial environment so diversifying your investments among different asset classes such as stocks bonds and cash and within an asset class such as smallcap and largecap stocks may help to manage risk and achieve the results you need to reach your financial goals the stock and bond markets in the united states and internationally have experienced unprecedented volatility in recent years this financial crisis caused a significant decline in the value and liquidity of many securities despite gains in some markets after steep declines such as those experienced during certain periods of  negative conditions and price declines may return unexpectedly and dramatically in these types of situations it may not be possible to identify all significant risks and opportunities using past investment strategies or models the primary risks of particular investments are summarized below for more information about the risks associated with the fund please see the sai which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus allocation risk ge asset management may not allocate assets of the fund among asset classes in an optimal manner if among other reasons it does not correctly assess the attractiveness of an asset class assetbacked securities risk because assetbacked securities often are secured by the loans underlying the securities the fund may lose money if there are defaults on the loans underlying the securities such defaults have increased the risk for assetbacked securities that are secured by homeequity loans related to subprime mortgage loans especially in a declining residential real estate market assetbacked securities also may be subject to more rapid repayment than their stated maturity dates indicate due to changing economic conditions to maintain its position in such securities the fund may reinvest the reductions in principal amounts resulting from the prepayments yields on those reinvested amounts are subject to prevailing market rates because prepayments of principal generally increase when rates are falling the fund generally has to reinvest proceeds from prepayments at lower rates investments in assetbacked securities may also be subject to valuation risk credit risk the price of a bond is affected by the issuer s or counterparty s credit quality changes in an entity s financial condition and general economic conditions can affect its ability to honor financial obligations and therefore its credit quality lower quality bonds are generally more sensitive to these changes than higher quality bonds even within securities considered investment grade differences exist in credit quality and some investmentgrade debt securities may have speculative characteristics a security s price may be adversely affected by the market s perception of the security s credit quality level even if the issuer or counterparty has suffered no degradation in its ability to honor the obligation derivative instruments risk the fund s use of various investment techniques may involve derivative instruments such as forward contracts futures and options on futures options and swaps there is no guarantee that these techniques will work the fund may but is not required to use derivatives as a substitute for taking a long or short position in an underlying asset to increase returns or as part of a hedging strategy some derivatives have the effect of leverage on the fund meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the fund s performance and its rate of income distributions for a particular period of time the use of derivatives involves risks different from andor possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets potential losses from certain derivatives are unlimited derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value derivatives not traded on an exchange may be subject to counterparty risk ie the risk that a counterparty to a derivative transaction may be unable to fulfill its obligations there is also the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by the fund may not correlate with the fund s other investments which could impact fund performance the fund may choose not to invest in derivative instruments because of their cost limited availability or any number of other reasons deemed relevant by ge asset management and the portfolio managers responsible for managing the fund forward contracts risk the principals who deal in the forward markets are not required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade and these markets can experience periods of illiquidity sometimes of significant duration while the fund may enter into forward contracts to reduce currency exchange rate risks transactions in such contracts involve certain other risks therefore while the fund may benefit from such transactions unanticipated changes in currency prices may result in a poorer overall performance for the funds than if they had not engaged in any such transactions moreover there may be imperfect correlation between the fund s portfolio holdings of securities quoted or denominated in a particular currency and forward contracts entered into by the fund such imperfect correlation may cause the fund to sustain losses which will prevent the fund from achieving a complete hedge or expose the fund to risk of foreign exchange loss futures contracts risk when the fund uses futures contracts as a hedging technique because perfect correlation between a futures position and the fund position  ge investments funds inc prospectus may   that is intended to be hedged is impossible to achieve the desired protection may not be obtained and the fund may be exposed to additional risk of loss the loss that may be incurred by entering into futures contracts could exceed the amount of the premium paid and may be potentially unlimited futures markets are highly volatile and the use of futures may increase the volatility of the fund s net asset value additionally because of the low collateral deposits normally involved in futures trading a high degree of leverage is typical of a futures trading account as a result a relatively small movement in the price or value of a futures contract increases the risk of losing more than the amount initially invested by the fund furthermore exchanges may limit fluctuations in futures contract prices during a trading session by imposing a maximum permissible price movement on each futures contract the fund may be disadvantaged if it is prohibited from executing a trade outside the daily permissible price movement futures contracts executed on foreign exchanges may not be provided the same protections as provided by us exchanges options risk writing and purchasing call and put options are highly specialized activities and entail greater than ordinary investment risks although options are intended to enable the fund to manage market and interest rate risks these investments can be highly volatile and the fund s use of them could result in poorer investment performance if the fund purchases options it is subject to the risk of a complete loss of the amounts paid as premiums to purchase the options unusual market conditions or the lack of a ready market for any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund s option strategies and for these and other reasons the fund s option strategies may not reduce the fund s volatility to the extent desired interest rate swaps and credit default swaps risk the use of swaps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions if a portfolio manager is incorrect in forecasting interest rates and uses interest rate swaps the investment performance of the fund may be adversely impacted due to the use of such swaps if the fund is a buyer of a credit default swap and no event of default occurs the fund will not earn any return on its investment if the fund is a seller of a credit default swap the fund s risk of loss may be the entire notional amount of the swap swaps may also subject the fund to the risk that the counterparty to the transaction may not fulfill its obligations emerging markets risk emerging market securities bear various foreign investment risks discussed below in addition there are greater risks involved in investing in emerging markets compared to developed foreign markets specifically the economic structures in emerging market countries are less diverse and mature than those in developed countries and their political systems are less stable investments in emerging market countries may be affected by national policies that restrict foreign investment emerging market countries may have less developed legal structures and the small size of their securities markets and low trading volumes can make investments illiquid and more volatile than investments in developed countries investing in emerging market countries may require the fund to establish special custody or other arrangements before investing which may result in additional risks and costs to the fund foreign investment risk investing in foreign securities including depositary receipts or securities of us entities with significant foreign operations involves additional risks that can affect the fund s performance foreign markets particularly emerging markets may be less liquid more volatile and subject to less regulation than us markets there may be difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and it may take more time for transactions to clear and settle in foreign countries than in the us less information may be available about foreign issuers the costs of buying and selling foreign securities including tax brokerage and custody costs generally are higher than those involving domestic transactions the specific risks of investing in foreign securities include valuation risk and currency risk the values of foreign investments may be affected by changes in currency rates or exchange control regulations if the local currency gains strength against the us dollar the value of the foreign security increases in us dollar terms conversely if the local currency weakens against the us dollar the value of the foreign security declines in us dollar terms us dollardenominated securities of foreign issuers including depositary receipts also are subject to currency risk based on their related investments the fund is permitted to hedge against foreign currency risk but normally will not do so politicaleconomic risk changes in economic tax or foreign investment policies government stability war or other political or economic actions may have an adverse effect on the fund s foreign investments regulatory risk foreign companies often are not subject to uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards or to other regulatory practices and requirements common to us companies additional risks related to debt and economic conditions the risk of loss and volatility have increased over the past few years and may continue because of high levels of debt and other economic distress in various countries including some in europe attempted solutions such as austerity or stimulus measures and government intervention also may increase the risk of loss and volatility in securities markets government stripped mortgagerelated securities risk in addition to prepayment risk the yields on government stripped mortgagerelated securities are extremely sensitive to prepayment on the underlying mortgage loans a rapid rate of principal payments will reduce the yield to maturity on  more on strategies risks and disclosure of portfolio holdings more on risks interest only mortgagerelated securities and increase the yield to maturity on principal only mortgagerelated securities if the underlying mortgage loans experience greaterthan anticipated principal payments the fund may not fully recoup its initial investment in interest only mortgagerelated securities the market for such securities may be volatile and they are considered illiquid unless certain conditions are met investments in government stripped mortgagerelated securities may also be subject to valuation risk interest rate risk bond prices generally rise when interest rates decline and generally decline when interest rates rise the longer the duration of a bond the more a change in interest rates affects the bond s price shortterm and longterm interest rates may not move the same amount and may not move in the same direction in recent periods governmental financial regulators including the us federal reserve have taken steps to maintain historically low interest rates it is possible there will be less governmental action in the future to maintain low interest rates or that governmental action will be less effective in maintaining low interest rates changes in market conditions and government action may have adverse effects on investments volatility and liquidity in debt markets and any negative impact on fixed income securities could be swift and significant potentially increasing fund redemptions and negatively impacting the fund s performance substantial redemptions from bond and other income funds may worsen that impact dividend and paying and other types of equity securities also may be adversely affected from an increase in interest rates liquidity risk illiquid investments may be difficult to resell at approximately the price they are valued in the ordinary course of business within seven days when investments cannot be sold readily at the desired time or price the fund may have to accept a much lower price may not be able to sell the investment at all or may be forced to forego other investment opportunities all of which may adversely impact the fund s returns illiquid investments also may be subject to valuation risk mortgagebacked securities risk mortgagebacked securities that are collateralized by a portfolio of mortgages or mortgagerelated securities depend on the payments of principal and interest made by or through the underlying assets which may not be sufficient to meet the payment obligations of the mortgagebacked securities prepayments of principal which occur more frequently in falling interest rate conditions may shorten the term and reduce the value of these securities the quality and value of the underlying collateral may decline or default which has become a significant risk for collateral related to subprime mortgage loans especially in a declining residential real estate market further these securities generally are privately sold and may not be readily marketable particularly after a rapid decrease in value investments in mortgagebacked securities may also be subject to valuation risk municipal obligations risk municipal obligations are backed by the entities that issue them andor other revenue streams like other debt securities prices of municipal debt securities are affected inversely by changes in interest rates and by changes in the credit rating or financial condition of the issuer income derived from investments in municipal obligations typically is exempt from regular federal income tax but may be subject to state and local taxes capital gains from the disposition of municipal obligations are subject to tax in addition interest income on certain municipal obligations may be subject to federal corporate and individual alternative minimum taxes the municipal obligations market is volatile and may be significantly affected by tax legislative or political changes some municipal obligations are insured which is intended to guarantee the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal passive strategy risk the fund utilizes a passive investment strategy attempting to track the performance of an unmanaged indexes of securities the ability of the fund to achieve significant correlation between the performance of the fund or asset class of the fund and an index may be affected by changes in the securities markets changes in the composition of an index the timing of purchases and redemptions of fund shares and fees and expenses of the fund a fund employing a passive strategy will hold constituent securities of an indexes regardless of the current or projected performance of a specific security or a particular industry or market sector maintaining investments in securities regardless of market conditions or the performance of individual securities could cause the fund s return to be lower than if the fund employed an active strategy prepayment risk prices and yields of certain securities such as mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities assume the securities will be redeemed at a given time when interest rates decline such securities experience higher prepayments because the underlying mortgages or loans are repaid earlier than expected the fund s portfolio manager may be forced to invest the proceeds from prepaid mortgagebacked securities or assetbacked securities at lower rates which results in a lower return for the fund when interest rates increase such securities experience lower prepayments because borrowers are less likely to repay their loans this typically reduces the value of the underlying securities redemption risk the fund may need to sell its holdings in order to meet shareholder redemption requests the fund could experience a loss when selling securities to meet redemption requests if the redemption requests are unusually large or frequent occur in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices for the securities sold or when the securities the fund wishes to or is required to sell are illiquid the fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at its desired time or price illiquidity can be caused by a drop in overall market trading volume an inability to find a ready buyer or legal restrictions on the securities resale certain securities that were liquid when purchased may later become illiquid particularly in times of overall economic distress  ge investments funds inc prospectus may   repurchase agreements risk the fund may suffer a loss if the other party to the repurchase agreement transaction defaults on its obligations and could be delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the underlying securities the value of the underlying securities may decline while the fund seeks to assert its rights the fund could incur additional expenses in asserting its rights or may lose all or part of the income from the agreement restricted securities risk restricted securities including rule a securities may be subject to legal restraints on resale and therefore are typically less liquid than other securities the prices received from reselling restricted securities in privately negotiated transactions may be less than those originally paid by the fund investors in restricted securities may not benefit from the same investor protection requirements as publicly traded securities reverse repurchase agreements risk a reverse repurchase agreement involves the risk that the market value of the securities retained by the fund may decline below the price of the securities that the fund has previously sold but is later obligated to repurchase at a higher price under the agreement securities market risk is the risk that the value of securities owned by the fund may go up or down sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally a general downturn in the securities markets may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously although equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities negative conditions and price declines may occur unexpectedly and dramatically in addition the fund could be forced to sell portfolio securities at an inopportune time in order to meet unusually large or frequent redemption requests in times of overall market turmoil or declining prices for the securities stock market risk is the risk that the value of equity securities may decline stock prices change daily sometimes rapidly in response to company activity and general economic and market conditions certain stocks may decline in value even during periods when the prices of equity securities in general are rising or may not perform as well as the market in general stock prices may also experience greater volatility during periods of challenging market conditions such as the one that the market recently experienced additional stock market risk may be introduced when a particular equity security is traded on a foreign market for more detail on the related risks involved in foreign markets see foreign investment risk above bond market risk includes the risk that the value and liquidity of debt securities may be reduced under certain circumstances bond prices can change daily sometimes rapidly in response to issuer activity and general economic and credit market conditions bond prices can be volatile and there can be severe limitations in the ability to value or sell certain bonds including those that are of higher credit quality during periods of reduced credit market liquidity such as the one that the market recently experienced style risk securities with different characteristics tend to shift in and out of favor depending upon market and economic conditions as well as investor sentiment the fund may underperform other funds that employ a different style the fund also may employ a combination of styles that impact its risk characteristics examples of different styles include growth and value investing as well as those focusing on large medium or small company securities midcap company risk investments in securities of midcap companies may entail greater risks than investments in larger more established companies midcap companies tend to have more narrow product lines more limited financial resources and a more limited trading market for their stocks as compared with larger companies as a result their stock prices may decline more significantly or more rapidly than stocks of larger companies as market conditions change smallcap company risk investing in securities of smallcap companies may involve greater risks than investing in larger more established companies smaller companies may have limited product lines markets or financial resources their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volume than securities of larger more established companies in addition smaller companies are typically subject to greater changes in earnings and business prospects than are larger companies consequently the prices of small company stocks tend to rise and fall in value more than other stocks although investing in smallcap companies may offer potential for aboveaverage returns the companies may not succeed and their stock prices could decline significantly investments in smallcap companies may also be subject to valuation risk valuation risk portfolio securities may be valued using techniques other than market quotations under the circumstances described under calculating share value the value established for a portfolio security may be different than what would be produced through the use of another methodology or if it had been priced using market quotations portfolio securities that are valued using techniques other than market quotations including fair valued securities may be subject to greater fluctuation in their value from one day to the next than would be the case if market quotations were used in addition there is no assurance that the fund could sell a portfolio security for the value established for it at any time and it is possible that the fund would incur a loss because a portfolio security is sold at a discount to its established value disclosure of portfolio holdings ge asset management has adopted policies and procedures to protect the fund s portfolio information and to
