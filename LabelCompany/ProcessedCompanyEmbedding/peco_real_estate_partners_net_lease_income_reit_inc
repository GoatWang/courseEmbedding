from netlease real estate as spreads tighten turning attention to lodging selfstorage and europe jun     am by bruce kelly  zoom a nontraded reit heavyweight wp carey inc is carefully backing away from the sector that has long been its forte — netlease real estate — and is looking for opportunities in other sectors and other markets while registered reps and advisers continue to sell the current netleasefocused real estate investment trust managed by wp carey corporate property associates  the company has no plans in the immediate future to launch its next netlease reit cpa the netlease market is getting crowded and pricey analysts said as a result wp carey has become active in the lodging and selfstorage sectors as well as looking for opportunities in europe “wp carey management recognizes that there is a lot more competition in the netlease space for assets” said paul adornato reit analyst with bmo capital markets “this means that buying assets to fill up a netleasefocused fund may not be as attractive as in the past”under a triplenet lease the tenant is responsible for paying all operating expenses property taxes and insurance in traditional property sectors landlords bear the responsibility for most of those expenses netlease real estate has been one of the most popular sectors for nontraded reits since the credit crisis and real estate crash as real estate value fell and interest rates hit historic lows netlease reits offered investors steady returns and income in the form of  to  dividends wp carey nontraded reits are sold by the leading independent brokerdealer networks in the country including lpl financial commonwealth financial network and cetera financial group the company converted from a publicly traded holding company to a reit two years ago and currently has a market capitalization of  billionwp careys nontraded reits have boasted strong returns according to filings with the securities and exchange commission  cpa reits have posted average annual returns of  to  cpa  which merged with wp carey in  posted average annual returns of  over  years the netlease real estate sector has grown tremendously and accounted for  of the traded reit index at the end of last year according to a january report by green street advisors wp carey is not the only reit player backing away from the netlease real estate market american realty capital also is doing so — last summer it said it was no longer going to create and distribute nontraded netlease reits that was a few months before a related traded reit american realty capital properties inc said it was buying rival netlease reit cole real estate investments inc “a lot more capital is looking for netlease assets” mr adornato said “this has created what some investors see as somewhat of a bubble in the netlease marketthe threat of rising interest rates is also spooking some netlease investors “netlease properties have more bondlike characteristics than traditional property sectors” according to a green street advisors annual report from january “in particular netlease investments are longerduration assets compared to other real estate sectors due to longterm leases and flattish cash flows” wp carey has widened its range of nontraded reits beyond the cpa brand in  it introduced nontraded reit carey watermark investors inc which focuses on buying lodging properties and hotels last week the company registered with the securities and exchange commission for another such reit carey watermark investors  inc carey watermark is gaining ground with financial advisers and clients for the year through may it had about  million in sales and has raised  million in equity since its launch “the halt in netlease shows their investment discipline” said sheila mcgrath managing director with evercore partners adding that the company remains open to netlease investing because it could still do a follow up offering to cpa  “wp carey is saying we dont want to raise too much in net lease and we are considering other property types to add to the platform ” this is not the first time wp carey has pulled back from the netlease market in  company founder william carey decided to stop selling nontraded netlease reits“bill carey called it” said kevin gannon managing director with robert a stanger  co an investment bank “he said i cant make the math work anymore in the long term people will thank me ”according to stanger wp carey sold  million of nontraded reits in  all of which were net lease none the next year and reentered the market in  raising  million in equity the companys recent shift in sectors was a surprise he said “when carey first said it was doing a hotel reit i scratched my head but timingwise it was brilliant”“there is an evolution of our investment management strategy” said trevor bond wp careys chief executive in a recent interview “weve changed a lot in the past two years since we became a reit the evolution towards multiple products has been a long time in coming”along with hotels the company is focusing on real estate opportunities in europe and selfstorage he said the companys expertise in those areas came from earlier transactions in the netlease reits mr bond said “but it took us a while to learn how to swim outside the pool and we waited until we felt comfortable expanding the pool” he said wp carey has been “active sellers” in the netlease sector as properties have become more expensive he said “with respect to new opportunities weve gotten better growth and better opportunities in europe in the past couple of years we have weighted things slightly more towards europe its a big region and theres a lot of corporateowned real estate there thats where the growth is bill was a big internationalist and ive continued that trend”  comments what do you think view comments please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus recommended for you related stories are music
