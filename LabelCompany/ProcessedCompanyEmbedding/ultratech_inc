management systemultratech inc has a quality management system in place designed to consistently meet customer requirements in a costeffective and timely manner while continually improving our processes and procedures involved in the sheet metal fabrication process each job that enters our shop is treated with the same standard of inspection and care to ensure that it is made per print and then delivered to the customer on time and in good condition at the beginning of the inspection process each part is checked for compliance by our amada fabrivision optical inspection machine  this ensures that the part was cutpunched from the sheet within tolerance and that all features of the part are present as the part moves through the shop a “first piece inspection” will be done for each additional operation to ensure compliance parts that require multiple welds bends or types of hardware will have each individually checked any machined parts that may be present in a project will be checked for compliance by our optical comparator machine when a part reaches the end of the fabrication process it is put through a “final inspection” to double check tolerances aesthetic requirements and functionality if the customer insists on a more thorough inspection process we can provide a “first article inspection” or an as  type report at a cost in doing this we will provide reports of all dimensions balloon drawings paint certifications plating certifications material certifications or whatever else may be required by the customer to receive the traceability they need on their product if for whatever reason a customer is not satisfied with the final product they have received we are always willing to work with them to get it up to the standard they had expected engineeringour experienced engineering staff is happy to work closely with the customer to create the best product possible whether this means designing something from scratch providing feedback for a potential
