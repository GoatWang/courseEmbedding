b is lower than the last transaction rated by fitch while initial hard ce for the class c is higher and d notes is unchanged compared to those in the last transaction the initial ce is sufficient to withstand fitchs base case cumulative net loss cnl proxy of  for all classes of notes at each class respective loss coverage multiplestable portfoliosecuritization performance losses on cafs portfolio and  securitizations have remained below the peak levels seen in evolving wholesale market the us wholesale vehicle market wvm is normalizing following strong performance in recent years fitch expects increasing used vehicle supply from offlease vehicles and tradeins to pressure abs recovery rates leading to moderately higher loss rates fitchs analysis accounts for this risk by including periods of weak wvm performance in the derivation of its base case loss expectationstable origination underwriting and servicing fitch believes caf to be a capable originator underwriter and servicer for integrity of the legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of caf would not impair the timeliness of the payments on the securitiesrating sensitivitiesunanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case in turn it could result in potentially adverse rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of carmax auto owner trust  to increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that the notes display some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses that could lead to potential downgrades of up to two categories under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario
