the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities this began around  bc in assyria and babylonia later in ancient greece and during the roman empire lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations they accepted deposits and changed money archaeology from this period in ancient china and india also shows evidence of money lending activity the origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early renaissance italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like florence lucca siena venice and genoa the bardi and peruzzi families dominated banking in thcentury florence establishing branches in many other parts of europe one of the most famous italian banks was the medici bank set up by giovanni di bicci de medici in  the earliest known state deposit bank banco di san giorgio bank of st george was founded in  at genoa italy modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of london who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service in exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods the sealing of the bank of england charter  gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith the goldsmith paid interest on these deposits since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmiths customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking the promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmiths promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default thus the goldsmiths of london became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit the bank of england was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in  the royal bank of scotland

statutory definition of the term banker banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking section  interpretation although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated the business of banking is in many english common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above in other english common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business when looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting

different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals nonbanks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account banks can create new money when they make a loan new loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system the money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated in the united kingdom between  and  there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt the amount of money in the economy as measured by m in the uk went from £ billion to £ billion between  and  much of the increase caused by bank lending if all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from

customer base for the bank business modelsedit a bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customerscitation needed the bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities this difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance in the past  years american banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions first this includes the gramm–leach–bliley act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for onestop shopping by enabling crossselling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability second they have expanded the use of riskbased pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans this helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients these products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards they make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home however with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to

weighted banks in the economyedit seb main building in tallinn estonia see also financial system economic functionsedit the economic functions of banks include issue of money in the form of banknotes and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customers order these claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par they are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments this enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other it also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend backtoback on their own account as middle men credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers the improvement comes from diversification of the banks assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations however banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position asset liability mismatchmaturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans in other words they borrow short and lend long with a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues eg accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions eg withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources eg wholesale cash markets and securities markets money creationdestruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractionalreserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed bank crisisedit otp bank in prešov slovakia banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises these include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the great depression the us

usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customers order – although money lending by itself is generally not included in the definition unlike most other regulated industries the regulator is typically also a participant in the market being either a publicly or privately governed central bank central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes however in some countries this is not the case in the uk for example the financial services authority licenses banks and some commercial banks such as the bank of scotland issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the bank of england the uk governments central bank banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account the law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows the bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank the bank agrees to pay the customers checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customers account plus any agreed overdraft limit the bank may not pay from the customers account without a mandate from the customer eg a cheque drawn by the customer the bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customers account as the customers agent and to credit the proceeds to the customers account the bank has a right to combine the customers accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship the bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customers account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank the bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customers account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the banks interests require it or the law demands it the bank must not close a customers account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days these implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank the statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms andor create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bankcustomer relationship some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules the

banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators all banks with fdicinsured deposits have the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a regulator however for soundness examinations ie whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the federal reserve is the primary federal regulator for fedmember state banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the primary federal regulator for national banks and the office of thrift supervision or ots is the primary federal regulator for thrifts state nonmember banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the fdic national banks have one primary regulator – the occ each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec was established in  as a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions although the ffiec has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing in addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the federal reserve fdic ots and occ offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut the remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator while banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks the impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less handson assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the united states the changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations it has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market a rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders the management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core while always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions safra national bank new york there are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times” the potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered in addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk banking is also an extremely competitive industry competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies credit unions cheque cashing services credit card companies etc as a reaction banks have developed their activities in financial instruments through financial market operations such as brokerage and have become big players in such activities loan activities of banksedit to be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed banks must compete for deposits the phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as us department of treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt one of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits to compete for deposits us savings institutions offer many different types of plans passbook or ordinary deposit accounts  – permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time now and super now accounts  – function like checking accounts but earn interest a minimum balance may be required on super now accounts money market accounts  – carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance certificate accounts  – subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity notice accounts  – the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal individual retirement accounts iras and keogh plans  – a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal checking accounts  – offered by some institutions under definite restrictions all withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons club accounts and other savings accounts  – designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals type of accountsedit suburban bank branch bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world under gaap there are two kinds of accounts debit and credit credit accounts are revenue equity and liabilities debit accounts are assets and expenses the bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance the customer debits his or her savingsbank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit when the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds the customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement if the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement brokered depositsedit one source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations this money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors it is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits this may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank banks which failed during  and  in the united states during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits there are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts globalization in the banking industryedit in modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk the growth in crossborder activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities however despite these reductions in barriers and growth in crossborder activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries in the usa for instance very few banks even worry about the riegle–neal act which promotes more efficient interstate banking in the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation one reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals on the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporations financial information is available around the globe see alsoedit types of institutions bad bank bankers bank building society cooperative bank credit union

liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities in addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards known as the basel accords banking in its modern sense evolved in the th century in the prosperous cities of renaissance italy but in many ways was a

among many other things the code of hammurabi from  bc recorded interestbearing loans banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities this began around  bc in assyria and babylonia later in ancient greece and during the roman empire lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations they accepted deposits and changed money archaeology from this period in ancient china and india also shows evidence of money lending activity the origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early renaissance italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like florence lucca siena venice and genoa the bardi and peruzzi families dominated banking in thcentury florence establishing branches in many other parts of europe one of the most famous italian banks was the medici bank set up by giovanni di bicci de medici in  the earliest known state deposit bank banco di san giorgio bank of st george was founded in  at genoa italy modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of london who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service in exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods the sealing of the bank of england charter  gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith the goldsmith paid interest on these deposits since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmiths customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking the promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmiths promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default thus the goldsmiths of london became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit the bank of england was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in  the royal bank of scotland established the first overdraft facility in  by the beginning of the th century a bankers clearing house was established in london to allow multiple banks to clear transactions the rothschilds pioneered international finance on a large scale

accounts for his customers paying cheques drawn on himher and collecting cheques for hisher customers banco de venezuela in coro branch of nepal bank in pokhara western nepal in most common law jurisdictions there is a bills of exchange act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments including cheques and this act contains a statutory definition of the term banker banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking section  interpretation although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated the business of banking is in many english common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above in other english common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business when looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the authority may prescribe for the purposes of this act banking act singapore section  interpretation banking business means the business of either or both of the following receiving from the general public money on current deposit savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than  months  or with a

direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument this has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties even if they do not pay and collect cheques  standard businessedit large door to an old bank vault banks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers paying cheques drawn by customers in the bank and collecting cheques

making advances to customers on current accounts by making installment loans and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending banks provide different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals nonbanks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account banks can create new money when they make a loan new loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system the money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated in the united kingdom between  and  there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt the amount of money in the economy as measured by m in the uk went from £ billion to £ billion between  and  much of the increase caused by bank lending if all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened

business modelsedit a bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customerscitation needed the bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities this difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance in the past  years american banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions first this includes the gramm–leach–bliley act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for onestop shopping by enabling crossselling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability second they have expanded the use of riskbased pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans this helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients these products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards they make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home however with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders

and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customers order these claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par they are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments this enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other it also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend backtoback on their own account as middle men credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers the improvement comes from diversification of the banks assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations however banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position asset liability mismatchmaturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans in other words they borrow short and lend long with a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues eg accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions eg withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources eg wholesale cash markets and securities markets money creationdestruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractionalreserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed bank crisisedit otp bank in prešov slovakia banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises these include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the great depression the us

governed central bank central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes however in some countries this is not the case in the uk for example the financial services authority licenses banks and some commercial banks such as the bank of scotland issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the bank of england the uk governments central bank banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account the law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows the bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank the bank agrees to pay the customers checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customers account plus any agreed overdraft limit the bank may not pay from the customers account without a mandate from the customer eg a cheque drawn by the customer the bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customers account as the customers agent and to credit the proceeds to the customers account the bank has a right to combine the customers accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship the bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customers account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank the bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customers account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the banks interests require it or the law demands it the bank must not close a customers account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days these implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank the statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms andor create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bankcustomer relationship some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules the requirements for the issue of a bank license vary between jurisdictions but typically include minimum capital minimum capital ratio fit and proper requirements for the banks controllers owners

banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators all banks with fdicinsured deposits have the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a regulator however for soundness examinations ie whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the federal reserve is the primary federal regulator for fedmember state banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the primary federal regulator for national banks and the office of thrift supervision or ots is the primary federal regulator for thrifts state nonmember banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the fdic national banks have one primary regulator – the occ each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec was established in  as a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions although the ffiec has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing in addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the federal reserve fdic ots and occ offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut the remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator while banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks the impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less handson assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the united states the changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations it has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market a rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders the management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core while always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions safra national bank new york there are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times” the potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered in addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk banking is also an extremely competitive industry competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies credit unions cheque cashing services credit card companies

banksedit to be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed banks must compete for deposits the phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as us department of treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt one of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits to compete for deposits us savings institutions offer many different types of plans passbook or ordinary deposit accounts  – permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time now and super now accounts  – function like checking accounts but earn interest a minimum balance may be required on super now accounts money market accounts  – carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance certificate accounts  – subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity notice accounts  – the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal individual retirement accounts iras and keogh plans  – a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal checking accounts  – offered by some institutions under definite restrictions all withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner unless the parent or guardian is required to do otherwise for legal reasons club accounts and other savings accounts  – designed to help people save regularly to meet certain goals type of accountsedit suburban bank branch bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world under gaap there are two kinds of accounts debit and credit credit accounts are revenue equity and liabilities debit accounts are assets and expenses the bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance the customer debits his or her savingsbank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit when the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds the customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement if the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement brokered depositsedit one source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations this money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors it is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits this may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank banks which failed during  and  in the united states during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits there are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts globalization in the banking industryedit in modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk the growth in crossborder activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities however despite these reductions in barriers and growth in crossborder activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries in the usa for instance very few banks even worry about the riegle–neal act which promotes more efficient interstate banking in the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation one reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals on the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporations financial information is available around the globe see alsoedit types of institutions bad bank bankers bank building society cooperative bank credit union

among many other things the code of hammurabi from  bc recorded interestbearing loans banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities this began around  bc in assyria and babylonia later in ancient greece and during the roman empire lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations they accepted deposits and changed money archaeology from this period in ancient china and india also shows evidence of money lending activity the origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early renaissance italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like florence lucca siena venice and genoa the bardi and peruzzi families dominated banking in thcentury florence establishing branches in many other parts of europe one of the most famous italian banks was the medici bank set up by giovanni di bicci de medici in  the earliest known state deposit bank banco di san giorgio bank of st george was founded in  at genoa italy modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of london who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service in exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods the sealing of the bank of england charter  gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith the goldsmith paid interest on these deposits since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmiths customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking the promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmiths promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default thus the goldsmiths of london became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit the bank of england was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in  the royal bank of scotland established the first overdraft facility in  by the beginning of the th century a bankers clearing house was established in london to allow multiple banks to clear transactions the rothschilds pioneered international finance on a large scale

accounts for his customers paying cheques drawn on himher and collecting cheques for hisher customers banco de venezuela in coro branch of nepal bank in pokhara western nepal in most common law jurisdictions there is a bills of exchange act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments including cheques and this act contains a statutory definition of the term banker banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking section  interpretation although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated the business of banking is in many english common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above in other english common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business when looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the authority may prescribe for the purposes of this act banking act singapore section  interpretation banking business means the business of either or both of the following receiving from the general public money on current deposit savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than  months  or with a

direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument this has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties even if they do not pay and collect cheques  standard businessedit large door to an old bank vault banks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers paying cheques drawn by customers in the bank and collecting cheques deposited to customers current accounts banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as automated clearing house ach wire transfers or telegraphic transfer eftpos and automated teller machines atms banks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts by accepting term deposits and by issuing debt securities such as banknotes and bonds banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts by making installment loans and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending banks provide different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals nonbanks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account banks can create new money when they make a loan new loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system the money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated in the united kingdom between  and  there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt the amount of money in the economy as measured by m in the uk went from £ billion to £ billion between  and  much of the increase caused by bank lending if all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened

business modelsedit a bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customerscitation needed the bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities this difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance in the past  years american banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions first this includes the gramm–leach–bliley act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for onestop shopping by enabling crossselling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability second they have expanded the use of riskbased pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans this helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients these products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards they make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home however with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders

weighted banks in the economyedit seb main building in tallinn estonia see also financial system economic functionsedit the economic functions of banks include issue of money in the form of banknotes and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customers order these claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par they are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments this enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other it also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend backtoback on their own account as middle men credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers the improvement comes from diversification of the banks assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations however banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position asset liability mismatchmaturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans in other words they borrow short and lend long with a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues eg accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions eg withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources eg wholesale cash markets and securities markets money creationdestruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractionalreserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed bank crisisedit otp bank in prešov slovakia banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises these include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the great depression the us

usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customers order – although money lending by itself is generally not included in the definition unlike most other regulated industries the regulator is typically also a participant in the market being either a publicly or privately governed central bank central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes however in some countries this is not the case in the uk for example the financial services authority licenses banks and some commercial banks such as the bank of scotland issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the bank of england the uk governments central bank banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account the law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows the bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank the bank agrees to pay the customers checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customers account plus any agreed overdraft limit the bank may not pay from the customers account without a mandate from the customer eg a cheque drawn by the customer the bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customers account as the customers agent and to credit the proceeds to the customers account the bank has a right to combine the customers accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship the bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customers account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank the bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customers account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the banks interests require it or the law demands it the bank must not close a customers account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days these implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank the statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms andor create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bankcustomer relationship some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules the

banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators all banks with fdicinsured deposits have the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a regulator however for soundness examinations ie whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the federal reserve is the primary federal regulator for fedmember state banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the primary federal regulator for national banks and the office of thrift supervision or ots is the primary federal regulator for thrifts state nonmember banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the fdic national banks have one primary regulator – the occ each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec was established in  as a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions although the ffiec has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing in addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the federal reserve fdic ots and occ offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut the remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator while banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks the impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less handson assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the united states the changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations it has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market a rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders the management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core while always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions safra national bank new york there are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times” the potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered in addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk banking is also an extremely competitive industry competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies credit unions cheque cashing services credit card companies

direct market instruments such as us department of treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt one of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits to compete for deposits us savings institutions offer many different types of plans passbook or ordinary deposit accounts  – permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time now and super now accounts  – function like checking accounts but earn interest a minimum balance may be required on super now accounts money market accounts  – carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance certificate accounts  – subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity notice accounts  – the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal individual retirement accounts iras and keogh plans  – a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until

accountsedit suburban bank branch bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world under gaap there are two kinds of accounts debit and credit credit accounts are revenue equity and liabilities debit accounts are assets and expenses the bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance the customer debits his or her savingsbank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit when the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds the customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement if the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement brokered depositsedit one source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations this money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors it is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits this may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank banks which failed during  and  in the united states during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits there are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts globalization in the banking industryedit in modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk the growth in crossborder activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities however despite these reductions in barriers and growth in crossborder activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries in the usa for instance very few banks even worry about the riegle–neal act which promotes more efficient interstate banking in the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation one reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals on the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporations financial information is available around the globe see alsoedit types of institutions bad bank bankers bank building society cooperative bank credit union

among many other things the code of hammurabi from  bc recorded interestbearing loans banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities this began around  bc in assyria and babylonia later in ancient greece and during the roman empire lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations they accepted deposits and changed money archaeology from this period in ancient china and india also shows evidence of money lending activity the origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early renaissance italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like florence lucca siena venice and genoa the bardi and peruzzi families dominated banking in thcentury florence establishing branches in many other parts of europe one of the most famous italian banks was the medici bank set up by giovanni di bicci de medici in  the earliest known state deposit bank banco di san giorgio bank of st george was founded in  at genoa italy modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of london who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service in exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods the sealing of the bank of england charter  gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith the goldsmith paid interest on these deposits since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmiths customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking the promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmiths promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default thus the goldsmiths of london became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit the bank of england was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in  the royal bank of scotland established the first overdraft facility in  by the beginning of the th century a bankers clearing house was established in london to allow multiple banks to clear transactions the rothschilds pioneered international finance on a large scale

definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the authority may prescribe for the purposes of this act banking act singapore section  interpretation banking business means the business of either or both of the following receiving from the general public money on current deposit savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than  months  or with a period of call or notice of less than that period paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers since the advent of eftpos electronic funds transfer at point of sale direct credit direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument this has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties even if they do not pay and collect cheques  standard

making advances to customers on current accounts by making installment loans and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending banks provide different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals nonbanks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account banks can create new money when they make a loan new loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system the money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated in the united kingdom between  and  there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt the amount of money in the economy as measured by m in the uk went from £ billion to £ billion between  and  much of the increase caused by bank lending if all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened

business modelsedit a bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customerscitation needed the bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities this difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance in the past  years american banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions first this includes the gramm–leach–bliley act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for onestop shopping by enabling crossselling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability second they have expanded the use of riskbased pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans this helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients these products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards they make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home however with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders

weighted banks in the economyedit seb main building in tallinn estonia see also financial system economic functionsedit the economic functions of banks include issue of money in the form of banknotes and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customers order these claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par they are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments this enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other it also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend backtoback on their own account as middle men credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers the improvement comes from diversification of the banks assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations however banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position asset liability mismatchmaturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans in other words they borrow short and lend long with a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues eg accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions eg withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources eg wholesale cash markets and securities markets money creationdestruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractionalreserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed bank crisisedit otp bank in prešov slovakia banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises these include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the great depression the us

usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customers order – although money lending by itself is generally not included in the definition unlike most other regulated industries the regulator is typically also a participant in the market being either a publicly or privately governed central bank central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes however in some countries this is not the case in the uk for example the financial services authority licenses banks and some commercial banks such as the bank of scotland issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the bank of england the uk governments central bank banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account the law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows the bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank the bank agrees to pay the customers checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customers account plus any agreed overdraft limit the bank may not pay from the customers account without a mandate from the customer eg a cheque drawn by the customer the bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customers account as the customers agent and to credit the proceeds to the customers account the bank has a right to combine the customers accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship the bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customers account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank the bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customers account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the banks interests require it or the law demands it the bank must not close a customers account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days these implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank the statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms andor create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bankcustomer relationship some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules the

banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators all banks with fdicinsured deposits have the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a regulator however for soundness examinations ie whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the federal reserve is the primary federal regulator for fedmember state banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the primary federal regulator for national banks and the office of thrift supervision or ots is the primary federal regulator for thrifts state nonmember banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the fdic national banks have one primary regulator – the occ each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec was established in  as a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions although the ffiec has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing in addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the federal reserve fdic ots and occ offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut the remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator while banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks the impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less handson assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the united states the changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations it has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market a rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders the management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core while always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions safra national bank new york there are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times” the potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered in addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk banking is also an extremely competitive industry competing in the financial services industry has become tougher with the entrance of such players as insurance agencies credit unions cheque cashing services credit card companies

banksedit to be able to provide home buyers and builders with the funds needed banks must compete for deposits the phenomenon of disintermediation had to dollars moving from savings accounts and into direct market instruments such as us department of treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt one of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits to compete for deposits us savings institutions offer many different types of plans passbook or ordinary deposit accounts  – permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time now and super now accounts  – function like checking accounts but earn interest a minimum balance may be required on super now accounts money market accounts  – carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance certificate accounts  – subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity notice accounts  – the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal individual retirement accounts iras and keogh plans  – a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until after withdrawal checking accounts  – offered by some institutions under definite restrictions all withdrawals and deposits are completely the sole decision and responsibility of the account owner

accountsedit suburban bank branch bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world under gaap there are two kinds of accounts debit and credit credit accounts are revenue equity and liabilities debit accounts are assets and expenses the bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance the customer debits his or her savingsbank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit when the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds the customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement if the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement brokered depositsedit one source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations this money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors it is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits this may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank banks which failed during  and  in the united states during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits there are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts globalization in the banking industryedit in modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk the growth in crossborder activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities however despite these reductions in barriers and growth in crossborder activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries in the usa for instance very few banks even worry about the riegle–neal act which promotes more efficient interstate banking in the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation one reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals on the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporations financial information is available around the globe see alsoedit types of institutions bad bank bankers bank building society cooperative bank credit union

among many other things the code of hammurabi from  bc recorded interestbearing loans banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers

important innovations they accepted deposits and changed money archaeology from this period in ancient china and india also shows evidence of money lending activity the origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early renaissance italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like florence lucca siena venice and genoa the bardi and peruzzi families dominated banking in thcentury

banco di san giorgio bank of st george was founded in  at genoa italy modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of london who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service in exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods the sealing of the bank of england charter  gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith the goldsmith paid interest on these deposits since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmiths customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking the promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmiths promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default thus the goldsmiths of london became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit the bank of england was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in  the royal bank of scotland established the first overdraft facility in  by

jurisdictions there is a bills of exchange act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments including cheques and this act contains a statutory definition of the term banker banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking section  interpretation although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated the business of banking is in many english common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above in other english common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business when looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the authority may prescribe for the purposes of this act banking act singapore section  interpretation banking business means the

direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument this has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be

and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals nonbanks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account banks can create new money when they make a loan new loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system the money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated in the united kingdom between  and  there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt the amount of money in the economy as measured by m in the uk went from £ billion to £ billion between  and  much of the increase caused by bank lending if all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened

business modelsedit a bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customerscitation needed the bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities this difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance in the past  years american banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions first this includes the gramm–leach–bliley act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for onestop shopping by enabling crossselling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability second they have expanded the use of riskbased pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans this helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients these products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards they make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home however with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders

and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customers order these claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par they are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments this enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other it also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend backtoback on their own account as middle men credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers the improvement comes from diversification of the banks assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations however banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position asset liability mismatchmaturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans in other words they borrow short and lend long with a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues eg accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions eg withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources eg wholesale cash markets and securities markets money creationdestruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractionalreserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed bank crisisedit otp bank in prešov slovakia banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises these include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the great depression the us

usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customers order – although money

is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account the law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows the bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank the bank agrees to pay the customers checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customers account plus any agreed overdraft limit the bank may not pay from the customers account without a mandate from the customer eg a cheque drawn by the customer the bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customers account as the customers agent and to credit the proceeds to the customers account the bank has a right to combine the customers accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship the bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customers account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank the bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customers account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the banks interests require it or the law demands it the bank must not close a customers account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days these implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank the statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms andor create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bankcustomer relationship some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules the

banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators all banks with fdicinsured deposits have the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a regulator however for soundness examinations ie whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the federal reserve is the primary federal regulator for fedmember state banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the primary federal regulator for national banks and the office of thrift supervision or ots is the primary federal regulator for thrifts state nonmember banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the fdic national banks have one primary regulator – the occ each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec was established in  as a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions although the ffiec has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing in addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the federal reserve fdic ots and occ offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut the remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator while banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks the impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less handson assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the united states the changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations it has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market a rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders the management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core while always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions safra national bank new york there are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times” the potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered in addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk banking is also an extremely

direct market instruments such as us department of treasury obligations agency securities and corporate debt one of the greatest factors in recent years in the movement of deposits was the tremendous growth of money market funds whose higher interest rates attracted consumer deposits to compete for deposits us savings institutions offer many different types of plans passbook or ordinary deposit accounts  – permit any amount to be added to or withdrawn from the account at any time now and super now accounts  – function like checking accounts but earn interest a minimum balance may be required on super now accounts money market accounts  – carry a monthly limit of preauthorized transfers to other accounts or persons and may require a minimum or average balance certificate accounts  – subject to loss of some or all interest on withdrawals before maturity notice accounts  – the equivalent of certificate accounts with an indefinite term savers agree to notify the institution a specified time before withdrawal individual retirement accounts iras and keogh plans  – a form of retirement savings in which the funds deposited and interest earned are exempt from income tax until

credit credit accounts are revenue equity and liabilities debit accounts are assets and expenses the bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance the customer debits his or her savingsbank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit when the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds the customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement if the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement brokered depositsedit one source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations this money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors it is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits this may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank banks which failed during  and  in the united states during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits there are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts globalization in the banking industryedit in modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk the growth in crossborder activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities however despite these reductions in barriers and growth in crossborder activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries in the usa for instance very few banks even worry about the riegle–neal act which promotes more efficient interstate banking in the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation one reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals on the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what

among many other things the code of hammurabi from  bc recorded interestbearing loans banking began with the first prototype banks of merchants of the ancient world which made grain loans to farmers and traders who carried goods between cities this began around  bc in assyria and babylonia later in ancient greece and during the roman empire lenders based in temples made loans and added two important innovations they accepted deposits and changed money archaeology from this period in ancient china and india also shows evidence of money lending activity the origins of modern banking can be traced to medieval and early renaissance italy to the rich cities in the centre and north like florence lucca siena venice and genoa the bardi and peruzzi families dominated banking in thcentury florence establishing branches in many other parts of europe one of the most famous italian banks was the medici bank set up by giovanni di bicci de medici in  the earliest known state deposit bank banco di san giorgio bank of st george was founded in  at genoa italy modern banking practices including fractional reserve banking and the issue of banknotes emerged in the th and th centuries merchants started to store their gold with the goldsmiths of london who possessed private vaults and charged a fee for that service in exchange for each deposit of precious metal the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee these receipts could not be assigned only the original depositor could collect the stored goods the sealing of the bank of england charter  gradually the goldsmiths began to lend the money out on behalf of the depositor which led to the development of modern banking practices promissory notes which evolved into banknotes were issued for money deposited as a loan to the goldsmith the goldsmith paid interest on these deposits since the promissory notes were payable on demand and the advances loans to the goldsmiths customers were repayable over a longer time period this was an early form of fractional reserve banking the promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmiths promise to pay allowing goldsmiths to advance loans with little risk of default thus the goldsmiths of london became the forerunners of banking by creating new money based on credit the bank of england was the first to begin the permanent issue of banknotes in  the royal bank of scotland established the first overdraft facility in  by the beginning of the th century a bankers clearing house was established in london to allow multiple banks to clear transactions the rothschilds pioneered international finance on a large scale

accounts for his customers paying cheques drawn on himher and collecting cheques for hisher customers banco de venezuela in coro branch of nepal bank in pokhara western nepal in most common law jurisdictions there is a bills of exchange act that codifies the law in relation to negotiable instruments including cheques and this act contains a statutory definition of the term banker banker includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not who carry on the business of banking section  interpretation although this definition seems circular it is actually functional because it ensures that the legal basis for bank transactions such as cheques does not depend on how the bank is structured or regulated the business of banking is in many english common law countries not defined by statute but by common law the definition above in other english common law jurisdictions there are statutory definitions of the business of banking or banking business when looking at these definitions it is important to keep in mind that they are defining the business of banking for the purposes of the legislation and not necessarily in general in particular most of the definitions are from legislation that has the purpose of regulating and supervising banks rather than regulating the actual business of banking however in many cases the statutory definition closely mirrors the common law one examples of statutory definitions banking business means the business of receiving money on current or deposit account paying and collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers the making of advances to customers and includes such other business as the authority may prescribe for the purposes of this act banking act singapore section  interpretation banking business means the business of either or both of the following receiving from the general public money on current deposit savings or other similar account repayable on demand or within less than  months  or with a period of call or notice of less than that period paying or collecting cheques drawn by or paid in by customers since the advent of eftpos electronic funds transfer at point of sale direct credit direct debit and internet banking the cheque has lost its primacy in most banking systems as a payment instrument this has led legal theorists to suggest that the cheque based definition should be broadened to include financial institutions that conduct current accounts for customers and enable customers to pay and be paid by third parties even if they do not pay and collect cheques  standard businessedit large door to an old bank vault banks act as payment agents by conducting checking or current accounts for customers paying cheques drawn by customers in the bank and collecting cheques deposited to customers current accounts banks also enable customer payments via other payment methods such as automated clearing house ach wire transfers or telegraphic transfer eftpos and automated teller machines atms banks borrow money by accepting funds deposited on current accounts by accepting term deposits and by issuing debt securities such as banknotes and bonds banks lend money by making advances to customers on current accounts by making installment loans and by investing in marketable debt securities and other forms of money lending banks provide different payment services and a bank account is considered indispensable by most businesses and individuals nonbanks that provide payment services such as remittance companies are normally not considered as an adequate substitute for a bank account banks can create new money when they make a loan new loans throughout the banking system generate new deposits elsewhere in the system the money supply is usually increased by the act of lending and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated in the united kingdom between  and  there was an increase in the money supply largely caused by much more bank lending which served to push up property prices and increase private debt the amount of money in the economy as measured by m in the uk went from £ billion to £ billion between  and  much of the increase caused by bank lending if all the banks increase their lending together then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default the banks then become more cautious so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened

business modelsedit a bank can generate revenue in a variety of different ways including interest transaction fees and financial advice traditionally the most significant method is via charging interest on the capital it lends out to customerscitation needed the bank profits from the difference between the level of interest it pays for deposits and other sources of funds and the level of interest it charges in its lending activities this difference is referred to as the spread between highly the cost of funds and the loan interest rate historically profitability from lending activities has been cyclical and dependent on the needs and strengths of loan customers and the stage of the economic cycle fees and financial advice constitute a more stable revenue stream and banks have therefore placed more emphasis on these revenue lines to smooth their financial performance in the past  years american banks have taken many measures to ensure that they remain profitable while responding to increasingly changing market conditions first this includes the gramm–leach–bliley act which allows banks again to merge with investment and insurance houses merging banking investment and insurance functions allows traditional banks to respond to increasing consumer demands for onestop shopping by enabling crossselling of products which the banks hope will also increase profitability second they have expanded the use of riskbased pricing from business lending to consumer lending which means charging higher interest rates to those customers that are considered to be a higher credit risk and thus increased chance of default on loans this helps to offset the losses from bad loans lowers the price of loans to those who have better credit histories and offers credit products to high risk customers who would otherwise be denied credit third they have sought to increase the methods of payment processing available to the general public and business clients these products include debit cards prepaid cards smart cards and credit cards they make it easier for consumers to conveniently make transactions and smooth their consumption over time in some countries with underdeveloped financial systems it is still common to deal strictly in cash including carrying suitcases filled with cash to purchase a home however with the convenience of easy credit there is also increased risk that consumers will mismanage their financial resources and accumulate excessive debt banks make money from card products through interest charges and fees charged to cardholders

and current accounts subject to cheque or payment at the customers order these claims on banks can act as money because they are negotiable or repayable on demand and hence valued at par they are effectively transferable by mere delivery in the case of banknotes or by drawing a cheque that the payee may bank or cash netting and settlement of payments – banks act as both collection and paying agents for customers participating in interbank clearing and settlement systems to collect present be presented with and pay payment instruments this enables banks to economize on reserves held for settlement of payments since inward and outward payments offset each other it also enables the offsetting of payment flows between geographical areas reducing the cost of settlement between them credit intermediation – banks borrow and lend backtoback on their own account as middle men credit quality improvement – banks lend money to ordinary commercial and personal borrowers ordinary credit quality but are high quality borrowers the improvement comes from diversification of the banks assets and capital which provides a buffer to absorb losses without defaulting on its obligations however banknotes and deposits are generally unsecured if the bank gets into difficulty and pledges assets as security to raise the funding it needs to continue to operate this puts the note holders and depositors in an economically subordinated position asset liability mismatchmaturity transformation – banks borrow more on demand debt and short term debt but provide more long term loans in other words they borrow short and lend long with a stronger credit quality than most other borrowers banks can do this by aggregating issues eg accepting deposits and issuing banknotes and redemptions eg withdrawals and redemption of banknotes maintaining reserves of cash investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources eg wholesale cash markets and securities markets money creationdestruction – whenever a bank gives out a loan in a fractionalreserve banking system a new sum of money is created and conversely whenever the principal on that loan is repaid money is destroyed bank crisisedit otp bank in prešov slovakia banks are susceptible to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises these include liquidity risk where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds credit risk the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it and interest rate risk the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable if rising interest rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans banking crises have developed many times throughout history when one or more risks have emerged for a banking sector as a whole prominent examples include the bank run that occurred during the great depression the us

usually the definition of the business of banking for the purposes of regulation is extended to include acceptance of deposits even if they are not repayable to the customers order – although money lending by itself is generally not included in the definition unlike most other regulated industries the regulator is typically also a participant in the market being either a publicly or privately governed central bank central banks also typically have a monopoly on the business of issuing banknotes however in some countries this is not the case in the uk for example the financial services authority licenses banks and some commercial banks such as the bank of scotland issue their own banknotes in addition to those issued by the bank of england the uk governments central bank banking law is based on a contractual analysis of the relationship between the bank defined above and the customer – defined as any entity for which the bank agrees to conduct an account the law implies rights and obligations into this relationship as follows the bank account balance is the financial position between the bank and the customer when the account is in credit the bank owes the balance to the customer when the account is overdrawn the customer owes the balance to the bank the bank agrees to pay the customers checks up to the amount standing to the credit of the customers account plus any agreed overdraft limit the bank may not pay from the customers account without a mandate from the customer eg a cheque drawn by the customer the bank agrees to promptly collect the cheques deposited to the customers account as the customers agent and to credit the proceeds to the customers account the bank has a right to combine the customers accounts since each account is just an aspect of the same credit relationship the bank has a lien on cheques deposited to the customers account to the extent that the customer is indebted to the bank the bank must not disclose details of transactions through the customers account – unless the customer consents there is a public duty to disclose the banks interests require it or the law demands it the bank must not close a customers account without reasonable notice since cheques are outstanding in the ordinary course of business for several days these implied contractual terms may be modified by express agreement between the customer and the bank the statutes and regulations in force within a particular jurisdiction may also modify the above terms andor create new rights obligations or limitations relevant to the bankcustomer relationship some types of financial institution such as building societies and credit unions may be partly or wholly exempt from bank license requirements and therefore regulated under separate rules the

banking industry is one of the most heavily regulated and guarded in the world with multiple specialized and focused regulators all banks with fdicinsured deposits have the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as a regulator however for soundness examinations ie whether a bank is operating in a sound manner the federal reserve is the primary federal regulator for fedmember state banks the office of the comptroller of the currency occ is the primary federal regulator for national banks and the office of thrift supervision or ots is the primary federal regulator for thrifts state nonmember banks are examined by the state agencies as well as the fdic national banks have one primary regulator – the occ each regulatory agency has their own set of rules and regulations to which banks and thrifts must adhere the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec was established in  as a formal interagency body empowered to prescribe uniform principles standards and report forms for the federal examination of financial institutions although the ffiec has resulted in a greater degree of regulatory consistency between the agencies the rules and regulations are constantly changing in addition to changing regulations changes in the industry have led to consolidations within the federal reserve fdic ots and occ offices have been closed supervisory regions have been merged staff levels have been reduced and budgets have been cut the remaining regulators face an increased burden with increased workload and more banks per regulator while banks struggle to keep up with the changes in the regulatory environment regulators struggle to manage their workload and effectively regulate their banks the impact of these changes is that banks are receiving less handson assessment by the regulators less time spent with each institution and the potential for more problems slipping through the cracks potentially resulting in an overall increase in bank failures across the united states the changing economic environment has a significant impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans rate competition for deposits and the general market changes industry trends and economic fluctuations it has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market a rising interest rate environment may seem to help financial institutions but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders the management of the banks’ asset portfolios also remains a challenge in today’s economic environment loans are a bank’s primary asset category and when loan quality becomes suspect the foundation of a bank is shaken to the core while always an issue for banks declining asset quality has become a big problem for financial institutions safra national bank new york there are several reasons for this one of which is the lax attitude some banks have adopted because of the years of “good times” the potential for this is exacerbated by the reduction in the regulatory oversight of banks and in some cases depth of management problems are more likely to go undetected resulting in a significant impact on the bank when they are discovered in addition banks like any business struggle to cut costs and have consequently eliminated certain expenses such as adequate employee training programs banks also face a host of other challenges such as ageing ownership groups across the country many banks’ management teams and board of directors are ageing banks also face ongoing pressure by shareholders both public and private to achieve earnings and growth projections regulators place added pressure on banks to manage the various categories of risk banking is also an extremely

accountsedit suburban bank branch bank statements are accounting records produced by banks under the various accounting standards of the world under gaap there are two kinds of accounts debit and credit credit accounts are revenue equity and liabilities debit accounts are assets and expenses the bank credits a credit account to increase its balance and debits a credit account to decrease its balance the customer debits his or her savingsbank asset account in his ledger when making a deposit and the account is normally in debit while the customer credits a credit card liability account in his ledger every time he spends money and the account is normally in credit when the customer reads his bank statement the statement will show a credit to the account for deposits and debits for withdrawals of funds the customer with a positive balance will see this balance reflected as a credit balance on the bank statement if the customer is overdrawn he will have a negative balance reflected as a debit balance on the bank statement brokered depositsedit one source of deposits for banks is brokers who deposit large sums of money on behalf of investors through trust corporations this money will generally go to the banks which offer the most favourable terms often better than those offered local depositors it is possible for a bank to engage in business with no local deposits at all all funds being brokered deposits accepting a significant quantity of such deposits or hot money as it is sometimes called puts a bank in a difficult and sometimes risky position as the funds must be lent or invested in a way that yields a return sufficient to pay the high interest being paid on the brokered deposits this may result in risky decisions and even in eventual failure of the bank banks which failed during  and  in the united states during the global financial crisis had on average four times more brokered deposits as a percent of their deposits than the average bank such deposits combined with risky real estate investments factored into the savings and loan crisis of the s regulation of brokered deposits is opposed by banks on the grounds that the practice can be a source of external funding to growing communities with insufficient local deposits there are different types of accounts saving recurring and current accounts globalization in the banking industryedit in modern time there has been huge reductions to the barriers of global competition in the banking industry increases in telecommunications and other financial technologies such as bloomberg have allowed banks to extend their reach all over the world since they no longer have to be near customers to manage both their finances and their risk the growth in crossborder activities has also increased the demand for banks that can provide various services across borders to different nationalities however despite these reductions in barriers and growth in crossborder activities the banking industry is nowhere near as globalized as some other industries in the usa for instance very few banks even worry about the riegle–neal act which promotes more efficient interstate banking in the vast majority of nations around the globe the market share for foreign owned banks is currently less than a tenth of all market shares for banks in a particular nation one reason the banking industry has not been fully globalized is that it is more convenient to have local banks provide loans to small business and individuals on the other hand for large corporations it is not as important in what nation the bank is in since the corporations financial information is available around the globe see alsoedit types of institutions bad bank bankers bank building society cooperative bank credit union

came to power in  at the end of a period of social unrest however once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power laissezfaire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism in  italy was hit hard by the great depression trying to handle the crisis the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale a number of mixed entities were formed whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as corporatism at the same time the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure after the invasion of ethiopia italy intervened to support francos nationalists in the spanish civil war by  italy had the highest percentage of stateowned enterprises after the soviet union italys involvement in world war ii as a member of the axis powers required the establishment of a war economy the allied invasion of italy in  eventually caused the

new fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world and received under the marshall plan us million from  the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until

been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive

italo balbo visit alfa romeo italy emerged from world war i in a poor and weakened condition the national fascist party of benito mussolini came to power in  at the end of a period of social unrest however once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power laissezfaire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism in  italy was hit hard by the great depression trying to handle the crisis the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale a number of mixed entities were formed whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as corporatism at the same time the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure after the invasion of ethiopia italy intervened to support francos nationalists in the spanish civil war by  italy had the highest percentage of stateowned enterprises after the soviet union italys involvement in world war ii as a member of the axis powers required the establishment of a war economy the allied invasion of italy in  eventually caused the italian political structure – and the

economic miracle after the end of world war ii italy was in rubble and occupied by foreign armies a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced european economies however the new geopolitical logic of the cold war made possible that the former enemy italy a hingecountry between western europe and the mediterranean and now a new fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world and received under the marshall plan us million from  the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until the hot autumns massive strikes and social unrest of – which then combined with the later  oil crisis and put an abrupt end to the prolonged boom it has been calculated that the italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of gdp of  per year between – and  per year between – italian rates of growth were second only but very close to the german rates in europe and among the oeec countries only japan had been doing better

unemployment rose sharply especially among the young and by  there were one million unemployed people under age  inflation continued aggravated by the increases in the price of oil in  and  the budget deficit became permanent and intractable averaging about  percent of the gross domestic product gdp higher than any other industrial country the lira fell steadily from  lira to the us dollar in  to  lira in  the economic recession went on into the mids until a set of reforms led to the independence of the bank of italy and a big reduction of the indexation of wages that strongly reduced inflation rates from  in  to  in  the new macroeconomic and political stability resulted in a second exportled economic miracle based on small and mediumsized enterprises producing clothing leather products

stock exchange increased its market capitalization more than fivefold in the space of a few years gdp per capita big four western europe however the italian economy of the s presented a problem it was booming thanks to increased productivity and surging exports but unsustainable fiscal deficits drove the growth in the s the new maastricht criteria boosted the urge to curb the public debt already at

classified under the convergence objective gdp per capita less than  of the eu average since the unification of italy in  a wide and increasing economic divide has been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive organized crime and very high unemployment rates in

came to power in  at the end of a period of social unrest however once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power laissezfaire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism in  italy was hit hard by the great depression trying to handle the crisis the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale a number of mixed entities were formed whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as corporatism at the same time the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure after the invasion of ethiopia italy intervened to support francos nationalists in the spanish civil war by  italy had the highest percentage of stateowned

for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until

been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive

economic miracle after the end of world war ii italy was in rubble and occupied by foreign armies a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced european economies however the new geopolitical logic of the cold war made possible that the former enemy italy a hingecountry between western europe and the mediterranean and now a new fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world and received under the marshall plan us million from  the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until the hot autumns massive strikes and social unrest of – which then combined with the later  oil crisis and put an abrupt end to the prolonged boom it has been calculated that the italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of gdp of  per year between – and  per year between – italian rates of growth were second only but very close to the german rates in europe and among the oeec countries only japan had been doing better from growth to stagnationedit prime minister giulio andreotti far left with g leaders in bonn  the s were a period of economic political turmoil and social unrest in italy known as years of lead unemployment rose sharply especially among the young and by  there were one million unemployed people under age  inflation continued aggravated by the increases in the price of oil in  and  the budget deficit became permanent and intractable averaging about  percent of the gross domestic product gdp higher than any other industrial country the lira fell steadily from  lira to the us dollar in  to  lira in  the economic recession went on into the mids until a set of reforms led to the independence of the bank of italy and a big reduction of the indexation of wages that strongly reduced inflation rates from  in  to  in  the new macroeconomic and political stability resulted in a second exportled economic miracle based on small and mediumsized enterprises producing clothing leather products

stock exchange increased its market capitalization more than fivefold in the space of a few years gdp per capita big four western europe however the italian economy of the s presented a problem it was booming thanks to increased productivity and surging exports but unsustainable fiscal deficits drove the growth in the s the new maastricht criteria boosted the urge to curb the public debt already at

classified under the convergence objective gdp per capita less than  of the eu average since the unification of italy in  a wide and increasing economic divide has been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive organized crime and very high unemployment rates in

came to power in  at the end of a period of social unrest however once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power laissezfaire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism in  italy was hit hard by the great depression trying to handle the crisis the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale a number of mixed entities were formed whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as corporatism at the same time the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure after the invasion of ethiopia italy intervened to support francos nationalists in the spanish civil war by  italy had the highest percentage of stateowned enterprises after the soviet union italys involvement in world war ii as a member of the axis powers required the establishment of a war economy the allied invasion of italy in  eventually caused the

new fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world and received under the marshall plan us million from  the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until

fund – southern italy is almost all classified under the convergence objective gdp per capita less than  of the eu average since the unification of italy in  a wide and increasing economic divide has been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive

italo balbo visit alfa romeo italy emerged from world war i in a poor and weakened condition the national fascist party of benito mussolini came to power in  at the end of a period of social unrest however once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power laissezfaire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism in  italy was hit hard by the great depression trying to handle the crisis the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale a number of mixed entities were formed whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as corporatism at the same time the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure after the invasion of ethiopia italy intervened to support francos nationalists in the spanish civil war by  italy had the highest percentage of stateowned enterprises after the soviet union italys involvement in world war ii as a member of the axis powers required the establishment of a war economy the allied invasion of italy in  eventually caused the italian political structure – and the economy – to rapidly collapse the allies on the one hand and the germans on the other took over the administration of the areas of italy under their control by the end of the war italian per capita income was at its lowest point since the beginning of the th century postwar economic miracleedit main article italian economic miracle the fiat  launched in  is considered a symbol of italys postwar economic miracle after the end of world war ii italy was in rubble and occupied by foreign armies a condition that worsened the chronic development gap towards the more advanced european economies however the new geopolitical logic of the cold war made possible that the former enemy italy a hingecountry between western europe and the mediterranean and now a new fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world and received under the marshall plan us million from  the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until the hot autumns massive strikes and social unrest of – which then combined with the later  oil crisis and put an abrupt end to the prolonged boom it has been calculated that the italian economy experienced an average rate of growth of gdp of  per year between – and  per year between – italian rates of growth were second only but very close to the german rates in europe and among the oeec countries only japan had been doing better from growth to stagnationedit prime minister giulio andreotti far left with g leaders in bonn  the s were a period of economic political turmoil and social unrest in italy known as years of lead unemployment rose sharply especially among the young and by  there were one million unemployed people under age  inflation continued aggravated by the increases in the price of oil in  and  the budget deficit became permanent and intractable averaging about  percent of the gross domestic product gdp higher than any other industrial country the lira fell steadily from  lira to the us dollar in  to  lira in  the economic recession went on into the mids until a set of reforms led to the independence of the bank of italy and a big reduction of the indexation of wages that strongly reduced inflation rates from  in  to  in  the new macroeconomic and political stability resulted in a second exportled economic miracle based on small and mediumsized enterprises producing clothing leather products

stock exchange increased its market capitalization more than fivefold in the space of a few years gdp per capita big four western europe however the italian economy of the s presented a problem it was booming thanks to increased productivity and surging exports but unsustainable fiscal deficits drove the growth in the s the new maastricht criteria boosted the urge to curb the public debt already at

classified under the convergence objective gdp per capita less than  of the eu average since the unification of italy in  a wide and increasing economic divide has been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive organized crime and very high unemployment rates in  it was estimated that about  of the businesses in the sicilian cities of catania and palermo paid protection money thanks to grassroots movement like addiopizzo the mafia racket is slowly but

came to power in  at the end of a period of social unrest however once mussolini acquired a firmer hold of power laissezfaire and free trade were progressively abandoned in favour of government intervention and protectionism in  italy was hit hard by the great depression trying to handle the crisis the fascist government nationalized the holdings of large banks which had accrued significant industrial securities establishing the istituto per la ricostruzione industriale a number of mixed entities were formed whose purpose it was to bring together representatives of the government and of the major businesses these representatives discussed economic policy and manipulated prices and wages so as to satisfy both the wishes of the government and the wishes of business this economic model based on a partnership between government and business was soon extended to the political sphere in what came to be known as corporatism at the same time the aggressive foreign policy of mussolini led to an increasing military expenditure after the invasion of ethiopia italy intervened to support francos nationalists in the spanish civil war by  italy had the highest percentage of stateowned enterprises after the soviet union italys involvement in world war ii as a member of the axis powers required the establishment of a war economy the allied invasion of italy in  eventually caused the

new fragile democracy threatened by the nato occupation forces the proximity of the iron curtain and the presence of a strong communist party was considered by the usa as an important ally for the free world and received under the marshall plan us million from  the end of aid through the plan could have stopped the recovery but it coincided with a crucial point in the korean war whose demand for metal and manufactured products was a further stimulus of italian industrial production in addition the creation in  of the european common market with italy as a founding member provided more investment and eased exports these favorable developments combined with the presence of a large labour force laid the foundation for spectacular economic growth that lasted almost uninterrupted until the hot autumns massive strikes and social unrest of – which then combined with the later  oil crisis and put an abrupt end to the prolonged boom it has been calculated that the italian economy

been noticeably growing between the northern provinces and the southern half of the italian state in the early decades of the new kingdom the lack of an effective land reform heavy taxes and other economic measures imposed on the south together with the removal of protectionist tariffs on agricultural goods made the situation virtually impossible for many tenant farmers and land owners multitudes chose to emigrate rather than try to eke out a meager living especially from  to  in addition the surge of brigandage and the mafia provoked widespread violence corruption and illegality after the rise of benito mussolini the iron prefect cesare mori tried to defeat the already powerful criminal organizations flourishing in the south with some degree of success fascist policy aimed at the creation of an italian empire and southern italian ports were strategic for all commerce towards the colonies with the invasion of southern italy the allies restored the authority of the mafia families lost during the fascist period and used their influence to maintain public order in the s the cassa per il mezzogiorno was set up as a huge public master plan to help industrialize the south aiming to do this in two ways through land reforms creating  new smallholdings and through the growth pole strategy whereby  of all government investment would go to the south thus boosting the southern economy by attracting new capital stimulating local firms and providing employment however the objectives were largely missed and as a result the south became increasingly subsidized and state dependent incapable of generating private growth itself even at present huge regional disparities persist problems in southern italy still include widespread political corruption pervasive

whatsapp email economic integration between real and financial markets and the flow of information regarding them have grown spectacularly over the past decade the “globalization” of the world’s

financial development at a deeper level of economic analysis however many aspects of these topics are not yet understood the purpose of this conference is to identify whether something fundamental has
