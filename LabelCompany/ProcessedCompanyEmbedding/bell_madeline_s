musical genre come together wonderfully on blessed her fourth album for the dutch label challenge bell grew up with gospel and soul sang with a uk rock group worked in popularized versions of classics by beethoven verdi and handel in the netherlands and sang and recorded jazz kicking matters off with the look of love a tune made popular by top popsoul singer dionne warwick she moves easily to other forms of vocal stylings theres a poignant classicallike rendition of george gershwins home rhythm and blues is represented by before i open my mouth replete with squawking sax of allard buwalda dancing vibes of frits landesbergen and honky tonk piano of long time playing partner cor bakker motown influences especially of diana ross are obvious on the last laugh which comes complete with background singers the latin comes in with to dance the samba as far as gospel goes her exposure in her adolescent years to this music is apparent on almost every track even beach boys medley wouldnt seem out of place in a sunday morning church service as befitting a vocalist with broad experience and success bell has an extraordinarily versatile singing style which she is able to apply without any stain to the type of song being performed while her voice isnt necessarily that strong it is clear and pristine in its earthiness her phrasing is impeccable and she articulates the lyrics with the right level of emotion and always with clarity fortunately the electronic gimmicks synthesizers etc on the album are handled with discretion and dont overwhelm her vocals or otherwise generally clutter up the session as they are wont to do strongly backed by top european jazz musicians bells album is recommended  dave nathan rovi all genres avantgarde blues childrens classical country easy

new jersey usa and raised by her grandmother who was originally instrumental in encouraging madelines natural singing talent at the age of five she sang gospel music in church and at school approximately eight years later madeline became aware of pop music inspired by sam cook during her high school years madeline met singers at school who targeted their gospel music towards pop music in addition madeline sang on corners of streets local clubs and talent shows madeline was a prominent member of the local gospel choir and at the age of fourteen her voice was unique and powerfully penetrating with such range it could be distinctly heard above a one hundred and fifty strong gospel ensemble madeline was sixteen when she joined her first gospel group the glovertones and sang in church halls all over new jersey and new york this superb group toured americas deep south with madelines illuminating voice impressing audiences everywhere madeline stayed with the glovertones for two years until her involvement with the alex bradford singers alex bradford who formed and pioneered americas most famous gospel group was immediately magnetised by madelines compelling and creative
