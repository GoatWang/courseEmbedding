glossary specialized resourcesyouth seniors caring for loved ones military native americans public service campaign morgan stanley to pay  million for misleading investors in subprime rmbs offerings for immediate release  washington dc — the securities and exchange commission today charged three morgan stanley entities with misleading investors in a pair of residential mortgagebacked securities rmbs securitizations that the firms underwrote sponsored and issued morgan stanley agreed to settle the charges by paying  million to be returned to harmed investors in an assetbacked securities offering federal regulations under the securities laws require the disclosure of delinquency information for the mortgage loans serving as collateral  an sec investigation found that morgan stanley misrepresented the current or historical delinquency status of mortgage loans underlying two subprime rmbs securitizations that came against a backdrop of rising borrower delinquencies and unprecedented distress in the subprime market “the delinquency status of mortgage loans in an rmbs securitization is vital information to investors because those loans are the primary source of funds by which they potentially can recover and profit from their investments” said michael osnato chief of the sec enforcement division’s complex financial instruments unit  “morgan stanley understated the number of delinquent loans behind these securitizations during a critical juncture of the financial crisis and denied investors the full extent of the facts necessary to make informed investment decisions” according to the sec’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against morgan stanley  co llc morgan stanley abs capital i inc and morgan stanley mortgage capital holdings llc these securitizations were collateralized by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal value balance of more than  billion  they were the last subprime rmbs that morgan stanley sponsored issued and underwrote  the offerings themselves were called morgan stanley abs capital i inc trust nc and morgan capital i inc trust he the sec’s order finds that offering documents for the securitizations stated that less than  percent of each pool’s aggregate principal balance was more than  days but less than  days delinquent as of each securitization’s cutoff date  with the exception of these loans morgan stanley represented as of each securitization’s closing date that no payment under any mortgage loan was more than  days delinquent at any time since origination  on the contrary approximately  percent of the loans in the he securitization had been delinquent at some point since origination and in the nc securitization approximately  percent of the loans were currently delinquent rather than the disclosed  percent according to the sec’s order for the he securitization morgan stanley had a chart showing that approximately  percent of the loans had been delinquent at some point since origination and morgan stanley also used information about payments made after the cutoff date to determine the loans disclosed as delinquent as of the cutoff date  by using the later payment data morgan stanley misreported  fewer loans as currently delinquent leading the firm to disclose that less than  percent of the loans were delinquent  the nc securitization did not close until the month after the cutoff date so morgan stanley received updated payment information at that time this information showed that approximately  percent of the loans had become delinquent  yet despite the delayed closing and a representation that extended the delinquency representation to the closing morgan stanley did not disclose or remove the additional delinquent loans and instead continued with the  percent figure the sec charged morgan stanley with violations of sections a and  of the securities act of   without admitting or denying the allegations the firm agreed to the entry of an order that requires a payment of  in disgorgement  in prejudgment interest and a  penalty  the order notes that a fair fund is being created for the disgorgement interest and penalties paid in this case for the purpose of returning money to investors who were harmed in these securitizations the sec’s investigation was conducted by andrew sporkin jeffrey weiss creola kelly melissa lessenberry and delmer raibourn in the complex financial instruments unit with assistance from kyle deyoung of the trial unit and eugene canjels in the division of economic and risk analysis  the sec appreciates the
