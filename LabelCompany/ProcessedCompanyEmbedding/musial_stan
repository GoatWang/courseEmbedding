places the st louis cardinal star within the context of the timesthe great depression and wartime and postwar americaand the issues then prevalent in professional baseball particularly race and the changing economics of the game giglio illuminates how the times shaped musial and delves further into his popular image as a warm unfailingly gracious role model known for good sportsmanship and devotion to family authorseditors james n giglio is distinguished professor of history at missouri state university in springfield he is the author of several books including the presidency of john f kennedy the missouri biography series edited by william e foley reviews “musial was and still is the most beloved cardinal here’s the full story of how one of the best sluggers and nicest guys in baseball history won both ballgames and the hearts of st louis fans”—usa today baseball weekly “musial should stand as the definitive biography of the great st louis cardinal first basemanoutfielder    written by a leading historian of thcentury america this volume offers a fine examination of its subject and his era    the research for this book is impeccable”—choice “stan musial has had millions of words written about him but nothing compares to this indepth study of the person and his accomplishments giglio spent several years researching the available printed and manuscript sources and interviewed and corresponded with countless ballplayers family members and friends representing musial’s entire history he has dealt with both myth and reality and shed light on aspects of musial’s life ignored or overlooked by previous biographers”—missouri historical review “giglio’s book allows us to see musial as a more interesting person than the one who comes out of the much simpler and familiar legend more complex than a onedimensional figure that in turn makes musial’s accomplishments both on the field and off all the more remarkable”—cardinals magazine “this biography is an excellent example of solid and thorough research smooth and lively writing and critical analysis giglio has produced an intelligent baseball biography that offers much to historians of twentiethcentury america”—journal of american history awards musial from stash to stan the man by james n giglio is a finalist for the third annual dave moore award sponsored by elysian fields

goldsteinjan   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story stan musial one of baseball’s greatest hitters and a revered figure in the storied history of the st louis cardinals —  the player they called stan the man — died saturday he was the cardinals said he died at his home in ladue mo surrounded by familya signature musial image endures he waits for a pitch in a lefthanded crouch his knees bent and close together his body leaning to the left as he peers over his right shoulder the red no  on his back the stance was likened to a corkscrew or as the white sox pitcher and dodgers coach ted lyons once described it “a kid peeking around the corner to see if the cops are coming”swinging from that stance musial won seven batting championships hit  home runs and amassed  hits his brilliance lay in his consistency he had  hits at home and  on the road he drove in  runs and scored  runs and his power could be explosive he set a major league record equaled only once when he hit five home runs in a doubleheader“there is only one way to pitch to musial — under the plate” leo durocher the manager of the brooklyn dodgers and new york giants teams that musial often victimized once said advertisement continue reading the main story musial was renowned for his concentration at the plate and for his patience he struck out only  times in  atbats in his  major league seasons all as a cardinal a gentlemanly and sunny figure — he loved to play “take me out to the ball game” on his harmonica — he was never ejected from a game when admirers approached him he chatted them up with his familiar “whattayasay whattayasay” continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but he otherwise had little of the glamour of the other stars of his era — from the world war ii years to the early s — when baseball was the undisputed king of sports he did not have the mystique of joe dimaggio the tempestuousness of ted williams the electrifying presence of willie mays the countryboy aura of mickey mantle his cardinals were far removed from the coastal media centers and he shunned controversyhe simply tattooed national league pitchingmusial played on three world series championship teams won three most valuable player awards had a career batting average of  while playing in the outfield and at first base and was the fourth player inducted into the baseball hall of fame in his first year of eligibilityhe was the most cherished cardinal of them all in a city that witnessed the exploits of grover cleveland alexander and rogers hornsby dizzy dean and the gashouse gang enos slaughter marty marion red schoendienst ozzie smith lou brock bob gibson mark mcgwire and albert pujolspujols the slugger from the dominican republic was sometimes saluted as el hombre as he neared the end of his time in st louis“i don’t want to be called that” he told the st louis postdispatch in  “there is one man that gets that respect and that’s stan musial i know el hombre is the man in spanish but he is the man”a frail musial wearing a cardinal red sport jacket went to the white house in february  to receive the medal of freedom the nation’s highest civilian award from president obama who called him “untarnished a beloved pillar of the community a gentleman you’d want your kids to emulate”there is one gateway arch in st louis but two statues of stan the man both are outside the cardinals’ busch stadium the earlier one engraved with the words of ford frick the baseball commissioner at the time speaking at a ceremony before musial’s final game on sunday sept   at home against the cincinnati reds “here stands baseball’s perfect warrior here stands baseball’s perfect knight” photo stan musial won seven national league batting titles was a threetime mvp and helped the st louis cardinals capture three world series championships credit patrick burnsthe new york times stanley frank musial was born on nov   in donora pa a zinc and steel mill town some  miles from pittsburgh where smokestacks sent grime aloft around the clock he was the fifth of six children of lukasz musial a polish immigrant who worked at a steel and wire company and his wife mary a new york city native of czech descent advertisement continue reading the main story his father had no interest in the frivolity of baseball but the young musial competed in gymnastics at a polish sports club developing his athleticism and he played baseball with balls that his mother sewed from rags and string his family and friends called him stashu the diminutive for the polish stanislaushis high school didn’t have a baseball team but he excelled in american legion play as a lefthanded pitcher and he could hit as well the cardinals signed him to a minorleague contract for the  seasonmusial was pitching for the cardinals’ farm team at daytona beach in the florida state league in  when he injured his left shoulder diving for a ball while playing the outfield part time he was converted to a fulltime outfielder and his batting prowess brought him to the cardinals in september playing left field in a superb outfield with terry moore in center and slaughter in right musial hit  in  when the cardinals staged a furious pennant run to overtake the dodgers then defeated the yankees in the world seriesmusial hit  in  winning his first batting title but the cardinals lost to the yankees in a repeat world series matchup he batted  in  when the cardinals were again pennantwinners and defeated the st louis browns in what was known as the streetcar seriesmusial spent  in the navy which assigned him to play baseball for its ball clubs to entertain servicemen when he returned to the cardinals he picked up where he had left off winning his second battling title with a  average in  and helping to propel the cardinals to the pennant which they won in a playoff with the dodgers they also won the world series title defeating

about refusing to take the field in protest when the team was scheduled to play at brooklyn in may but the truth of those accounts remains murky and the cardinals did in fact play against robinson advertisement continue reading the main story musial did not speak out on racial issues but he showed no reluctance to face black players he liked to tell of how he once played baseball with blacks in his hometown among them buddy griffey the father and grandfather of the outfield stars ken griffey and ken jrthe dodgers’ don newcombe major league baseball’s first black pitching star recalled hearing taunts from some cardinals players but never from musial or schoendienst musial’s longtime roommate“we’d watch ’em in the dugout” newcombe told george vecsey in “stan musial an american life” “wisecracks call names i could see from the mound when i got there in ’ you never saw guys like musial or schoendienst they never showed you up the man went about his job and did it damn well and never had the need to sit in the dugout and call a black guy a bunch of names because he was trying to change the game and make it what it should have been in the first place a game for all people”the cardinals did not have a black player until despite musial’s consistent brilliance the cardinals fell in the standings during the late s and ’s when the dodgers of robinson newcombe and roy campanella and the giants of mays and monte irvin dominated the national league photo stan musial a hall of famer was so beloved in st louis that two statues of him stand outside the cardinals’ ballpark credit dilip vishwanatgetty images musial thrived at the dodgers’ ebbets field plastering the rightfield scoreboard and hitting home runs over it and winning the grudging admiration of the notoriously tough brooklyn fans“i did some phenomenal hitting there” he told the pittsburgh postgazette “the ballpark was small so the seats were close to the field and you could hear just about anything anybody said then i’d come to the plate and the fans would say ‘here comes that man again’ and a sportswriter picked it up and it became stan the man”the nickname attributed to bob broeg of the st louis postdispatch stayed with musial as he piled up hits combining his talent with intense concentration at the plate“i’m always set for a fastball” musial told the saturday evening post in  when he got his th career hit “when i’m concentrating up there i know that pitcher’s best fastball when he lets the ball go if that ball jumps out in front of me there about   feet i know it’s got to be a fastball if he lets that ball go and it doesn’t come up that quick then it’s going to be a change or a curve i never watch the spin of the ball i watch the ball in its entirety and what it’s doing and how fast it’s reacting to me and then i try to adjust from there” advertisement continue reading the main story musial was durable as well he once held the national league record for consecutive games played a streak that ended at  when he hurt a shoulder in august  he won his seventh and last batting title that season hitting  the following year he became the first national league player with a  contractmusial retired after the  season having played in  allstar games he was elected to the hall of fame in after his playing days ended musial became an adviser to the cardinals as a senior vice president the team ended an year pennant drought in  and beat the yankees in the world series having finally fielded outstanding black players like gibson brock curt flood and bill whitemusial succeeded bob howsam as the cardinals’ general manager in  but the team was set to contend when he took the job and he made no major personnel moves that team managed by schoendienst went on to defeat the boston red sox in the world seriesmusial stepped down from the post after the season to pursue his business interests notably the st louis restaurant popularly known as stan and biggie’s he had been greeting guests there as an owner since  when he bought into a steakhouse run by julius garagnani known as biggie a product of the italianamerican hill section of st louismusial is survived by his son richard his daughters gerry ashley janet schwarze and jeanne edmonds  grandchildren and  greatgrandchildren his wife lillian whom he married in  died in may  at st louis did not forget musial at the  allstar game there he received a huge ovation as he rode onto the field in a golf cart and handed president obama a baseball for his ceremonial first pitch and musial did not forget the cardinals he visited with them during the  playoffs and world series when they defeated the texas rangers in seven gamesmusial was appreciated even by rival players “stan was such a nice guy that i was probably happy for him when he homered off me” johnny antonelli a leading lefthanded pitcher of the s told danny peary in the oral history “we played the game”musial had an explanation for his good nature “maybe one reason i’m so cheerful is that for more than  years i’ve had an unbeatable combination going for me — getting paid often a lot to do the thing i love the most” he told sports illustrated in  “the love is important but let’s not pretend so is the money my old cardinals coach mike gonzales used to say to me ‘musial if i could hit like you i’d play for nothing’ not me but i wouldn’t play for the money without the fun” correction january   an earlier version of this obituary misstated the number of hits stan musial had at home and on the road it was  for each not  correction january   an obituary in some editions last sunday about the baseball great stan musial misspelled the surname of a new york giants player in the late s and ’s when the giants and dodgers

delmore called ball four even as anderson and taylor contended that musial had foul tipped the ball because the ball was still in play and delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher musial kept running in attempt to make second base seeing that musial was trying for second alvin dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball the ball wound up in the hands of field announcer pat pieper but dark ended up getting it back anyway absentmindedly however delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to taylor anderson finally noticed that musial was trying for second took the new ball and threw it to second baseman tony taylor andersons throw flew over taylors head into the outfield dark at the same time that anderson threw the new ball threw the original ball to

league career leader in extrabase hits  and total bases  he also held nl career marks in categories such as hits  games played  doubles  and rbi  he finished his career with  home runs despite never having led the nl in the category jerry lansche speculates musial would likely have become the second player after babe ruth with  rbi and would have exceeded  career home runs had he not served in the military his lowest full season rbi output before the war was  in  and as he needed only  rbi to reach  for his full career he certainly would have exceeded  rbi by playing without injury in  his home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached  he did not hit more than  home runs in any season before he entered the navy and did not hit as many as  the number he would have needed to become a  career homer club member until   years after returning to baseball from world war ii his career hit total was evenly split between  hits at home and  hits on the road steven r bullock speculates that it is possible that without military service musial might have continued playing to attempt to exceed ty cobbs career hit record of  even if musial had hit safely  times the average of his hits in the  years before and the  years after his service in the navy in  he still would have been  hits short of tying ty his hit total in his last season at age  was only  even if he could have had  hits a season the average of his last  seasons he would have had to play to age  to attain the hits record he was the first major league player to appear in more than  games at two different positions registering  games in the outfield and  at first base since musials retirement in  tony gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average hank aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of  total bases in musials  major league appearances he was never ejected from a game speaking about his quiet reputation within the sports history sportscaster bob costas said he didnt hit a homer in his last atbat he hit a single he didnt hit in  straight games he married his high school sweetheart and stayed married to her  all musial represents is more than two decades of sustained excellence and complete decency as a human being postplaying career and family lifeedit musial was named a vice

among those records he ranked as the major league career leader in extrabase hits  and total bases  he also held nl career marks in categories such as hits  games played  doubles  and rbi  he finished his career with  home runs despite never having led the nl in the category jerry lansche speculates musial would likely have become the second player after babe ruth with  rbi and would have exceeded  career home runs had he not served in the military his lowest full season rbi output before the war was  in  and as he needed only  rbi to reach  for his full career he certainly would have exceeded  rbi by playing without injury in  his home run production is a different story and it is highly unlikely he would have reached  he did not hit more than  home runs in any season before he entered the

record of  even if musial had hit safely  times the average of his hits in the  years before and the  years after his service in the navy in  he still would have been  hits short of tying ty his hit total in his last season at age  was only  even if he could have had  hits a season the average of his last  seasons he would have had to play to age  to attain the hits record he was the first major league player to appear in more than  games at two different positions registering  games in the outfield and  at first base since musials retirement in  tony gwynn has been the only player to finish his career with a higher lifetime batting average hank aaron has been the only player to surpass his record of  total bases in musials  major league appearances he was never ejected from a game

a  and in the summer it got down to  and then probably in september got down to  stan musial summer getting older start i consciously memorized the speed at which every pitcher in the league threw his fastball curve and slider then id pick up the speed of the ball in the first  feet of its flight and knew how it would move once it has crossed the plate stan musial feet speed flight i could always hit i learned to hit with a broomstick and a ball of tape and i could always get that bat on the ball stan musial always bat learned when a pitchers throwing a spitball dont worry and dont complain just hit the dry side like i do stan musial worry complain dry back in my day we didnt think about money as much we enjoyed playing the game we loved baseball i didnt think about anybody else but the cardinals stan musial money baseball day i have no hesitation to say that st louis is a great place in which to live and work stan musial work great live it seemed like i always did some great hitting in brooklyn the field there was close to the stands every time i started walking to the plate i could hear the fans say here comes that man again here comes that man stan musial time great man im a musician i play harmonica for relaxation a good way to relax and entertain people an excellent way to have fun stan musial good relax fun a lot of hitters stay away from the plate some are close up some are forward some are back the thing about hitting is this you have to know the strike zone thats the most important thing hit strikes and put the bat on the ball stan musial know important you when we played the dodgers in st louis they had to come through our dugout and our bat rack was right there where they had to walk my bats kept disappearing and i couldnt figure it out turns out pee wee reese was stealing my bats i found that out later after we got out of baseball he and rube walker stole my bats stan musial baseball walk stealing used to be bats had thick handles and a big barrel then they found its not the size of the bat that gets home runs  its the speed with which you can swing it stan musial home speed you i came up in  and i played against men who played in the s
