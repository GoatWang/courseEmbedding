 years in the organization and have seen that priorities get changed overnight almost everyone conveyed about adhoc work lack of planning stuff but the management is interested in bringing clients only and want resources to manage the releases somehow this makes the team demotivated and less productive every time one ormore task will be at highest priority and other planned tasks will be at risk i have seen pms apologizing unnecessarily to the clients just because management cannot plan well prioritize tasks do not set unrealistic expectations with clientswhen some release will happen exactly as per the plan and as per schedule it would be a miracle in the history of altruistathese people even do not conduct appraisals on time this year it was delayed by around  months never the

managementcurrent employee  anonymous employeecurrent employee  anonymous employeerecommendspositive outlookapproves of ceoi have been working at designs for health fulltime more than a yearprosthe culture of designs for health is by far the best i have ever experienced and i have been fortunate enough to work with some incredible companiesindividuals the company is family owned by the lizottes’s and they are all inspiring humble fun caring and encouraging everyone is supportive informative and terrific motivators if looking for training support motivation encouragement or just a good old reality check it’s just a phone call away the wisdom and expertise of my peers and leaders is shared openly and consistently my favorite thing about working with designs for health is how they help you realize the best version of yourself in every wayi am extremely passionate about the product we produce and love that this company is designed to help everyone from employees to clients win this is an exciting and rewarding adventure i can’t thank all who make this happen enough i have been given opportunities i wouldn’t have had at other companies i respect our founding team and admire their values and perhaps most importantly i love the people i work with so much so that i have referred several people that have since been hired and are celebrating their one year anniversariesheres how you know youve made it at designs for health the reward for doing a good job is getting a bigger tougher problem next time meaning you are always solving the easiest problem you will ever solve again this takes a lot of resilience and active managing of selfexpectations to remember that things are not actually getting worse the problems are just getting harder so my advice is to remember that and then take a second to realize that it would be a lot less fun if the reverse were true and isnt that precisely why you wanted this job in the first place anyway it sure was for meconsthere are always going to be growing pains in any company so i will say we have them i value the ownership that i have in my role i love knowing that my ideas on ways that can improve the day to day operations are valued heard and have even been implemented we have an exceptional team and their passion and commitment to excellence has made my experience refreshingwhat i will also say is that if you as an employee just share your issues with your peers and not with your leads supervisor and managers it will never get past the break roomit is not always easy  but that is what makes every day challenging and rewarding at the same timeadvice to managementkeep up the exceptional effort working from an individual employees strengths we serve customers best when we all are working on something we are exceptional at and have the drive and passion to see it through take time in your team’s work of learning and curiositythis breeds the innovation you seekcontinue to find and promote

people know this before ever going to training its not an easy job and yes it has a very high turnover rate on the same hand some people do very well with it and make very good money doing itso i have been with the company for quite some time and know who some of these reviews are being left from and i do agree with some of what has been said but on the same hand some of these people were just not good workers and want to blame management for it i will agree with the people that say some people are over worked and because of that turnover has been a little high but that is also due to the growth the company has encountered and not being able to get quality people hired quick enough also i do agree that the company is quite cliquey and certain people get away with things because they are friends with upper management dfh is not perfect but it also far from being as bad as some have tried to describeadvice to managementlisten to the employees that have been around and loyal for
