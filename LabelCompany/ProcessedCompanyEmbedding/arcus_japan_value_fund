macrae peter tasker and mark pearson discuss their latest product with eurekahedge   looking forward how do you envisage absolute return investment strategies or styles evolving over time we cant really say much about the way in which the industry will evolve but we dont expect to make major changes within arcus the real driver is always bottomup stock analysis which is marks key contribution is it cheap and why peters macro view provides context in a year or so we may want to sell this stock what will the market be talking about then should we be looking for companies that will be the stars of the coming recovery or those that will survive the coming crunch roberts tools provide the glue that lets us handle large portfolios and answer the perennial favourite why did we lose money it is a recipe that seems to work ajvf is just about applying our established approach to the stocks we love best you have two successful japanese hedge funds what made you decide to launch a long only fund arcus has always managed long only funds alongside its hedge funds and like the hedge funds these have been very successful all of the funds have outperformed topix substantially however until now the long funds have been available only to japanese investors the arcus japan value fund ajvf will be the first arcus long fund open to international investors we reckon that outstanding value is available in japanese smallmicro caps and stocks with limited liquidity by way of illustration one of our more conservative long funds recently had the following profile an average per of x an average pbr of x and average growth of  thats an attractive valuetogrowth ratio by any standard we hold lots of positions like this in our hedge funds but in many cases we cant expand them because they are constrained by risk control and liquidity now that the hedge funds are closed we see ajvf as the ideal vehicle to make these exposures available in concentrated form can you explain your investment process for this fund the fund will seek out a range of different kinds of undervalued stocks  classic deep discount value stocks net nets and extremely low pes and some quasidistressed companies but we will also hold garp stocks undervalued new economy stocks and some undervalued major companies if they look compelling enough our industry knowledge quantitative tools and screening are used to highlight candidates that are then selected on the basis of fundamental analysis this is the process that we have used for the last decade and in all our funds with a strong emphasis on fundamental research and  companies to cover in japan why do you prefer to be based in london rather than tokyo london is a great base for regulatory reasons and for convenience but its a little misleading to see us as based solely over here peter our strategist is based full time in tokyo and mark the fund manager spent three months there last year most of his time was spent visiting companies and we visit well over one hundred companies a year in japan as well as the several hundred we meet in london it is certainly important to be firmly grounded in tokyo it tends to be the big wellknown foreignerfriendly  in other words expensive  companies that visit london on balance our longs come from visits in japan and our shorts from london however there is also a big advantage to distance  it gives you perspective our style is highly contrarian and its important to us to avoid being caught up in the latest fad or fear is your strategy flexible would you consider large cap stocks if you uncover some sudden turnaround in living dead companies until recently investors hated zombies so much that few of them are large caps any more peter and robert wrote an article on this for swisshedge a few months back laying out our perspective on the impact of the bear market on equity valuations there is a price at which zombies are a buy and there is enormous upside for the ones that survive resona is a classic example of course since the resona rescue such stocks have performed strongly and it is no longer obvious that one is being paid for the risk but the time may well return… that is why we have made the mandate flexible right now we dont know what will be cheapest in a year or two but that is where ajvf will be your capacity is quite low at m is this purely determined by liquidity and if so how would you go about increasing capacity with increased investor demand capacity is constrained by the ajvfs objective of maximising performance many of the best investment opportunities are in stocks with rather low liquidity ajvf has been structured to allow it to invest in such stocks with a tight gate for redemptions but there is always a limit to the size of investment that can be made without hitting price our objective is to provide a significant exposure to the best investment opportunities in japan and as with our hedge funds we are not going to let size get in the way of this it is possible that the fund will close below m depending on market conditions but i dont think any increase in this limit is at all likely if we are right about the attractiveness of these assets they will be marked up significantly  in some cases by a factor of two or three  over the next few years of course they will then become more liquid but i do not think it would make much sense to increase the fund size after the best returns had been made what are the advantages of running a long only strategy as compared to a longshort strategy ajvf grew out of a kind of frustration with longshort we have set up the hedge funds with tight risk and liquidity parameters these are constraints that restrict our ability to increase some of the very best positions there are great stocks out there that we would love to leverage into but cant because it would blow zensens volatility budget of  a year or just be unmanageable if we face a substantial redemption some month that is where ajvf comes in it is going to be a highvolatility fund we want investors who want to take risk and who have a longterm vision on this asset class that is why we have tight redemption terms we can take more exposure because investors are less focussed on the short term what is your fee structure we charge  fixed and  performance  a hedge fund structure investors will have the choice of an absolute performance fee or one relative to topix generally longonly absolute return funds tend to charge lower fees than hedge funds how do you justify your fees arcus has a strong track record of managing long only funds   typical fund size years absolute fund return topix return relative perf annual relative perf psjef m      avf m      leaders m      neo m      returns are for funds and managed accounts for which arcus is investment advisor and are quoted net of all fees from inception to september  or to fund closure past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns psjef is probably the most comparable to ajvf in terms of mandate but our relative returns on all these long funds are comparable to the absolute returns normally seen on hedge funds so we dont see any reason to be shy on fees we are not a commodity manager we cant take  billion and continue to deliver this kind of performance so we prefer to keep the funds small and make money when we do a good job for our clients what would be the difference in investor appetite for this fund as opposed to your longshort strategy we see ajvf and zensen as fulfilling quite different roles in clients portfolios ajvf will appeal to investors who want unhedged long exposure to what we think is the most exciting part of japan inc and who want it for the long term zensen is a cashrelative product taking significantly less risk due to the success of your longshort strategy do you expect to raise assets from investors who have allocated to the arcus zensen fund and the arcus japan long  short fund we have strong indications of interest from investors in our hedge funds and also significant commitments from new investors though it is still early days  launch is  december  we think the fund will open with well over  million in fact the strong appetite for this kind of exposure is one of the reasons we like this class of stocks they havent really moved yet but with the levels of interest we are seeing it is possible that they will move rather soon we want to be invested when they do do you feel that japan markets have finally recovered topix is currently up  from its march low which leaves it down  below its peak in early  is it half way or just the beginning in every past cycle the problem for japan is that the market recovery has allowed the authorities to backpedal the ongoing reform it could be the same story again on the other hand  as peter noted in a strategy comment to our investors earlier this year  this time it is different this time the usual flurry of spring market support was muted the bounce dates not from administrative manoeuvres but from resonas bankruptcy and there is a good case that this is healthier at least the market now sees a way out the banks may have capital adequacy problems but the government is now following a pragmatic damageminimising strategy and monetary policy is very supportive this gives reasonable prospects of exiting deflation at the moment earnings momentum is strong industrial production is strong world markets are strong export demand is strong and policy is supportive we cant say how long this will persist but while it does there is certainly room for a further rise in the market what are your targeted returns and how do you plan to minimise your volatility what risk procedures are in place to do this we are always a little uncomfortable talking about target returns because whatever we say we know the reality will be different on average we have had doubledigit outperformance on our long funds so i guess that gives an indication of scale maybe it is better to talk about risk we actually use the same process for all our funds we have developed a proprietary system that gives robust forecasts of the marginal contribution that each stock in the universe  both our positions and all possible candidates  makes to fund risk in other words it forecasts how many cents we add to our risk budget if we put one more dollar into the stock this lets us set the funds risk exposure where we want it in zensen we use this to set a budget of  the risk system is actively telling us to limit positions to stay within this range in ajvf we use the same system so that we can see where our risk is but it does not really constrain positions in the same way both volatility and tracking to topix are going to be on the general scale of  perhaps it is repeating an earlier point but this fund is only for people who really want this exposure zensen aims to control risk ajvf aims to take it contact details arcus

course do not select their long picks solely on value criteria quality also counts and japan is so underanalysed that cheapness need not indicate low quality or slow growth a nose for takeover targets has helped the arcus fund which has received bids for  holdings over the last two years japan’s fourth mobile operator eaccess was one softbank also started running the slide rule over the firm’s neglected g license and mounted a takeover at a  premium another case of corporate activity involved a group of lowcost housing companies the six socalled power builders are joining forces in a new holding company that will soon be one of japan’s biggest builders the fund owned three of the six purchases of subsidiaries can swiftly produce accounting profits since many stocks trade below book value but cheap valuations are not the only spur for mergers corporate culture is also changing and the old japanese stereotype of profit margins being slaughtered on the altar of sales growth no longer applies cash flows that were once workhorses for debt service are now being returned to shareholders through buybacks dividends takeovers and management buyouts this virtuous cycle could soon be accelerated by a better macroeconomic outlook thanks to abenomics new prime minister abe is unique in recent history in seeing his popularity go up after his election increasing his chances of longevity in japan’s fickle politics and improving his leverage in the policy battles ahead if the drop of the yen is maintained this could do a lot to reflate the economy and help to reverse deflation taking real interest rates negative for the first time since the bubble over a few years that in turn should transform investor psychology as cash stashed in government bonds would no longer protect purchasing power arcus’ strategist peter tasker thinks abenomics represents the first really constructive economic policy in years stimulating economic activity will be good for a very wide range of japanese companies exporters such as sony or panasonic are the most obvious winners from a lower yen expanding their profit margins but all kinds of economic sensitives and operationally geared companies could be great investments whether their focus is domestic or exportdriven arcus are much more cautious on sectors with defensive bondlike characteristics for example firms in food pharmaceuticals and consumer nondiscretionary sectors command premium valuations due to their predictable earnings amongst these “expensive defensive” stocks private railways are perhaps the most overpriced and are a rich source of shorts despite all of the encouraging domestic news japan has not yet started to outperform world markets in dollar terms headline nikkei performance is of course quoted in local currency terms macrae contends that “either the fx market or the equity market is wrong” as the fx move has been far too large to have such limited impact on relative earnings prospects he also notes that value has historically done best at critical turning points when old beliefs are challenged and market leadership passes to previously disliked companies the arcus longshort fund has advanced by  in  years over a period when the local market lost  of its value this monster bear market leaves few hedge funds in japan and a dearth of sellside coverage because

women in hedge funds  commentary canada if you are not afraid of holding japanese government bonds and cash then abenomics isn’t workingpeter tasker arcus investment having a market surge  within a few months is bound to attract attention and arcus has been enjoying japan’s sudden return to the limelight after so many years of obscurity “you cannot underestimate just how anomalous japan’s twodecade bear market is” says ceo robert macrae abenomicsthe catalyst for all the excitement is abenomics the new policy environment initiated by prime minister abe “i’ve been waiting for this for  years” says japan veteran and strategist peter tasker perhaps the only manga japanese comic magazine discussion of japan’s policy options his “i am a digital cat” anticipated several ingredients of abenomics notably that japan’s hard money policy had to come to an end arcus is not forecasting specific levels for the yen exchange rate or even calling it down but at  yen per dollar the impact on the real economy is enough to end the vicious feedback loop whereby a strong currency reinforces deflationary pressures exacerbates economic weakness and encourages ever more excessive saving at current currency levels tasker is “confident abenomics will support the corporate profit cycle for at least two years and that profits will rise to new highs” he adds “if you are not afraid of holding japanese government bonds jgbs and cash then abenomics isn’t working” hinting that a “great rotation” from bonds to equities could be on the cards one reason that abenomics marks such a sea change for japanese equities according to arcus is that companies had been making much more progress over the last decade than was generally recognised by investors “in contrast to the s corporate fundamentals have been improving for the last decade” says tokyo representative mark pearson japanese companies have generated strong earnings growth between  and   annualised for topix while tse second section has done twice as well he says many people focus on the negative aspects of japan high debt demographics and deflation but we invest in companies which have been growing profits in the past decade even as gdp contracted and the population aged” notes pearson tasker adds “the surprise is not so much that the market reached  but that this took so long after the recovery in corporate profits twentytwo years after the topix peak the index was flirting with new lows and indeed trading below its year moving average” no other market in the world has offered such dismal returns for such an extended period and as investors have lost interest the level of investor attention has become apathetically low so that real improvements were overlooked for a long time with expectations so subdued and abenomics as a trigger – the consequent bounce was naturally sharp inefficiencyjapan is one of the most neglected and inefficient markets in the world with a fraction of the analyst coverage of even that of emerging markets that’s fine by us as we go directly to the companies to learn about their businesses says pearson market inefficiency creates opportunities for stockpickers like arcus particularly when their market experience dates back to the s “mark has visited more than half the  companies in japan there may be noone else in the world who has done that” says macrae arcus just do japan all funds are managed from london but the research team of pearson and analysts nick brooks and takaaki haruki are based in tokyo where they typically make two company visits a day conducted in japanese arcus initiates almost one new position after every two meetings getting this high hit rate by concentrating the visits on companies where – so long as numbers stand up and there are no surprises – the value decision is very clear “we are a value manager focusing mainly on the earnings stream that companies can generate probably what distinguishes us most is the extent to which we focus solely on value and the aggression with which we implement” says macrae ranking on simple value ratios is a first step to identify potentially cheaper companies but exauditor brooks cautions that a proper valuation requires substantial adjustments as japanese accounting certainly has its peculiarities after years of deflation book values may need adjusting and offbalancesheet pension liabilities can be another quirk of japanese accounting however compared with us accounting in particular earnings tend to be a much more realistic measure of the increase in shareholder value the longevity and cohesion of the arcus team is clear “with the honourable addition of nick we are the same team that set up in ” says macrae arcus’s investment principles have also remained remarkably consistent over time with a strong value emphasis ensuring that the team are always searching in areas that most investors ignore or actively dislike and usually taking a two to threeyear perspective “what is cheap changes over time” notes brooks for most of the postcrisis period the value numbercrunching increasingly indicated that shorting expensive defensives and owning cheap cyclicals was the best trade probably due to the fashion for “low volatility” stocks now following the rally more of the higherquality companies are offering better value and the market appears more balanced however as value is a much overused and abused term the team see their track record warts and all as giving investors a more practical idea what they can expect with a performance history this long you can see the conditions in which they do well and badly notes macrae noone enjoys losing money and it is always tempting to hope that lessons have been learned and that it isn’t going to happen again – but this seems unwise “our trade is always sensibly contrarian” says pearson and betting against the market always carries the risk that you are wrong historyarcus was born in  its three founders were robert macrae a quant value specialist mark pearson a stock picker and peter tasker an awardwinning sellside strategist at kleinwort benson from their differing perspectives all agreed that japan offered fertile ground for value investing they raised domestic assets via local broker universal securities who gathered the best part of a billion dollars of assets in the early years unfortunately the bearmarket mentality already deeply ingrained in the local investor psyche made the japanese rigorous sellers of winners and so turnover was high as investors took profits dayone investors in the arcus japan long short fund ajlsf a ucits have now almost quadrupled their money since april  from  arcus sought out stickier investors overseas making the strategy available as cayman fund zensen both funds are serial winners of the hedge fund journal’s europe  and ucits hedge performance awards arcus also run longonly funds that have generated substantial absolute returns as well as beating benchmarks by an impressive margin the mid and large capfocused arcus japan fund a luxembourg ucits has made  since  in contrast to the horizontal journey made by the topix index “we have been able to pick undervalued successful companies that have allowed our funds to perform even if the market did not” is pearson’s explanation overall arcus’s midlargecap longonly strategy stitching this together with the earlier leaders fund has delivered annual outperformance of  since september  the highly specialist small and microcap vehicle arcus japan value fund ajvf has outpaced the topix by almost  a year since december  half the positions in this fund are below  million market cap demanding a mandatory  monthly gate and restricting its appeal mostly to families and highnetworths the new genseki fund is a more conventional smallcap fund aiming at a wider audience by offering day liquidity while arcus aims to outperform over periods of a few years it is perfectly frank about some spells of underperformance the climax of the tmt bubble in  was naturally tough time for any value investor and ajlsf lost  this was recovered as the bubble burst and fundamentals reasserted themselves allowing for strong performance during the  bear market and for a great   however was another weak period at least in relative terms when japan experienced a smallcap bubble as many foreign funds tried to invest unmanageable amounts into smaller stocks  was also very difficult with investor fears rising to unprecedented levels at the time “prices were discounting such a severe depression that multiyear losses would destroy most of book value and a meaningful fraction of listed companies would go bankrupt” notes pearson and arcus was as usual too early to argue that the world was not going to end as arcus wrote in a  investor circular two days before the lehman insolvency “to be quite clear on what these numbers mean to us ajvf on pe x pb x and ajf on x and x are simply the cheapest and most attractive that we have ever seen” though it gave investors a rough ride this aggressive approach did very well as fears started to recede over the following months opportunitiesfastforward from the crisis through the neglected but profitable years of  and we come back to abenomics how is the new environment going to drive returns earnings may be the fundamental driver for stocks but somehow the cash generated has to be returned to shareholders “the prevailing wisdom has long seen japanese companies as chronically unprofitable and scandalously antishareholder” notes pearson “but we expect continued substantial earnings growth accompanied by increasing dividends and share buybacks” with so much of arcuss long portfolio trading on singledigit pe multiples and also looking good on other metrics such as cashflow yields and dividend yields there is clearly scope for multiple expansion while arcus very seldom invests in pure asset plays preferring to see evidence that assets are being used profitably many companies in the arcus portfolios have net cash as opposed to net debt this speaks to another potential booster for share prices after years of deleveraging even a marginal move towards releveraging corporate balance sheets could translate into a transformational increase in returns on equity and there are plenty more opportunities available over  companies still trade below net cash and half of the market trades below book value more than any other developed market corporate activitycorporate activity is another way to unlock this value and since  no fewer than  arcus holdings have been taken over bought out or subject to other valueenhancing corporate activity “we have felt for some time that japan is a market ripe for activism again and that our value style would benefit” opines pearson the first  wave of activists may have beat their retreat but their legacy is that it has become unacceptable for predators to squeeze out minorities without offering a decent price and premia are typically substantial softbank’s recent takeover of eaccess stands out for the  premium paid but even so is widely seen as a good buy for softbank the economic rationale for domestic activism is clear and the trend is clearly rising both in numbers and in the sizes of the companies involved many of arcuss cheap holdings are natural targets third point’s interest in sony suggests a second wave of foreign interest is beginning sony was a topfive pick for arcus back in february and an example of how even stocks that are reasonably well analysed can be very undervalued by japanese standards sony is well researched with  sellside analysts following the stock but only one of these had a buy rating on the company when arcus bought it at half of book value now that new york manager dan loeb has written a well publicised letter to the company its potential is becoming widely understood the lossmaking televisions division has masked the strong profitability of other units such as music films and insurance loeb’s letter suggests a modest and achievable restructuring that will prove hard to ignore and could unlock substantial value loeb has added to his stake after the market pullback reflationif abenomics can reignite economic growth and persuade thrifty consumers to stuff less of their earnings into their vast piggybanks brooks points out that this will be gamechanging for many stocks looking at the real estate for example renting property currently costs nearly three times as much as buying even with a fixedrate mortgage but people are not rushing to buy because based on the experience of over  years they expect further falls in house prices if property prices merely stop falling for a period then buying instead of renting becomes a rational decision even if property prices doubled buying would still be cheaper than renting rising real estate prices should have a powerful wealth effect encouraging construction and consumption arcuss preferred stock in the sector nisshin fudosan is an apartment builder that even after shooting up  since arcus bought trades well below book value – and holds substantial net cash this has allowed it to ride out the  years of deflation and benefit from being one of the few survivors and still provides substantial security if the investment thesis – as has often been the case in japan – takes longer than expected to play out by contrast the consensus trade appears to be to buy the iconic real estate stocks and arcus are short several as the sharp rises has moved them far beyond book value even considering any likely gains “is it ever smart to pay more than one dollar for real estate that is worth one dollar” asks macrae suspicion of thematic investing shorting companies priced for perfection and buying neglected value are all arcus trademarks the same philosophy applies in the retail sector uniqlo the owner fast retailing doubled in a matter of months helped by being the largest constituent of the sharepriceweighted nikkei index and encouraging arcus to short it at the same time other retailers started looking like the cinderellas of the rally languishing on fears that a weaker yen would increase the cost of their imported inputs however there are signs of a sea change in consumer sentiment and nascent pricing power for producers apple has recently imposed a  price rise on its products and as other importers follow suit attitudes will change typically arcus has profited from a revival in discretionary spending in less trodden areas buying for example unique niche retailer komehyo that recycles gifts given to geisha girls and hostesses arcus also sees value in japan’s answer to ikea nitori this bottomup approach to identifying earnings power creates a highly individual portfolio looking to the futuresimilar examples exist in most sectors with stocks in great niches but totally unknown to most investors and with so many interesting opportunities it might be natural to get carried away with arcus however this does not seem likely as they have always taken a slow and cautious approach particularly on capacity after the good performance of  hardclosed in  with  million staying shut until  because macrae argues studies suggest fund size rather than age is the key factor degrading returns in older funds as the arcus team are associated with more than onequarter of their funds – the result of reinvesting performance fees – their overriding aim is to keep returns high and so grow their capital alongside that of external investors however with assets around  million there is still a reasonable amount of capacity to fill before arcus’s smallcap and hedge funds get close to their target of billion and attaining that is likely to take some quarters yet macrae wryly notes that institutional due diligence now comes by the kilo not the page however there is no rush two decades of deflation have taught the best japanese companies patience and made them lean and efficient the arcus team have learned the same lessons profile ajabinu quote  arcus japan fund  absolute international  bloomberg markets error could not add
