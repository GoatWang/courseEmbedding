portfolio securities that are “fair valued” using procedures adopted by the fund’s board of directors instead of prices determined by the market using a fair value pricing methodology to value securities may result in a value that is different from a security’s most recent sale price and from the prices used by other investment companies to calculate their nav determination of fair value is
