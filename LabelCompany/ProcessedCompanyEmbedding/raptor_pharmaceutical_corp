net product revenue was  million for the second quarter ended june   a  increase compared to  million for the same period in   net loss on a gaap basis was  million or  per share for the second quarter of  compared to a gaap net loss of  million or  per share for the same period in  nongaap net loss which excludes noncash expenditures such as stock compensation amortization and impairment of iprd and change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions was  million or  per share for the second quarter of  compared to a nongaap net loss of  million or  per share for the same period in  cash and cash equivalents were  million as of june   raptor is raising its  global net revenue guidance to  to  million from  to  million and affirming its guidance for nongaap operating expenses excluding noncash expenditures such as stock compensation amortization and impairment of iprd and change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions of between  and  million “i’m delighted that we delivered another record quarter for sales driven primarily by growing patient demand for procysbi ” said julie anne smith president and ceo of raptor “for the first time procysbi revenue was augmented by sales of quinsair which is off to a terrific launch in europe based on our outstanding commercial performance we are pleased to raise our  revenue guidance we look forward to continued growth from both products and supporting patients living with rare diseases and with limited options” second quarter  business highlights in april raptor commenced the first commercial sales of quinsair levofloxacin inhalation solution in germany and denmark for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis to date approval for reimbursement for quinsair has been achieved in numerous european countries in june raptor participated in the th european cystic fibrosis conference and presented new analyses of data from its phase  clinical study mpex comparing quinsair to inhaled tobramycin solution in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infections the data suggest that subjects with three or more pulmonary exacerbations in the prior year who were randomized to receive quinsair had a significantly lower incidence of pulmonary exacerbations when compared with their peers who were randomized to receive the active comparator tobramycin inhalation solution p second quarter  financial results raptor provides nongaap financial measures which it believes can enhance an overall understanding of its financial performance when considered together with gaap figures refer to the section of this press release below entitled “nongaap financial information and other disclosures” for further discussion on this subject net product revenue global net revenue for the second quarter of  was  million compared to  million for the second quarter of  the  revenue growth was driven by further market penetration in the us and in europe and an increase in named patient sales in other international territories for procysbi and by the introduction of quinsair during the quarter cost of sales cost of sales was  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million for the second quarter of  the increase was due to higher quarterly sales yearoveryear leading to higher direct costs and royalty expenses in  research  development rd rd expenses for the second quarter of  were  million compared to  million for the second quarter of  the increased expense for the three month period ended june   was primarily due to increased activities associated with our product portfolio support for the european quinsair launch and related to preparation for a potential nda filing for quinsair in a cystic fibrosis indication in the us  selling general and administrative sga sga expenses were  million for the second quarter of  compared to  million for the second quarter of  the increase in sga expenses was primarily a result of increased personnel costs and promotional support for the worldwide commercial operations of procysbi and quinsair in europe interest expense interest expense for the second quarter of  was  million compared to  million for the second quarter of  the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in principal from which raptor’s interest expense is calculated net loss gaap net loss in the second quarter of  was  million or  per share compared to a net loss of  million or  per share for the second quarter of  nongaap net loss which excludes noncash expenditures such as stock compensation amortization and impairment of iprd and change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions for the second quarter of  was  million or  per share compared to a nongaap net loss of  million or  per share in the second quarter of  cash and cash equivalents as of june   raptor had  million in cash and cash equivalents compared to  million in cash and cash equivalents at march    fullyear financial guidance raising  global net revenue guidance to  to  million from   to  millionrefining procysbi  revenue growth to at least  over  revenuesreiterating nongaap operating expense guidance which excludes noncash expenditures such as stock compensation amortization and impairment of iprd and change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions of  to  million raptor is unable to reconcile nongaap operating expense guidance to gaap operating expense guidance without unreasonable efforts and believes any such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing to investors raptor is unable to predict the probable significance of any of the abovelisted adjustments product and pipeline updates procysbi for nephropathic cystinosis in the second quarter raptor recorded the first procysbi sales in several additional european countriesa new drug submission nds for procysbi for the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis is currently under review by health canada recently raptor received notice from health canada that it is seeking additional information to complete its review raptor intends to submit a response to health canada in a timely fashion to preserve priority review status and expects that health canadas timeline for review of the nds will recommence when it accepts raptor’s response as a result raptor anticipates a delay in health canada’s decision on the potential marketing approval of procysbi quinsair for cystic fibrosis in april raptor launched quinsair in germany and denmark for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in adults with cystic fibrosis and to date quinsair has become available for reimbursement in several territories in the eu and raptor is actively expanding into new countriesraptor anticipates launching quinsair in canada for the same indication for which it has received marketing approval in the second half of   in august the european patent office issued ep pat no    with claims covering raptor’s quinsair formulation this patent will expire in may  supplementing raptor’s  years of data exclusivity mp investigational form of quinsair raptor had a meeting with the fda in the second quarter concerning mp for the management of chronic pulmonary infections due to pseudomonas aeruginosa in adult patients with cystic fibrosis in the us the fda requested additional information pertinent to raptor’s existing trials prior to the company’s potential submission of an nda raptor submitted a response to the fdas request and expects to have additional discussions with the fdathe company intends to initiate a clinical study for mp in bronchiectasis be in  raptor plans to provide additional clarity on the timing of key activities once the study design has been finalized rp for huntington’s disease with current efforts focused on prioritizing clinical programs that represent raptor’s best use of current capital the company continues to explore nondilutive funding and partnering options for rp in huntington’s disease rp for mitochondrial diseases the second interim analysis which occurred after  patients completed  weeks of treatment indicated the ongoing trial should continue as planned which is currently ongoing anticipated upcoming milestones h  – potential quinsair launch in canada – advancement towards an nda submission for mp in cystic fibrosis in the us – initiation of a clinical study for mp in beh  – phase  rp data in mitochondrial diseases conference call and webcast information raptor will conduct a conference call and live audio webcast at  pm edt  pm pdt today the live call may be accessed by dialing   for domestic callers or   for international callers and using the conference id number  a live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investor relations section of the raptor website at wwwraptorpharmacom after the call a webcast replay will be available on the raptor website for  days while a telephone replay will be available for seven days this can be accessed by dialing   for domestic callers or   for international callers and using the conference id number  nongaap financial information and other disclosures raptor uses nongaap financial measures such as nongaap net loss nongaap net loss per share and nongaap operating expense to assess and analyze its operational results and trends provide operating expense guidance and to make financial and operational decisions raptor believes these nongaap financial measures are also useful to investors because they provide greater transparency regarding raptor’s operating performance and exclude noncash expenditures such as stock compensation amortization and impairment of iprd and change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to acquisitions these nongaap financial measures should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by gaap such as net loss net loss per share and total operating expense and should not be considered measures of raptor’s liquidity nongaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap and should only be used to supplement an understanding of raptor’s operating results as reported under gaap in addition these nongaap financial measures are unlikely to be comparable with nongaap information provided by other companies reconciliations between nongaap financial measures and gaap financial measures are included in the table accompanying this press release after the unaudited consolidated financial statements raptor has not provided a gaap reconciliation for its nongaap operating expense guidance measure because such measure is not available without unreasonable effort raptor cannot reliably predict the timing or likelihood of outcomes that determine future impairments or changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liability or factors that substantially contribute to the projection of stock compensation expense raptor is unable to predict the probable significance of these forwardlooking adjustments     about
