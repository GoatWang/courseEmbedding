content president peter dormans speechintroducing abdlatif yousef alhamad june   abdlatif alhamad is an individual whose vision of economic and social development in the arab world has been years ahead of its time a key ingredient of his vision for development is the idea of equitably sharing the worlds power and resources among all peoples of the globe in a speech given at aubs commencement exercises in  alhamad stated his firm conviction that in order to achieve this true sharing the true motive must be human solidarity and a commitment to international social justice born a citizen of kuwait abdlatif alhamad received his college education in the united states graduating in  with honors in international affairs from claremont mckenna college in california from there he went on to study at harvards international affairs program graduating in  his service to his native country began that same year when he served as a member of the kuwaiti un delegation during kuwaits initial application for united nations membership alhamads lifelong interest in economic development started concurrently as he served as director general of the kuwait investment company then later as kuwaits minister of finance and minister of planning alhamads global vision for the empowerment and development of societies is perhaps best illustrated by his long tenure yearsas director general of the arab fund for economic and social development since  the arab fund has sponsored and financed countless development programs in the arab world with special preference given to overall arab development and to joint arab projects encouraging the investment of private and public funds in arab projects and providing technical assistance services for arab economic and social development the focus has been on the development of infrastructure to encourage investment yet social services public health housing and education have always been priorities as well including funding for academic and applied research and institutional support and training notably the arab fund makes special arrangements for emergency projects including direct assistance to lebanon following the july war with israel in  alhamad has contributed his keen insights and perspectives to a number of educational institutions throughout the worldamong them our own university where he is a current member of aubs international advisory council he has served in a similar position with the university of chicagos center for middle eastern studies since  and with princeton universitys institute for the transregional study of the contemporary middle east north africa and central asia since  moreover he is a trustee of his alma mater claremont mckenna college kuwait university jordan university the vienna development institute the world institute for development economics research and the thailand development research institutejust a sampling of his global interests and dedication to higher education other affiliations attest to alhamads key concern for the environment in his opening address to the  meeting of icardas board of trustees alhamad highlighted with concern the arab regions food security and its unrealized agricultural potential and the crucial need to adopt more efficient water policies alhamad has always acknowledged the link between careful planning and resource allocation as the first step toward realization of such sweeping vision nor has he been daunted by local challenges he continues to endorse the millennium development goals in the arab countries especially progress in youth literacy gender equality and child mortality despite the weaknesses of national policies and the volatility of the region to bring social and economic progress to the
