periodic opportunities which we think may interest you click here to see a list of disclosures what happens if a company doesn’t reach its goal companies can set a minimum and maximum target goal investors review everything and if they decide to invest it’s as simple as clicking invest now and providing payment information all investments go directly to a bank escrow account within a short period of time at no times does jumpstart micro handle any funds the escrow agreement tells the bank to hold the funds collected until the end of the fund raising which is when the maximum target or deadline is met if the minimum is never met all funds collected are returned to the investors can i register as both an entrepreneur and investor yes you can but you need to register using two different email addresses what’s a good strategy for a company to raise money there is a misconception in the market that startups need to raise lots of money at high valuations it wasn’t always this way but a lack of capital available for startups has forced them to think big to attract venture capital raise what you need to operate your business and reach milestones remember you can raise up to  each year under title iii and raise more than once each year for example you might raise  to get to a prototype of your product at  per share then raise   months later at  per share with each round and proof of reaching milestones and achieving success your business value has increased and you can raise more at a high valuation with less dilution on the current shareholders have questions ask us
