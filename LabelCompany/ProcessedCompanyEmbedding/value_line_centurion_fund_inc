ranking system information to eam without charge or expense business environment the nations economy slowed during the fourth quarter of calendar  and then proceeded to grow even a little more anemically during the opening three months of calendar  with the us gross domestic product increasing just tepidly during the latest span setbacks in nonresidential fixed investment in part from declining energy sector capital spending in federal government spending and in exports were the principal drags on growth such weakness was offset to a degree by modest improvement in residential construction and consumer spending meanwhile the second quarter of calendar  likely saw some notable improvement underpinned by a strengthening in housing further increases in consumer spending and some emerging stability on the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing fronts to be sure gdp growth may still have been hampered by a weak export market excessive inventories and the aforementioned decline in the energysector capital spending but there should have been enough offsetting strength for the nations gross domestic product to have pushed forward solidly in the justconcluded three months thereafter some working down in inventories further strength in the housing and consumer spending areas aided by a presumptive acceleration in employment growth and a lessominous outlook in the energy markets should help generate reasonable levels of growth in the second half of this year such a prospect would likely enable the federal reserve to pursue slightly tighter monetary policies later in  or thereafter meanwhile the global outlook is still unsettled with slowing business growth in china the apparent british break from the european union continuing economic ills and ongoing terrorist threats and actions across parts of europe and periodic crises in the middle east including intermittent terrorism in that region headlining the problems offshore as we head toward the latter stages of  to date the us economy has remained quite well insulated from these global headwinds in all and assuming the ailing commodities markets are now stabilizing on a longterm basis our countrys gradual economic improvement should continue results of operations for fiscal years   and  the following table illustrates the companys key components of revenues and expenses fiscal years ended april

total gross sales             during the twelve months ended april   new sales of print and digital publications decreased as a percent of the total gross print and digital sales as a result of less aggressive promotion to firsttime customers at introductory prices conversion and renewal sales orders increased over fiscal  outpacing the decrease in new sales orders as a result of increased success by our inhouse retail and institutional sales departments during the twelve months ended april   new sales of print publications decreased as a percent of the total gross sales while conversion and renewal revenues increased from fiscal  as a result of increased resources of the inhouse telemarketing department new sales of digital products in fiscal  showed a marked increase over

above april   the decline from april   reflects curtailed advertising for order generation further a certain amount of variation is to be expected due to the volume of new orders and timing of renewal orders direct mail campaigns and higher priced institutional sales orders investment periodicals and related publications revenues investment periodicals and related publications revenues decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal  the company continued its efforts to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels primarily direct mail email and by the efforts of our sales personnel total product line circulation at april   was  below total product line circulation at april   the company has been successful in growing revenues from digitallydelivered investment periodicals within the institutional market institutional sales generated total sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april   which were  or  above comparable total sales orders of  for the twelve months ended april   this growth continues a positive trend for institutional sales but is not sufficient to wholly offset the lost revenues from retail subscribers we have also benefited from converting some customers from lower cost retail to the more robust professional priced services digital publications revenues during the twelve months ended

april   including an increase in the introductory lowerpriced value line  print product the vl  was utilized during fiscal  and the latter part of  as a retail leadgeneration product though revenue from expiring fullprice subscriptions has not been matched by the initial revenue from new promotional retail orders our retail sales and marketing personnel have made an effort to renew and upgrade the new customers the company has marketed the value line  and digital investor  services as starter products to familiarize new customers with our services at attractive prices the company seeks to expand familiarity with our brand through this means exposing our offerings to new customers who heretofore may not have been familiar with our services our goal is to introduce these investors to value line and ultimately to attract many to additional premiumpriced services targeted at their specific needs for investment research on various classes of equities including mutual funds and etfs such a stepup strategy has been seen in the fasterthanexpected acceptance of the value line  service featuring an expanded mix of established and newersmaller companies by a number of newtothecompany investor  and the value line  subscribers moreover by growing our active customer base the retail sales team and marketing staff have thousands more subscribers to whom they offer our more sophisticated services the brand exposure philosophy is additionally reinforced by our selective efforts to join forces with other well respected financial industry participants through our copyright data and other distribution efforts under our institutional services umbrella investment periodicals and related publications revenues decreased  or  for the twelve months ended april   as compared to fiscal  total product line circulation at april   was  above total product line circulation at april   continuing a positive trend of increased subscribers at modestly lower average prices

total print circulation at april   was  above total print circulation at april   including a  increase in the introductory lowerpriced value line  print product the vl  was utilized during fiscal  as a retail lead generation product the company has relied more on its personnel selling efforts in both the institutional segment and retail retention and sales as the ability to obtain orders profitably through traditional direct marketing plateaus the majority of the companys subscribers have traditionally been individual investors who generally receive printed publications via us mail on a weekly basis individual investors interested in digitallydelivered investment information have access to both free and subscription equity research from many sources continuing factors that have contributed to the decline in the retail digital investment periodicals and related publications revenues include competition in the form of free or low cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no direct cost to their clients further there appears to be a relative decline in individuals interest in holding specific stocks as compared with etfs mutual funds and participation in retirement plans in order to address competition the company has emphasized its lowerpriced starter levels of service in attracting new customers also many of the professional subscribers to the companys digital and print retail products have been successfully converted to a higher priced institutional product with the peak impact of such movement behind us the company offers quality publications on mutual funds and exchange traded funds but they have achieved only modest market share value line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks who pay primarily on annual subscription plans for basic services or as much as  or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research not obtainable elsewhere the ongoing goal of adding new subscribers has led us to experiment with varying terms for our reliable proprietary research including a period of intensive promotion of starter services and publications copyright data fees the value line proprietary ranking system information the ranking system a component of the companys flagship product the value line investment survey is also utilized in the companys copyright data business the ranking system is made available to eam for specific uses without charge the ranking system is designed to be predictive over a six to twelve month period for the six month periods ended

twelve months ended april   copyright data fees of  were  below fiscal  as of april   total third party sponsored assets were attributable to three contracts for copyright data representing  billion in various products as compared to four contracts for copyright data representing  billion in assets at april   the value of assets managed by third party sponsors was affected by reassigning assets

copyright data fees were  and total third party sponsored assets were attributable to four contracts for copyright data representing  billion in various products in assets at april   the company believes this part of the business is dependent upon the desire of third parties to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products on competition and on fluctuations in
