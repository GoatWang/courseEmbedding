sylkatis acg texas lp  overall    ease of use    features  functionality    customer support    value for money comments acg texas initiated our first payment run with nvp on  since that time i worked with nvp to successfully implement this payment solution process with the other three companies under the summit restaurant group umbrella we find the system very userfriendly for our companies and our vendors maneuvering through the screens is very easy and required very little training we use some of the reports while researching vendor statements and find it has streamlined that previously arduous task the ach and cc payment process have reduced the number of requests to void and reissue checks due to nonreceipt which in turn has reduced bank fees obviously we have enjoyed reduced costs when compared to paying vendors with a check  check stock envelopes postage fees and administrative staff labor and have found the rebate program to be very lucrative the customer service staff is typically extremely courteous and helpful they understand the sense of urgency to resolve any challenges we have encountered i would like to see the site speed increased moving through screens or searching for vendor data additionally i would like to see the parameters that i set up remain in place when i hit the back button other than these issues we find the process and people at nvoicepay
