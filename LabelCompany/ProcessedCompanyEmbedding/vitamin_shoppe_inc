user muscled muscle maximized  home       research update can this little red capsule help you pack on bigtime muscle universitytested gelcap helped novice bodybuilders pack on impressive muscle — can it work for you too heres what you need to know  as featured in   weighttraining athletes who supplemented their diets with a newly discovered fatty acid isomer experienced a  increase in lean muscle growth and a fold increase in biceps girth over placebo breaking —  a new dietary supplement containing a pair of specialized fatty acid growth factors is the hottest thing going in amateur athletics — but not without controversy critics say the compounds — cis tr conjugated linioleic acid and phosphatidylserine ps provided in the controversial new supplement ct  — gives athletes an unfair advantage and their use should be prohibited by athletes proponents argue research shows the compounds to be both safe and effective and is a natural musclebuilding alternative similar to creatine monohydrate one thing people on both sides can agree on is the controversial new supplement seems to really work according to a recent study published in the journal medicine  science  sports and medicine novice weight trainers who took these compounds for seven weeks experienced a  increase in lean muscle growth including a fold increase in biceps girth another study published in the same journal found that in weighttraining athletes these growthfactors increased overall muscle strength by  percent within just  weeks — with zero side effects fair game or unfair advantage athletes who supplemented with these natural growth factors for seven weeks packed on six times more muscle and added  pounds to their bench press compared to the guys given a placebo wordofmouth marketing has led to ct  rivaling creatine and preworkout nitric oxide no supplements as the most popular natural performanceenhancers in amateur athletic locker rooms however critics  say these compounds too closely mimic the effects of anabolic steroids and that their use should be prohibited by athletes  to be sure steroids similar to these compounds work in large part by minimizing the catabolic effects of cortisol allowing for greater amino acid uptake nitrogen retention and protein synthesis many sports scientists however say the compounds are a viable alternative to dangerous performanceenhancing drugs they point to the fact that these compounds are isolated from natural food sources and are therefore no different ethically from highcarbohydrate food mixes for aerobic athletes besides they say research has shown them to be medically safe and that we should emphasize that the alternative to these natural compounds is steroids unreal size and strength gains  whether or not using ct

freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
