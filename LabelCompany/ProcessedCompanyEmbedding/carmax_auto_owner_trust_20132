credit quality compared to recent  pools the weighted average fico score is  with consistent internal credit tiers while vehicle age condition and ltvs are slightly above recent  pools stable portfoliosecuritization performance losses on carmax auto finances caf portfolio and  securitizations have declined in recent years due to stronger quality originations and elevated used vehicle values which have supported higher recovery rates higher credit enhancement the cash flow distribution in  is a sequentialpay structure initial hard credit enhancement ce in  for the class a notes totals  up from  in  and  ce is adequate to cover fitchs base case loss coverage levels unstable macroeconomic conditions a slower recovery and potential for volatility could affect delinquencies and losses fitchs analysis accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the recent recession in the base case loss analysis stable origination underwriting and servicing platform fitch believes caf demonstrates adequate abilities as originator underwriter and servicer to service  integrity of the legal structure the legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of caf would not impair the timeliness of the payments on the securities rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of carmax auto owner trust  to increased losses over the life of the transaction fitchs analysis found that each class of notes displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses showing potential downgrades of one category under fitchs moderate x base case loss scenario each class of notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories under fitchs severe x base case loss scenario key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report the presale report is available to all investors on fitchs website at wwwfitchratingscom for more information
