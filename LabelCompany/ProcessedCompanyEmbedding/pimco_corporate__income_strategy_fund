navigate rates navigate rates investment risks such as changing interest rates may present opportunities for fixedincome solutions consider a nontraditional approach for navigating interest rates with columbia threadneedle investments predicting how and when interest rates will change can frustrate investors and leave advisors uncertain on a strategy instead of viewing fluctuations as an obstacle to your clients’ goals consider them an opportunity we’ve created a nontraditional strategy to endure changing rates and thrive in all markets — helping you navigate todays fluctuating market and guide your clients toward success four major risk factors duration credit inflation and currency risk are all drivers of fixedincome performance and they affect investments differently we believe that a multisector approach that capitalizes on all four risk factors may lead to better or more diversified outcomes across market cycles in each case below one of the four risk factors dominates the overall risk profile which subjects investors to a narrow range of potential outcomes for a closer look at when these risks are most and least attractive read our white paper harnessing fixedincome returns through the cycle how different risks drive performance of common bond indices source blackrock solutions  duration risk a traditional fixedincome portfolio which typically invests in highquality governmentrelated bonds can leave investors vulnerable to the performance of one single risk factor — duration also known as interest rate risk duration represents the price volatility of a longterm investment in a changing interest rate environment the longer you hold an investment the more impact interest rate changes will likely have on returns exhibit  performance of credit versus growth and valuation credit risk the chance of a borrower defaulting on a debt is known as credit risk it’s highly cyclical and the best returns tend to occur in periods just after episodes of underperformance — when investor sentiment begins to shift future returns tend to be significantly higher when bonds are cheaper as seen in exhibit  exhibit  performance of inflation versus inflation expectations inflation risk inflation risk or purchasing power risk is the chance that the rate of inflation will exceed the rate of return on your investment this risk is driven by both actual and expected future rate of inflation it performs best when the economy is overheating and prices and wages are rising the more inflation exceeds expectations the better inflation risk performs exhibit  performance of currency versus global yield changes currency risk currency risk is the risk of loss when an investor has exposure to foreigncurrencytraded investments —which is common for investments in global bond markets it’s important to be aware of the trend in global bond yields relative to the us when incorporating currency risk into your bond portfolio foreign currency returns rise as
