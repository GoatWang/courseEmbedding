inquiry stagnant ip overhyped ces awards and ugly financialsmay   about vuzix corp vuzi the geoteam longshort equity growth at reasonable price value arbitragegeoinvesting llcsummaryvuzix corporation is a promoted stock with a history of ugly financials including negative cash flow negative margins and a consistent reliance on equity sales to fund its businessthe company admits in its k that it has had an ongoing informal sec inquiry related to its financials since may of ces awards that the company consistently touts are awarded to hundreds of conference participants and appear to have minimal requirements for qualificationvuzix appears to have not updated its iphoneandroid apps since  and the full launch of its m product supposedly in full production in q has yet to commencedilutive equity raises are likely needed to continue to fund operations which will put continued shortterm pressure on shares of vuzi contributed by fg alpha management for geoinvesting llc introduction there is little doubt that the augmented reality and virtual reality space is going to be a fastgrowing market over the next decade however we feel that vuzix nasdaqvuzi investors may have their heads in the optimism clouds as the reality of vuzis performance and credibility of management may not match the potential of the sector in order to survive we think that vuzix needs either significant proprietary technology or a vibrant user base with a robust developer ecosystem the company appears to have neither the company has told investors that its newest offering its m glasses has been in full production since q the product is still only offered as a preorder on the companys website and our calls to the company about a launch date led a sales representative to tell us they had no idea when the launch would commence missed deadlines and lack of wide sales have led analysts covering vuzi like maxim to reduce or push back their revenue estimates each time they renew coverage of the company we predict the company will yet again miss revenue estimates when it reports this week additionally several ces awards that the company has heavily promoted over the last few years actually look as though they were simply honorable mentions a distinction widely sprayed on over  products at last years ces conference while retail investors remain hopeful about the companys future  or  years down the road we want to call focus to an ongoing sec inquiry that is happening right now the informal inquiry as the company describes it in its k has been taking place with a focus on the companys financials since may of  could this inquiry potentially be looking into cash leaving the company to any number of consultants finally the companys financials remain distressed and there is little doubt that it will need to issue equity to survive at this rate while the company has been able to raise funding through chardan  not exactly goldman sachs  we expect the quality of future raises to get worse and their corresponding dilutive effects to also get worse for shareholders competition  no new product development the augmented realityvirtual reality market is as yet undeveloped but already faces a staggering amount of competition a recent piece by techcrunch called the reality of arvr competition shows approximately  competitors in the market theres an old adage in venture capital what will you do when google nasdaqgoog nasdaqgoogl enters your market in the case of vuzix what will it do now that google apple nasdaqaapl facebook nasdaqfb sony nysesne samsung otcssnlf microsoft nasdaqmsft nokia nysenok garmin nasdaqgrmn fitbit nysefit qualcomm nasdaqqcom blackberry nasdaqbbry and about  others have already entered their market in the case of vuzixs up and coming products its m model is supposed to be the next big release from the company in march the company gave an outlook on its conference call that indicated the product was in full production the m is now in full production but the end of this we should be at production run rate of  to  per month were unparallel sic bring up asian manufacturing lines to lower cost and expand production capacity the m is also on a continual software optimization program where software update being rolled out on a regular basis it also blamed the poor sales of the companys m product on customers ostensibly waiting for the m release since weve first introduced the m its the indiscernible in  many customers have been waiting for it and its been reflected in our lower sales of the m during the year finally the company states that the m is rolling off the production line it claims it wanted to be at a run rate of  units per month by the end of the first quarter for comparative purposes this same process took over six months to complete for m the bottomline the m is now rolling off the production line which taken every day and have orders like every coming off the lines with growing demand as we move from vips and start turning migration orders sic finally we will shortly be opening to the m to general customers in the middle market production is also running and we expect a consistent run rate of approximately  units per month at the end of this quarter of only trend of early q with vuzix enterprise sales team has not sat idle during this early late stage of m its now q and the m is still only available for preorder on the companys website in addition we phoned vuzix on may   to try and get information as to when preorders for the m would begin shipping the sales representative we spoke to told us that they had no idea and directed us to fill out an online inquiry form which we did we have yet to receive information on a release date for the product intellectual property stagnation the company claimed on its most recent conference call that its patent portfolio has increased by nine new patentspending patents finally over the last year or so vuzixs patent portfolio have increased with the total amount of nine new patent and patent spending let me just wrap up quickly here  is already proven to be a pivotal year for vuzix and the entire smart glasses industry we have b focus on the enterprise market as the m ramps into production but when we searched for patents on our own we reached different conclusions based on a search of the uspto patent application database it appears the company failed to even file a single patent in  in fact the most recent patent application is as of september   according to our search from the latest k vuzixs products appear to include little in the way of proprietary hardware technology we do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for microdisplays one of the key components in our products furthermore we do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets optics microdisplays backlights printed circuit boards or other electronic components which are used in our products given that vuzixs glasses run on outside software as well android the company faces vertical integration challenges on just about every level we believe that the physical design of the glasses is appealing but aside from the aesthetic appearance of the device itself we are left questioning what vuzix has that could be considered a durable edge a statement made by vuzix board member and newly appointed coo paul boris seems to acknowledge the lack of sustainable differentiation among devicemakers outside of his board duties boris is ge corps nysege vice president of manufacturing industries in an article by it world canada in january of this year boris described how ge is overseeing pilot programs to test four ar headsets including vuzixs as he put it the device on some level is a commodity its just a mechanism for serving the data in the right context he further stated well try all of them cadaverous software ecosystem in the absence of a clear hardware advantage we looked to the companys software ecosystem the company states in its recent k we are building an ecosystem of developers around these smart glasses we find little evidence to suggest that these efforts have been successful to date the company apps in the android and apple stores show very little activity the android store shows  ratings and four reviews as displayed below almost comically one positive review appears to be written by vuzix ceo paul travers himself with the second positive review appearing to be written by vuzixs manufacturing consultant thomas hasselberg among the nonemployees of vuzix the two reviews were both negative and stated the following dahita november  unable to connect to the glasses from a galaxy a  on android  impossible to connect to the glasses even though the bt connection happened smoothly very frustrating as there are no help available tradewind clipper november  doesnt do much apparently no way to installupdate apps or firmware on glasses most preinstalled apps on glasses skype instagram etc are unusable app is totally different from vuzix documentation despite the deficiencies outlined by the above users the app was last updated on android on september   it appears that nobody is home the apple store app seems even less active as there are not enough ratings for the vuzix app to even display the rating the app was launched in june  and was last updated november of the same year in order to make significant inroads into ar vuzix will need to compete against large companies that already have thriving ecosystems given the above we not only question whether vuzix will be successful but also whether it is even earnestly attempting to compete vuzis overhyped ces awards one of the key points that lends apparent credence to vuzixs technology is the validation earned through numerous awards at the ces conference the consumer technology association is the owner and operator of the ces showcase an annual event spotlighting innovative consumer technology every year at ces companies enter their products into the innovation award contest aiming to win industry recognition entries are submitted to  award categories and the highest rated product or technology in each category is awarded the best of innovation title vuzix ostensibly performs extremely well at the ces competitions which it has repeatedly noted in press releases and its sec filings examples include a november  press release by the company announcing vuzix awarded four ces  innovation awards for its upcoming blade  smart sunglasses similarly in november  the company announced vuzix awarded eight ces  innovation awards including best of in gaming and virtual reality for iwearÂ® wireless video headphones despite heavily promoting these awards a closer look shows that for the most part rather than winning the coveted best ofâ¦ category vuzixs products are usually deemed honorees according to the ces website an honoree simply denotes a product or technology that scores above the threshold set for a specific category the threshold doesnt seem particularly limiting according to the contest rules a product is qualified for entry as an honoree merely by paying entry fees and filling in all the sections of its online entry tool in  alone there were approximately  total honorees vuzix seems to be hyping its wins while in most cases it is simply one of hundreds of honorees that are awarded participation trophies for paying the fee and satisfying basic minimum criteria in one instance when vuzix actually won the best of designation it didnt seem able to translate the victory into meaningful product adoption in january  vuzix won the best of award in gaming and virtual reality but despite winning the accolade the company sold only  iwear sets that year furthermore per the company k filed december  vuzix took an inventory writedown on its iwear product citing intense competition and pricing pressures the company wrote down to net realizable value all of its component and finished goods inventory related to its iwear video headphones resulting from the decision in early  to reduce the suggested retail selling price to a price below the cost the total write down provision totaled â¦ source k pgs  from the amazon reviews of the iwear none of the nine verified purchaser reviews rated the product above  stars the product garnered an overall rating of  stars across its  ratings by vuzixs account it appears the product may not have actually been ready for full production despite entering iwear into the ces competition and ultimately winning from the same filing we see that vuzix took a hit on its manufacturing and overhead costs due to a need to rework the iwear manufacturing process midyear manufacturing overhead costs rose primarily due to increased salaries and production labor costs of  with over half related to iwear rework costing source k pgs  part of this awardwinning flop might be explained by again examining the rules of the ces competition the entry and judging process for the competition states that a product sample isnt even required although judges may ask for one were unclear on the value of a contest that issues awards when judges arent even required to test the very products they are judging given the above we question the companys ability to translate the ces awards to actual shareholder value under the best of circumstances stock promoters pushing vuzi in  vuzix reported revenue of only  representing a  drop from the previous year however despite a failure to generate meaningful product sales the company has been very successful at selling its stock via secondary offerings in  the company raised  through two common stock offerings source k page  the larger of the two offerings was a november  offering for  with chardan capital markets acting as sole placement agent chardan happens to be one of two analysts covering vuzix with a buy rating in case there was any doubt we are uninspired by the fact that vuzix generated almost x more cash from stock sales than from revenue but we also find it predictable given the apparent dedication to stock promotion efforts beginning in early  the company appeared in several paid microcap promotional sites including the tech stock report and microcapresearchcom in vuzixs company profile in the tech stock report the website acknowledges receiving  as of march  from two entities third coast media llc and sunrise media llc payment was described as being for the preparation of the profile and other marketing and investor relations services third coast media llc appears to be a wyoming business registered to steve naremore editor of penny stock website stockcommandercom and matthew watabe director at website ragingbullcom which features an array of millionaire traders and experts we were unable to find more details on sunrise media llc which is believed to be a shell entity another promotional website microcapresearch published several articles on vuzix and acknowledged the receipt of  from one article and  for another from an unrelated third party we did not perform an exhaustive search of stock promotional websites for more paid material touting vuzix beyond external stock promotion efforts vuzix has relentlessly promoted token corporate accomplishments via its own press releases the company issued  press releases during  alone touting numerous appearances at industry trade shows investor conferences and sponsorships among other items vuzi remains in financial distress for the second year in a row vuzix reported weaknesses in disclosure and internal financial controls any sign of material weakness is concerning but we find this to be even more so given how bad vuzixs financials look as is many of vuzixs key metrics appear as if pulled from a dream sequence in alice in wonderland in  the company had a gross margin of  in other words it cost vuzi  more to produce the goods than the goods actually sold for freight costs accounted for  of the cost of sales such high freight rates may make sense if shipping steel beams via helicopter but vuzix is shipping lightweight headsets and glasses that retail for up to  the company has increased its operating loss with remarkable consistency operating losses have increased in each of the past five years with a fiveyear cagr of  the company generated  cents in sales per every dollar invested in sales and marketing the company has not only consistently slowed sales over the past five years but its products have also become less profitable sales have grown at a fiveyear cagr of  while cogs has grown at a fiveyear cagr of  beyond headline figures the company shows several troubling irregularities from  to  research  development costs increased over  jumping from  to  despite the massive surge in rd the company failed to even file a single patent in  based on a search of the uspto patent application database as noted above the most recent patent application is as of september   according to our search despite the apparent lack of patentable advancements the justification for this massive increase is described by the company as follows the majority of these amounts being spent on outside contractors which assisted in the development work source vuzi  k we would be interested to learn more about these outside contractors that assisted in the rd and accounted for the majority of the cost increases from  to  sga also increased over  jumping from  to  vuzi k pg  this cost spike occurred despite an apparent reduction in headcount from  to  the company cut its fulltime north american staff in sales and marketing distribution and customer service from seven to six european staff of three contractors remained the same vuzixs filings acknowledge that it has a small european office but the address listed on their contact page is the address of their european auditor king loose  co see king loose  co contact us page available here see vuzix europe ltd  full accounts available here david lock is the director of operations emea region for vuzix europe ltd his consulting firm drl associates ltd drl is located at the same address and is also audited by king loose  co see companyhouse vuzix europe limited available here king loose appears to be a very small shop which may support the control issues identified by vuzixs auditor sec conducting inquiry as company sprays money to consultants the company has also been undergoing an informal inquiry by the securities and exchange commission which it disclosed in  as the company states in its current risk factors disclosures on may   we received a letter from the sec dated may   notifying us that the sec is conducting an informal inquiry relating to us and requesting that we produce certain documents relating to our internal control over financial reporting we have produced the requested documents and thus far have not received requests for additional information if in connection with this informal inquiry the sec determines to take action against us our financial position could be adversely affected while we know that the inquiry is related to the companys financial reporting as that is what it discloses we are left with little detail after that perhaps the companys aggressive use of consultants and third parties to develop its products could be at the center of an investigation like this in the same filing vuzix described the costly external contractors in relation to its rd spend in a year where vuzix doesnt appear to have filed for new us patents or updated its software we cant help but wonder where the money went conclusion vuzi still has a questionable past and unproven future we strongly believe the arvr market could grow substantially over the next five years we have already seen small successes in augmented reality like the launch of pokÃ©mon go vuzi may also attempt to continue controlling the narrative despite poor financial numbers by touting future potential products and possible partnerships while we believe these statements will ultimately prove to be meaningless unless the company can produce in its financials investors should make themselves aware of the risks associated with companies that are pumped through paid promotions that supplement rosysounding narratives but the reality of the situation should be clear with this sectorwide inflection point for arvr still in the future we believe investors need to address the harsh realities of vuzis business as it operates today with a heavily crowded field and the lack of a clear intellectual property advantage we believe vuzi isnt anywhere as close to catching and riding this wave as investors think management has incessantly touted the potential of its products but a history littered with manufacturing delays and murky sales guidance doesnt inspire confidence while some could argue that financials dont matter at this stage in the game because vuzi is a development company that doesnt change the fact that it is likely going to need more cash injections from stock sales in order to continue its business as we already stated these stock sales will likely become progressively more dilutive as the companys needs accelerate going long vuzi is a bet that the company is going to introduce something groundbreaking and cash generative against all odds before the dilutive effects of financing wear the value of shares too thin this is a bet that we just dont think is worth it disclaimer you agree that you shall not republish or redistribute in any
