qlt naic  pharmaceutical preparation manufacturing qlt inc is a biotechnology company that develops and markets photodynamic therapeutic products—drugs that are activated by exposure to light the company has a history of developing treatments for cancer but its greatest commercial success is visudyne a lightactivated treatment for agerelated macular degeneration the leading cause of blindness in people over age  other pharmaceutical products in the companys development pipeline include treatments for prostate cancer skin cancer and male pattern baldness the acquisition of atrix laboratories in  gave qlt a second marketable pharmaceutical product named eligard which is a treatment for advanced prostate cancer origins without question the single most influential figure in qlts history was dr julia levy whose pioneering scientific work achieved commercial success when she was forced to trade her lab coat for the attire of a chief executive officer levy was born julia coppens in  beginning her life in singapore where her father worked as an executive for a dutch bank levys father guillaume coppens sent his wife and two daughters to stay with relatives in british columbia canada on the eve of world war ii fearing for his familys safety guillaume coppenss anxiety was justified he was captured by the japanese and interned in indonesia surviving the ordeal but devastated by the experience he joined his family in british columbia after the war unable to work for the remainder of his life my recollection of my life was dont upset your father levy reflected in a july   interview with contemporary canadian biographies  levys mother who served as the motivation for qlts greatest commercial success supported the family by working as a physiotherapist after high school levy spent a year serving as a file clerk at bc hydro to supplement the scholarships she had earned to attend the university of british columbia where she studied microbiology and immunology after earning her undergraduate degree in  levy went overseas to obtain her doctorate attending the university of londons national institute for medical research she earned her phd in experimental pathology in  and returned to the university of british columbia where she began conducting research on cancer after her first marriage ended in divorce levy married a physicist at the university of british columbia named edwin levy the couple married in  and several years later purchased a holiday property on sonora island in british columbia where they planned to build a cottage it was the turning point in levys career after a decade of conducting research levy had little to show for her efforts at least in comparison to what she produced after she handed a machete to her son ben and asked him to clear the weeds on the property ben who was born during levys first marriage was seven years old at the time and he took to the task with zeal slashing away at the underbrush with what amounted to a sword ben came across some cow parsley and hacked away at it with sufficient enthusiasm to cover his skin in fluid from the plant it was a hot day ben remembered in a july   interview with the vancouver sun  describing the fateful day on sonora island the sun came out and all of a sudden i just started blistering everywhere especially on my arms when levy returned to work she asked her colleagues at the university of british columbia about what might have caused her sons skin to blister she learned that a substance in cow parsleys leaves can attack and destroy certain kinds of tissue skin cells included but only when activated by exposure to light levy was intrigued and began thinking about the potential of photoactivated drugs embarking on research that would lead to her coinvention of photodynamic therapy pdt levys work focused on a twostep process that began with the intravenous injection of a drug after the drug entered the patients bloodstream it collected where abnormal blood vessels were being formed once the drug was concentrated around the flawed blood vessels it was activated by a dose of nonthermal laser light triggering a process that destroyed abnormal cells while levys scientific research found a pioneering and focused direction her work with a team of researchers at the university of british columbia centered on studying antibodies for treating various forms of cancer guiding a drug through development the various stages of regulatory approval and through numerous clinical trials represented one of the most arduous and timeconsuming achievements in the business world a monumental task that was even more challenging for the research team in vancouver in the beginning of the s the canadian biotechnology industry did not exist at the time the only way to produce a drug was to sell the rights to a foreign pharmaceutical company levy and her colleagues turned to the university of british columbia for support but the university refused with nowhere else to turn and wishing to remain in control of their discoveries the research team decided to start their own business in  levy mortgaged her house to come up with  a sum matched by her cofounders john brown jim miller anthony phillips and ron mackenzie they named their company quadra logic technologies renting one room above a bakery to house their office and laboratory each of the founders continued to work at the university unable to draw a salary from their fledgling venture and conducted their research above the bakery during off hours in many respects quadra logic or qlt as the company eventually became known served as levys vehicle to deliver her scientific findings to the commercial market starting out in  however levy and her colleagues were many years away from enjoying any commercial success the path describing a drugs progression from discovery through development regulatory approval and commercialization promised to be an unnerving journey—particularly for a group not versed in the intricacies of clearing regulatory and clinical hurdles because the market in the united states was integral to the companys success approval needed to be obtained from the us food and drug administration fda requiring a process that levy later described as akin to playing russian roulette as quoted in the october   issue of canadian chemical news and thats really ugly because youre not the master of your fate she added photofrin in the mids the young qlt scored its first success with a drug that already had begun progressing along the path toward commercialization levy convinced her partners to acquire the rights to photofrin a lightactivated drug in the midst of clinical trials as a cancer treatment in  qlt formed an alliance with a larger pharmaceutical company—something nearly every small biotechnology company like qlt needed to do to survive the company reached an agreement with american cyanamid to codevelop photofrin brokering a deal that gave it equity which enabled it to fund the drugs development the alliance was important for another reason because american cyanamid practiced in the vagaries of drug development and clinical trials provided the qlt team with an invaluable tutorial in shepherding a drug through to commercialization that was a very fortunate experience for us levy reflected in an october  interview with canadian chemical news  because with biotechnology companies theyll take the science forward to a certain level and then theyll license it out to a large pharma company and the pharma company will say thank you very much well see you later and does the development the partnership ended before photofrin gained approval but it ended on beneficial terms for qlt american cyanamid was acquired by another company in the early s which gave the rights to photofrin back to qlt which by that point had another drug in its development pipeline the idea for the drug came from levy who drew her inspiration for developing photodynamic therapy from her son and her motivation for creating what would be her careers crowning achievement from her mother the development of visudyne in the s during the mids levys mother began to lose her sight she was diagnosed with agerelated macular degeneration an incurable deterioration of the central portion of the retina and the leading cause of blindness in people over the age of  levy had spent her entire career studying cancer and she noticed a similarity between macular degeneration and her chosen field of study both diseases manifested themselves by forming new abnormal tissue levys mother suffered from wet macular degeneration in which flawed blood vessels bleed under the retina damaging the lightsensitive membrane at the back of the eye levy focused her work on developing a drug that targeted the abnormal blood vessels and destroyed them when activated by light eventually creating qlts defining pharmaceutical product visudyne company perspectives qlt has the capability to maximize all the exciting products in our development pipeline and leverage our unique drug delivery technologies we are also actively seeking to expand our pipeline through both inhouse development and external alliances combining the best in science and business all of us at qlt are committed to helping enrich the lives of thousands of patients the development of visudyne became a crusade of sorts for levy one whose success was jeopardized when qlts partnership with american cyanamid was terminated between  and  the companys survival was at stake as it sought to navigate on its own levy recalled the period in her october  interview with canadian chemical news  remembering really putting on blinkers and just concentrating on trying to get approval for photofrin and taking our preclinical work with visudyne forward she added we could have gone under then if we hadnt taken very major measures to pull ourselves together and focus focus focus after a decade of work qlt received the nod of approval it had labored to obtain in  when photofrin was accepted by the fda as a marketable drug qlt became the only company with approval to market a lightactivated pharmaceutical product in the field of photodynamic therapy winning approval for her first drug was a celebratory moment for levy but she barely had time to mark the occasion before her responsibilities broadened all of qlts other founders departed in  leaving levy who had served variously as the companys chief scientific officer and vicepresident as the only one to lead the company before the year was through levy accepted the titles of president and chief executive officer becoming the companys corporate and scientific leader as it endeavored to win approval for its second drug visudyne commercial success in the s under levys leadership qlt recorded the greatest financial growth in its history photofrin gave the company the steady stream of revenue it had worked for years to secure but the lifeblood of its operations visudyne would deliver qlts most strident financial growth visudyne won approval from the fda in  the same year levy sold photofrin to quebecbased axcan pharma inc qlt won approval for visudyne which it marketed in partnership with novartis ophthalmics in april recording its first sales from the drug in the second fiscal quarter of  when the company collected  million during the second quarter of  the company generated  million from the sale of visudyne as its use spread throughout more than  countries the us market represented the companys single biggest market accounting for twothirds of visudyne sales and enabling it to join an elite group of biotechnology companies of the  publicly traded biotechnology companies around the world levy declared in the winter  issue of buyside only  are profitable and qlt is one of them visudyne is an important reason for our growth she added it was the largest ophthalmic product launch on record with sales of  million in the first  months after years of working to bring visudyne to market and watching its sales mushroom with each passing fiscal quarter levy decided to give up her management responsibilities at qlt she departed in  after  years at the company passing the titles of president and chief executive officer to paul hastings hastings started his career in the pharmaceutical industry in  with hoffman la roche the first of several companies he worked for in the industry before joining qlt hastings served as president and ceo of axys pharmaceuticals hastingss task at qlt was one levy presumably would not have relished sales of visudyne continued to rise as the reins of leadership passed from levy to hastings but analysts demanded more qlt was dependent almost entirely on the sale of visudyne a dependence that some industry observers described as a weakness one analyst in the january   issue of the americas intelligence wire  typified the assessment of qlt by the financial community saying the big issue for them is what are you going to do next although visudyne was the only treatment for macular degeneration on the market qlt was expected to contend with its first competition as early as  when eyetech a biotechnology company working in collaboration with pfizer inc was expected to win approval for its macular degeneration drug macugen hastingss challenge was to build qlts business beyond visudyne the company had two other products under development tariquidar a cancer treatment and qlt a male baldness treatment but hastings realized he needed to take a more aggressive approach to augmenting the companys business in early  he earmarked  million in cash to develop the companys product pipeline and quell analysts cries for a more diversified product offering we are looking to continue to build the pipeline by bringing inhouse new technologies licensing things in and making acquisitions of products or companies hastings announced in the february   issue of investors business daily  toward this end hastings completed a deal that promised a more a balanced qlt in the years ahead in november  qlt completed a merger with atrix laboratories inc a specialty pharmaceutical company with a pipeline of products and drug delivery platforms among the immediate gains of the merger was qlts ability to market one of atrixs products eligard a treatment for prostate cancer as hastings prepared for the future further deals were expected as he sought to build on levys legacy and

million breakup fee are reflected as part of selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss income table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods presented significant estimates are used for but not limited to the fair value of contingent consideration allocation of overhead expenses to research and development stockbased compensation and provisions for taxes uncertain tax positions tax assets and tax liabilities actual results may differ from estimates made by management the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those which follow contingent consideration when contingent consideration assets arise they are measured at fair value and revalued at the end of each reporting period furthermore fair value changes are reported as part of other expense income related to continuing operations fair value changes in contingent consideration are positively impacted by the passage of time since all remaining expected cash flows are closer to collection thereby increasing their present value fair value changes in contingent consideration are also impacted by the projected amount and timing of expected future cash flows as well as the cost of capital used to discount these cash flows as described under note   contingent consideration of the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   we are currently in dispute with valeant related to a  million earnout milestone the laser earnout payment which is payable to qlt under the terms of the valeant agreement on december   qlt commenced an action against valeant for breach of contract related to this matter as at december   the laser earnout payment is recorded in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at its estimated fair value of  million    million to reflect the collection risk associated with the valeant dispute and litigation during the year ended december   we recorded a  million decrease in the estimated fair value of the laser earnout payment to account for the potential collection costs increased uncertainty and assessed collection risk in  and  the fair value of the laser earnout payment was estimated using a probability weighted approach to examine the various possible outcomes with respect to the timing and amount net of collection costs that may be collected stockbased compensation accounting standards codification asc topic  requires stockbased compensation to be recognized as compensation expense in the statement of earnings based on their fair values on the date of the grant with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which a grantee is required to provide services in exchange for the stock award compensation expense recognition provisions are applicable to new awards as well as any awards modified repurchased or cancelled after the adoption date we use the blackscholes option pricing model to estimate the value of our stock option awards at each grant date the blackscholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of such options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable in addition option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility we project expected volatility and the expected life of such options based on historical and other economic data trended into future years the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates that coincide with the terms of our options for the year ended december   stockbased compensation expense of  million was expensed as

preclinical and clinical projects in fields such as ophthalmology dermatology oncology and urology we also conduct contract research and development work on product candidates of third parties from

we undertake no obligation to update or revise the statements ii table of contents risk factors       in addition to the other information included in this registration statement you should consider carefully the following factors which describe the risks uncertainties and other factors that may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we are identifying these as important factors that could cause actual events or our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  made by us or on our behalf in this registration statement or elsewhere we are relying upon the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements and any such statements are qualified by reference to the cautionary statements set out elsewhere in this registration statement our future operating results are uncertain and likely to fluctuate       until the fourth quarter of  we had a history of operating losses although we were profitable for the years  and the first quarter of   was impacted by a charge of  million for purchase of inprocess research and development related to the atrix acquisition  see note  to the financial statements in our form k dated march   future operating performance and profitability are not certain our accumulated deficit at march   was approximately  million       our operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons in budgeting our operating expenses some of which are fixed in the short term we assume that revenues will continue to grow even a relatively small revenue shortfall or a small increase in operating expenses may cause a periods results to be below expectations a revenue shortfall or increase in operating expenses could arise from any number of factors such as     lower than expected revenues from sales of visudyne® eligard® or our other products       changes in pricing strategies or reimbursement levels for visudyne eligard or our other products       seasonal fluctuations particularly in the third quarter due to decreased demand for visudyne in the summer months       high levels of marketing expenses for visudyne such as may occur upon the launch of visudyne in a new market       fluctuations in currency exchange rates       unfavorable outcome of pending patentrelated litigation against the company       higher than expected operating expenses as a result of increased costs associated with the development or commercialization of visudyne eligard and our other products and candidates including increased costs associated with the further development and marketing of aczone tm  and       increased operating expenses as a result of product technology or other acquisitions or business combinations future sales of visudyne® eligard® and our other products may be less than expected       our prospects are dependent on the sales of our primary commercial product visudyne and to a lesser extent those of eligard and our other products our revenues to date have consisted largely of revenue from product sales of visudyne if sales of visudyne eligard or our other products decline or fail to increase it would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations       a number of factors may affect the rate and breadth of market acceptance and continued use of our commercial products including     perceptions of physicians and patients regarding the safety and efficacy of our products       patient and physician demand       the results of product development efforts for new indications or additional market opportunities for visudyne eligard and our other products       availability of sufficient commercial quantities of visudyne eligard and our other products       price changes for our products and the price of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments       retreatment rates for visudyne throughout the treatment process varying from the retreatment rates during clinical development  table of contents     the scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and favorable reimbursement programs for visudyne eligard and our other products       adverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning visudyne eligard or our other products       a decline in the market for visudyne or incidence rates of wet amd such as might occur if preventative treatments currently in development are successful       a decline in the markets for eligard or our other products or       a decline in reimbursement levels for our products as well as the other factors which are described in this section we may not be successful in addressing competition for visudyne® eligard® or our other products       we may be unable to contend successfully with current or future competitors the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition our competitors include major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies many of which have access to financial technical and marketing resources significantly greater than ours and substantially greater experience in developing and manufacturing products conducting preclinical and clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approvals       we are aware of a number of competitors or potential competitors to visudyne       eyetech pharmaceuticals inc in partnership with pfizer inc commercially launched its product macugen® in january of  macugen has been approved by the fda for the treatment of all forms of wet amd macugen now competes with visudyne in june of  eyetech pharmaceuticals announced its forecast of net product revenues from the sale of macugen for  of  million the impact of sales of macugen on sales of visudyne is not presently estimable but may be material       in may of  alcon inc announced that it received an approvable letter from the fda in response to its submission of an nda for its product retaane® for the treatment of wet amd alcon has also submitted european marketing authorization applications for this product alcon has recently announced that it will be meeting with the fda to discuss the approvable letter and the steps which may be necessary to gain final approval it is possible that final approval could be obtained in time to allow retaane to be competing with visudyne as early as during        genentech inc in collaboration with novartis pharma ag is currently conducting two phase iii studies of its product lucentis for the treatment of amd as well as a phase i ii trial studying lucentis in combination with visudyne therapy in may of  genentech announced preliminary data from its marina phase iii study evaluating lucentis in the treatment of wet amd genentech has announced that this study met its primary endpoint at one year with vision maintained or improved in roughly  of patients compared to  in the control arm in late may of  genentech announced preliminary data from its phase i ii study of lucentis and visudyne in combination which showed that  of patients maintained or improved vision in combination therapy compared to  using visudyne alone data from the other phase iii trial is expected in the fourth quarter of  it is possible that genentech could receive fda approval for lucentis for the treatment of amd in time to allow the product to be commercially launched and competing with visudyne as early during        we are aware of a number of other competitors developing treatments for amd including iridex corporation genaera corporation and genvec inc some of these treatments are in latestage clinical development we also believe that visudyne could be competing against surgical or other treatments for amd including macular translocation submacular surgery and laser photocoagulation among others if competing treatments for amd are introduced to the market visudynes market share could be eroded or retreatment rates reduced the terms of our agreement with novartis pharma ag or novartis do not restrict novartis from developing or commercializing whether by itself or in collaboration with third parties nonpdt products that could be competitive with our products that utilize pdt for ophthalmological indications including visudyne       there are a number of approved products on the market with which our eligard products compete these include astrazenecas zoladex® product bayer pharmaceuticals corporations viadur® product watson pharmaceuticals incs trelstar® product and tap pharmaceuticals incs lupron® product  table of contents       upon commercialization our aczone tm product will directly compete against several other prescription topical products for the treatment of acne these include but are not limited to erythromycinbenzoyl peroxide clindamycinbenzoyl peroxide tretinoin and adapalene products aczone tm will also compete indirectly with systemic prescription products and topical overthecounter therapies       competitors of our dental products include orapharma inc whose arestin tm product is used for the treatment of periodontal disease       we believe that certain competitors are conducting preclinical studies and clinical testing on their own or with certain third parties in various countries for a variety of diseases and medical conditions for which we have ongoing development programs these companies may also be involved in competitive activities of which we are not aware       each of our approved products faces competition and our products under regulatory review and in development will also face competition our industry is characterized by intense competition and new product innovation which may limit our commercial opportunities render our products obsolete or reduce our revenue       the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive we face intense competition from academic institutions government agencies research institutions and other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including other drug delivery companies some of these competitors are also our collaborators our competitors are working to develop and market other drug delivery systems vaccines antibody therapies and other methods of preventing or reducing disease and new smallmolecule and other classes of drugs that can be used without a drug delivery system       we are aware of other products manufactured or under development by competitors that are used for the prevention and treatment of certain diseases that we have targeted for product development the existence of these products or other products or treatments of which we are not aware or products or treatments that may be developed in the future may adversely affect the marketability of our products       many of our competitors have much greater capital resources manufacturing and marketing experience research and development resources and production facilities than we do many of them also have much more experience than we do in preclinical testing and clinical trials of new drugs and in obtaining fda and foreign approvals in addition they may succeed in obtaining patents that would make it difficult or impossible for us to compete with their products       because new product innovation can emerge unexpectedly in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries the development by competitors of technologically improved or different products may make our products or product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive the incidence of wet amd might be reduced if therapies currently in development or currently available prevent or reduce the risk of development of wet amd       we are aware of reports that a trial has been or is about to be initiated of a treatment for patients with the dry form of amd who are at high risk of developing wet amd with the objective of preventing the occurrence of wet amd we are also aware of published reports of studies showing that supplemental vitamin therapies reduce the risk of development of wet amd if these studies show that new therapies are effective or if supplemental vitamin usage becomes common place in patients with dry amd the incidence of wet amd which often develops in patients initially diagnosed with dry amd might be reduced and visudyne sales and the companys revenues could be materially reduced if we are unable to preserve the commercial relationships which were formed by atrix we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition       the former atrix established a number of commercial relationships with third parties that are individually or collectively important to the success of what is now qlt usa for example atrix formed strategic relationships with collaborators to help it commercialize and market its products such as its relationship with sanofiaventis for the united states and canadian commercialization and marketing of the eligard products if our relationship with those collaborators such as medigene ag or medigene sandoz inc or sandoz or sanofiaventis was impaired it could delay the applicable collaboration program or  table of contents result in expensive arbitration or litigation and qlt usas revenue may significantly decrease and our ability to develop and commercialize our technologies may be hindered we are dependent on third parties to market visudyne® and eligard®        a significant portion of our revenue depends on the efforts of novartis to market and sell visudyne if novartis does not dedicate sufficient resources to the promotion and sale of visudyne or if novartis fails in its marketing efforts or if marketing and distribution expenses are excessive the revenues we receive from the sale of visudyne would decrease and our business and operating results would be adversely affected the agreement between us and novartis pursuant to which novartis markets and sells visudyne has a term extending to  and may be terminated by novartis upon a default of the agreement by us or on  days notice       we have formed strategic relationships with a number of other collaborators to help us commercialize and market eligard our revenues from eligard and our dermatology and dental products are dependent on the efforts of our marketing partners in promoting and selling those products if those partners do not dedicate sufficient resources to the promotion and sale of our products the revenues we receive from sales of those products would decrease and our business and operating results would be adversely affected we are dependent on other third parties for the research development and commercialization of our products       our strategy for the development and commercialization of our products includes entering into various arrangements with third parties and therefore is dependent on the subsequent success of these third parties in performing their responsibilities under such arrangements       although we believe that parties to our collaborative arrangements have an economic incentive to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities generally are not under our control we cannot predict whether such parties will perform their obligations as expected or whether significant revenue will be derived or sustained from such arrangements to the extent such parties do not perform adequately under our various agreements with them the development and commercialization of our products may be delayed may become more costly to us or may be terminated and may require us to expend significant amounts of time and money to find new collaborators and structure alternative arrangements disputes with a collaborator could delay a program on which we are working with the collaborator and could result in expensive arbitration or litigation which may not be resolved in our favor in the field of photodynamic therapy or pdt we are dependent on the success and continued supply of thirdparty medical device companies with complementary light source and light delivery devices by third party suppliers       we currently depend on two thirdparty suppliers carl zeissmeditic and lumenis to provide the laser light delivery devices for visudyne therapy and to service such devices because pdt requires a light source and in some instances a light delivery system to be used in conjunction with our photosensitizers we are dependent on the success of these medical device companies in placing and maintaining light sources with the appropriate medical facilities in distributing the light delivery systems and servicing such systems as required carl zeissmeditic and lumenis supply such lasers to treating physicians directly and neither qlt nor novartis has a supply or distribution agreement with either carl zeissmeditic or lumenis for the supply of such devices the relationship between our company and novartis and such suppliers under which we and novartis provides support and assistance to such suppliers is an informal collaboration only if one or both of the medical device companies with whom we and novartis have such collaborations cease to carry on business or if as a result of industry consolidation financial downturn or for other reasons they no longer supply complementary light sources or light delivery systems or if they are unable to achieve the appropriate placements of light sources and ensure an uninterrupted supply and ongoing maintenance of light delivery systems to treating physicians sales of visudyne and our revenues from the sale of visudyne may be adversely affected we may not be able to secure additional or replacement arrangements with other satisfactory medical device companies to complement or replace the activities of our current providers       the expected lifecycle of the laser light delivery devices for visudyne therapy is approximately five to eight years therefore in the coming years we expect that many of these lasers will need significant upgrades  table of contents or will need to be replaced customers may decide not to invest in purchasing a new laser in light of emerging competitive therapies and this could negatively impact our future sales possibly materially we may be unable to have manufactured or continue to have manufactured efficiently commercial quantities of visudyne® or our other products in compliance with fda and other regulatory requirements or our product specifications       we depend on several third parties in the us canada europe and japan to manufacture visudyne and if such third parties fail to meet their respective contract commitments we may not be able to supply or continue to supply commercial quantities of the product or conduct certain future clinical testing we are dependent upon raylo chemicals inc nippon fine chemicals and parkedale pharmaceuticals inc to manufacture visudyne or components thereof the agreement between us and raylo chemicals is in effect for a term ending january   after which it will renew for a further two years unless one party provides the other with  months advance notice of its intention not to renew our agreement with nippon fine chemicals is in effect for a term ending on january   our agreement with parkedale pharmaceuticals inc is in effect for a term expiring december   although none of these agreements is terminable by the other party for convenience if we were to commit a default under or breach of any of such agreements the other party could terminate such agreement we may be unable to renew such agreements after their expiry on terms which are commercially acceptable to us       our ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize visudyne and our other products either directly or in conjunction with others depends in large part on our ability to have such products manufactured at a competitive cost and in accordance with fda and other regulatory requirements as well as our product specifications our contract manufacturers manufacturing and quality procedures may not achieve or maintain compliance with applicable fda and other regulatory standards or product specifications and even if they do we may be unable to produce or continue to produce commercial quantities of visudyne and our other products at an acceptable cost or margin       if current manufacturing processes are modified or the source or location of our product supply is changed voluntarily or involuntarily regulatory authorities will require us to demonstrate that the material produced from the modified or new process or facility is equivalent to the material used in the clinical trials or products previously approved any such modifications to the manufacturing process or supply may not achieve or maintain compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements or our product specifications in many cases prior approval by regulatory authorities may be required before any changes can be instituted       if our manufacturers produce one or more product batches which do not conform to fda or other regulatory requirements or our product specifications or if they introduce changes to their manufacturing processes our manufacturing expenses may increase materially our product inventories may be reduced to unacceptable levels andor our ability to meet demand for visudyne may be detrimentally impacted possibly materially for example during november  two visudyne batches did not pass quality inspection and product inventories and our results were negatively impacted by the associated accounting charge although not materially see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  note  in notes to the consolidated financial statements in our form k dated march   we have limited experience in manufacturing products on a commercial scale and if we are unable to produce enough eligard® or the other products which we manufacture to meet market demands this could cause a decrease in revenue       qlt usa completed the expansion of our manufacturing facility in the second quarter of  validation of the plant and equipment was completed during the third quarter of  certain areas of the plant were qualified by the fda in  we manufacture eligard at this facility even though we have obtained fda and other regulatory approval to do so our manufacturing processes are subject to further review by other regulatory authorities and continued review by the fda and other regulatory authorities if we modify our current manufacturing processes the fda and other regulatory authorities will require us to demonstrate that the material produced from the modified or new process or facility is equivalent to the material used in the clinical trials or products previously approved any such modifications to the manufacturing process or supply may not achieve or maintain compliance with the applicable regulatory  table of contents requirements or our product specifications in many cases prior approval by regulatory authorities may be required before any changes can be instituted       in addition later discovery of problems with our products or manufacturing processes could result in restrictions on such products or processes including potential withdrawal of eligard or other products from the market if regulatory authorities determine that we have violated regulations or if they restrict suspend or revoke our prior approvals they could prohibit us from manufacturing or selling eligard or other products until we comply or indefinitely in addition if regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of a product candidate then they may not approve the product candidate and we will not be able to market and sell it if we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected       there is also a risk that our manufacturing capabilities may not be sufficient to meet market demands for eligard or that we may experience a disruption in our manufacturing processes if we produce one more eligard product batches which do not conform to fda or other regulatory requirements or our product specifications our manufacturing expenses may increase materially our eligard product inventories may be reduced to unacceptable levels or we may be unable to meet demand for eligard if we are unable to meet demand for eligard for a significant period of time our business would be harmed materially we have a dependence on one contract manufacturer involved in the production of our eligard® products       we currently outsource the sterile filling and lyophilization also known as freeze drying process of our eligard products to chesapeake biological laboratories inc an approved contract manufacturer and rely on this manufacturer for this highly specialized service our contract with chesapeake biological laboratories is for a period of two years commencing january   and automatically renews for additional oneyear terms unless either party provides notice on nonrenewal more than  days prior to termination if this vendor was to deteriorate or terminate production of our eligard products may be temporarily discontinued for several months we currently have one other contract manufacturer as a backup source for the sterile filling and lyophilization process should there be a disruption in our eligard product supply chain however the fda would need to approve the change in the manufacturer of the sterile filling and lyophilization process for our eligard products which could take several months additionally we and our partners have at least three months of inventory safety stock of eligard products to meet near term future demands should a disruption in the sterile filling and lyophilization process occur to help address this risk we have built our own sterile filling and lyophilization facility which received fda approval to manufacture commercial product in december  the success of visudyne® eligard® and our other products may be limited by governmental and other thirdparty payers       the continuing efforts of governmental and thirdparty payers to contain or reduce the costs of health care may negatively affect the sale of visudyne eligard and our other products our ability to commercialize visudyne and our other products successfully will depend in part on the timeliness of and the extent to which adequate reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments is obtained from government health administration authorities private health insurers and other organizations in the us and foreign markets product sales attempts to gain market share or introductory pricing programs of our competitors could require us to lower our prices which could adversely affect our results of operations we may be unable to set or maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutic products or newly approved product indications       thirdparty payers are challenging the price and costeffectiveness of medical products and services and the adoption of new legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals could further limit reimbursement for medical products and services to the extent such governmental or private thirdparty payers introduce reimbursement changes which affect visudyne or our current or future product candidates sales of such products could be negatively affected for example the us congress recently introduced legislation that has changed the methodologies under which the medicare program reimburses for officeadministered therapies such as visudyne the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  reduced the rate of reimbursement for visudyne and certain other drugs by allowing  table of contents reimbursement based on  of the average wholesale price down from  we obtained an exemption from this rate adjustment for  only       there can be no assurance that any of our applications or reapplications for reimbursement for any of our products will result in approvals or that our current reimbursement approvals will not be reduced or reversed in whole or in part our product sales are worldwide and currency fluctuations may impair our reported financial results       our products are marketed worldwide for the three months ended march   approximately  of total visudyne sales were in the us with europe and other markets responsible for the remaining  we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar which is our reporting currency the canadian dollar is our functional currency and the us dollar is the functional currency of our subsidiary qlt usa we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a result currency fluctuations between the currencies in which we do business particularly the us dollar the euro the canadian dollar and the swiss franc have caused and could continue to cause significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates we engage from time to time in currency hedging techniques to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results and cash flows but we cannot be assured that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results or balance sheet from the full effects of exchange rate fluctuation we do not yet have a commercial infrastructure to market or sell pharmaceutical products and have limited experience directly selling products which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize aczone tm        qlt has not previously sold or marketed pharmaceutical products and does not currently have a sales force or any agreement with any provider of contract sales forces to market our products we now hold worldwide commercialization rights to aczone aczone was recently approved by the fda for the treatment of acne vulgaris the fda approved label for aczone requires that patients be prescreened for a specific enzyme deficiency patients who have this enzyme deficiency will need to be monitored with regular blood counts qlt has also agreed with the fda to undertake a postapproval phase iv study pertaining to this enzyme deficiency that label restriction and the results of the phase iv study if and when completed may limit the market potential for aczone we are presently considering our strategy as to how we wish to commercialize and further develop aczone if we decide to market aczone ourselves we will need to either hire a sales force or contract with a third party to provide a sales force to meet our needs if we decide to market aczone with or through a marketing partner we will need to reach an agreement with that partner with respect to the commercialization of aczone we may be unable to establish marketing sales and distribution capabilities or relationships necessary to commercialize and gain market acceptance for aczone any of the above occurrences could harm or prevent sales of aczone or could increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing this product our products in development may not achieve favorable results may fail to achieve regulatory approvals or market acceptance or may encounter difficulties with proprietary rights or manufacturing       our success depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval to market new pharmaceutical products development of a product requires substantial technical financial and human resources even if such product development is not successfully completed the outcome of the lengthy and complex process of new product development is inherently uncertain       our potential products may appear to be promising at various stages of development yet fail to reach the market for a number of reasons including     lack of sufficient treatment benefit or unacceptable safety issues during preclinical studies or clinical trials       lack of commercial market opportunity  table of contents     results from preclinical and early clinical studies not predictive of results obtained in largescale clinical trials       unfavorable data during a clinical trial causing us to determine that continuation of the trial is not warranted for example in may  we halted our two phase iii studies of tariquidar in nonsmall cell lung cancer after a review of safety and efficacy data by the independent data safety monitoring committee       the fda or other regulatory authorities suspending our clinical trials at any time if among other reasons it concludes that patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks       failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals after completion of clinical trials       existence of conflicting proprietary rights of third parties       inability to develop manufacturing methods that are efficient costeffective and capable of meeting stringent regulatory standards and       other business imperatives causing us to curtail a particular development program       we might fail to obtain the additional regulatory approvals we are seeking to expand our product line and the indications for which our products are approved those approvals may be delayed may not be obtained or may be more limited than anticipated we may lose market opportunities resulting from delays and uncertainties in the regulatory approval process if we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect the commercialization of our products may be delayed and as a result our business could be harmed       from time to time we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific clinical regulatory and other product development goals which we sometimes refer to as milestones these milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings from time to time we publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones all of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically compared to our estimates or they might not be achieved in some cases for reasons beyond our control if we do not meet these milestones as publicly announced the commercialization of our products may be delayed and as a result our business could be harmed factors which could cause us to fail to achieve milestones in accordance with our projections include     study results may vary from what had been predicted       studies may take longer to enroll or conclude than projected       unfavorable data during a clinical trial might cause us to determine that continuation of the trial is not warranted       the fda or other regulatory authorities might suspend our clinical trials at any time if for example it concludes that patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks       failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals after completion of clinical trials in a timely manner or at all and       other business imperatives might cause us to delay or discontinue certain development activities patient enrollment may not be adequate for our current trials or future clinical trials       our future prospects could suffer if we fail to develop and maintain sufficient levels of patient enrollment in our current or future clinical trials our willingness and ability to complete clinical trials is dependent on among other factors the rate of patient enrollment which is a function of many factors including     the nature of our clinical trial protocols or products       the inability to secure regulatory approval to modify previously approved clinical trial protocols       the existence of competing protocols       the size and longevity of the target patient population       the proximity of patients to clinical sites       the eligibility criteria for the trials and  table of contents     the patient dropout rates for the trials       delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs delays or termination of clinical trials which could materially harm our future prospects visudyne® eligard® or our other products may exhibit adverse side effects that prevent their widespread adoption or that necessitate withdrawal from the market       even after approval by the fda and other regulatory authorities visudyne eligard or our other products may later exhibit adverse side effects that prevent widespread use or necessitate withdrawal from the market undesirable side effects not previously observed during clinical trials could emerge in the future the manifestation of such side effects could cause our business to suffer in some cases regulatory authorities may require labeling changes that could add warnings or restrict usage based on adverse side effects seen after marketing a drug we may face future product liability claims that may result from the sale of visudyne® eligard® and our other products       the testing manufacture marketing and sale of human pharmaceutical products entail significant inherent risks of allegations of product liability our use of such products in clinical trials and our sale of visudyne eligard and our other product candidates may expose us to liability claims allegedly resulting from the use of these products these claims might be made directly by consumers healthcare providers or others selling our products we carry clinical trials and product liability insurance to cover certain claims that could arise during the clinical trials for our product candidates or during the commercial use of visudyne eligard or our other products such coverage and any coverage obtained in the future may be inadequate to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim and we may not be able to increase the amount of such insurance or even renew it a successful product liability claim could materially harm our business in addition substantial complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management we may be unable to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements       our commercial products and our products under development are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation for safety efficacy and quality by the us federal government principally the fda and by state and local governments to the extent visudyne eligard our other commercial products or products under development are marketed abroad they are also subject to export requirements and to regulation by foreign governments the regulatory clearance process is lengthy expensive and uncertain we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis or at all for any of our commercial products or any of our products under development and delays in receipt or failure to receive such clearances or approvals the loss of previously received clearances or approvals or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could materially harm our business       drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to the fdas approval are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda certain state agencies and various foreign governmental regulatory agencies such as the emea manufacturers are subject to inspection by the fda and those state agencies and they must comply with the host of regulatory requirements that usually apply to drugs marketed in the us including but not limited to the fdas labeling regulations good manufacturing practice requirements adverse event reporting and the fdas general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved or offlabel uses our failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us these sanctions could include warning letters fines product recalls or seizures injunctions refusals to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the us fda refusal to grant approval of drugs or to allow us to enter into governmental supply contracts withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecutions       we our contract manufacturers all of our subsuppliers as well as the suppliers of the medical lasers required for visudyne and other pdt therapy are subject to numerous federal state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions manufacturing practices environmental protection fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in addition advertising and promotional materials relating to medical devices and drugs are in certain instances subject to regulation by the federal trade commission or the fda we our contract manufacturers subsuppliers and laser suppliers may  table of contents be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future and such laws or regulations may materially harm our business unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements the failure of us our any of these manufacturers subsuppliers or suppliers to comply with such requirements or the adoption of new requirements could materially harm our business our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in identifying negotiating or integrating future acquisitions business combinations or strategic alliances       from time to time we may engage in negotiations to expand our operations and market presence by future product technology or other acquisitions and business combinations joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies we may not be successful in identifying initiating or completing such negotiations competition for attractive product acquisition or alliance targets can be intense and there can be no guarantee that we will succeed in completing such transactions on terms which are acceptable to us even if we are successful in these negotiations these transactions create risks such as the difficulties in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business the potential disruption to our ongoing business and the potential negative impact on our earnings we may not succeed in addressing these risks if we are not successful our business could suffer we are a defendant in pending intellectual property and patent lawsuits that may require us to pay substantial royalties or damages may subject us to other equitable relief or may otherwise seriously harm our business       we are a defendant in four lawsuits filed against us see item  legal proceedings in our form k dated march   and item  legal proceedings in our form q dated may   although we believe that the claims of the plaintiffs in these lawsuits are without merit these lawsuits may not ultimately be resolved in our favor if they are not resolved in our favor we may be obligated to pay damages may be obligated to pay an additional royalty or damages for access to the inventions covered by claims in issued us patents may be subject to such equitable relief as a court may determine which could include an injunction or may be subject to a remedy combining some or all of the foregoing we may not be able to obtain and enforce effective patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by competitors and patents of other companies could require us to stop using or pay to use required technology       we may not be able to obtain and enforce patents to maintain trade secret protection for our technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties the extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business       we have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for certain aspects of visudyne and our other products and technology such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide us with a preferred position with respect to any product or technology it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully in that event to the extent a preferred position is conferred by such patents any preferred position held by us would be lost if we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position visudyne and our other products could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products in addition we have an exclusive worldwide license from the university of british columbia or ubc see patents trademarks and proprietary rights in our form k dated march   for all of the patents and knowhow owned by ubc relating to verteporfin qlt and certain additional photosensitizers and their use as therapeutics or diagnostics under our license agreement with ubc if we fail to make any required payments to ubc ubc would have the right to terminate these licenses under our license agreement with massachusetts general hospital or mgh see patents trademarks and proprietary rights in our form k dated march   mgh would have the right to terminate the license if we defaulted under the agreement and failed to cure such default within  days       patents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of other parties the cost of enforcing our patent rights against infringers if such enforcement is required could be significant and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations       it is also possible that a court may find us to be infringing validly issued patents of third parties in that event in addition to the cost of defending the underlying suit for infringement we may have to pay license fees  table of contents andor damages and may be enjoined from conducting certain activities obtaining licenses under thirdparty patents can be costly and such licenses may not be available at all under such circumstances we may need to materially alter our products or processes       unpatented trade secrets improvements confidential knowhow and continuing technological innovation are important to our scientific and commercial success although we attempt to and will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners collaborators employees and consultants and other appropriate means these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and in any event others may develop independently or obtain access to the same or similar information we may need additional capital in the future and our prospects for obtaining it are uncertain       our business may not generate the cash necessary to fund our operations and anticipated growth we expect that the funding requirements for our operating activities will continue to increase substantially in the future primarily due to the expanded clinical testing of our other products the amount required to fund additional operating expenses will also depend on other factors including the status of competitive products the success of our research and development programs the extent and success of any collaborative research arrangements and the results of product technology or other acquisitions or business combinations we could seek additional funds in the future from a combination of sources including product licensing joint development and other financing arrangements in addition we may issue debt or equity securities if we determine that additional cash resources could be obtained under favorable conditions or if future development funding requirements cannot be satisfied with available cash resources additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all if adequate capital is unavailable we may not be able to engage in desirable acquisition or inlicensing opportunities and may have to reduce substantially or eliminate expenditures for research development clinical testing manufacturing and marketing for visudyne and our other products in march  qlt announced the establishment of a share buyback program having certain parameters as of july   qlt has purchased approximately  million of our common shares under the share buyback program on the open market the price paid by qlt for the repurchase of its shares varied according to the market price at the time of purchase we are subject to environmental compliance risks       our research development and manufacturing areas involve the controlled use of hazardous chemicals primarily flammable solvents corrosives and toxins the biologic materials include microbiological cultures animal tissue and serum samples some experimental and clinical materials include human source tissue or fluid samples we are subject to federal stateprovincial and local government regulation in the conduct of business including regulations on employee safety and handling and disposal of hazardous and radioactive materials any new regulation or change to an existing regulation could require it to implement costly capital or operating improvements for which we have not budgeted if we do not comply with these regulations we may be subject to fines and other liabilities various provisions of our charter and our shareholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding a change in control making removal of the present management more difficult or resulting in restrictions on the payment of dividends and other distributions to the shareholders       with shareholder approval we have adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be in effect for six years commencing march   the general effect of the plan is to require anyone who seeks to acquire  or more of our outstanding common shares to make a bid complying with specific provisions included in the plan in certain circumstances holders of common shares may acquire additional shares of qlt or those of the acquirer at a  discount from the thenprevailing market price the provisions of the plan could prevent or delay the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer a proxy contest or otherwise making it more difficult for shareholders to receive any premium over the current market price that might be offered       our authorized preference share capital is available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without shareholder approval our charter grants the
