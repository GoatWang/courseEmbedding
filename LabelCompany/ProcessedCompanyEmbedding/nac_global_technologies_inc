about us investors relations   technologies   harmonic gearing technology hgt nac drive systems inc a wholly owned subsidiary provides harmonic gearing and controls for robotics defense communications medical and a wide array of industrial applications harmonics are critical drives to many industries including robotics semiconductor aerospace and defense additionally harmonic technology is widely used in motion control applications where precision longlife compactness and reliability are important features we operate in both the commercial and defense industry segments within the commercial segment we currently sell to the following industries among others robotic printing corrugated semiconductor and health care harmonic gearing technology hgt is very unique and in its most basic form includes a flexible gear elliptical ball bearing and rigid outer spline this design offers several unique advantageous properties that have made hgt nearly irreplaceable in many applications hgt advantages include light weight high mechanical advantage precise smooth motion compact size high efficiency high reliability for critical applications consistent performance over time speed and load profiles and suitability for commercial military and space flight applications the company believes that there are very high barriers to entry in the market including proprietary designs and engineering company history product validation customer access metallurgical processing work holding and tooling vendor access and manufacturing know how quality and testing know how  nac drive systems partners with ctkm beijing harmonic drive ltd the national supplier of harmonic technology for the china space program new initiatives nac global technologies has strategic initiatives to develop and expand our application scope into emerging clean energy and advanced force sensing robotic applications positioning technology nac’s core hgt technology is ideally suited to a wide array of positioning applications including emerging applications in solar collector power generation  hgt’s zero backlash high efficiency attributes make it ideal for precise positioning at a distance and low power consumption thereby increasing the overall net power generated  the company has an active initiative based upon industry requests to develop high speed high volume automated production lines high volume applications nac’s decades of experience in the design and manufacturing hgt based assemblies positions the company well to meet industry needs and be a valuable partner to solar power companies   green energy today no known companies are focused on developing and commercializing the unique properties of hgt for the wind power industry the current fixed speed gearbox technology is plagued by reliability issues high costs and heavy weights it is a driving factor to move towards pmg’s permanent magnet generators in a typical mw turbine the traditional planetary gearbox might cost  usd and weigh over  kg typically three  stages are necessary to increase the speed and thus they have many moving parts the inertial is high so the cut in torque is also proportionately high the current designs utilize standard involute tooth forms which generate heat and wear with every revolution thus releasing metal particles into the lubricants frequent lubricant maintenance is necessary increasing environmental concerns and gearbox replacement is often required in as little as  years the current variable speed technology eliminates the gearbox and drives but that method results in a reliance on rareearth materials and greatly increases the diameter and weight of the generator the planned harmonic gear technology is a single stage high ratio high efficiency speedncreaser that resolves the gearing issue of the wind power industry   the potential impact is enormous on the field of wind power generation the use of harmonic gearing can eliminate one primary reason the industry is pushing towards direct drive generators with permanent magnets that being failures and maintenance costs of traditional gearboxes the expected cost size and reliability of the harmonic gearbox can eliminate the need to move to direct drives the unique harmonic gearing solution will significantly reduce drive train cost especially when coupled with an ac based variablespeed generator as planned the harmonic gearing solution will reduce weight and size as the technology will allow for ratios over  in a single stage only one stage is required and moving parts are dramatically reduced harmonic gearing is highly efficient and generates very little heat therefore lubrication systems maintenance and costs may be reduced the advanced harmonic gearing technology integrated with new and advanced variable speed ac based generator technology can provide superior performance in the areas of initial equipment cost installation costs maintenance costs reliability kwh with zero rareearth permanent magnet content similar in basic design and smaller in scale the company has design concepts or a variety of energy generation and capturing devices utilizing its core hgt technology   sensory feedback robotics prosthetics the company is seeking to further expand into the health care market with specialized drives for medicalsurgical robots and prosthetic limbs we believe many of the characteristics offered by nac’s core drive technology may offer benefit in these applications nac’s flow joint is a joint that allows senses for prosthetics a flow joint is a joint that allows senses and energy to flow bidirectionally through the joint this development may lead toward sensory feedback and a more realistic function we believe they can be developed to allow for a more natural use while saving power consumption and perhaps even for generating power to recharge the batteries nac is positioned well for this initiative as its drive technology is already bidirectional and allows power and energy to transfer though it in both directions and existing core competency includes precise force sensing technology and product lines of semiconductor strain wave force transducers in our current industrial control systems force sensors are located in the machine for closed loop feedback to the drive in a flow joint the concept is to build sensors into the drive part of the flow joint concept is to break down basic articulation functions into simple linear and rotational reactionary forces and providing a means to measure and translate them into electrical signals all within the joint drive design both segments the drive and sensing are within the company’s existing core competencies challenges include miniaturization and manufacturing techniques amongst others thought control of prosthetics is not within our business scope however many of the other factors are nac drives in miniaturized form and specialized for the application may provide a path forward to advance the state of the art     nac global technologies   salisbury road  jacksonville fl   phone    fax   infonacglobaltechnologiescom  nac global technologies news harmonic gearing technology home technologies
