today she created classpass its a company where you book local fitness classes for a set amount per month like  a month or something there were some tough years in the beginning but then it started to soar and you recently made the tough decision to step away from the ceo role youre still involved very much so in an executive chairman position we want to talk about all that first lets go back youre a worldclass dancer right youve been dancing since you were little thats part of what inspired you to do this company payal kadakia i started dancing when i was  years old in my basement with my moms best friend and it was my way of getting to know my culture but it also became more than that for me it became this place where i felt like i could be anyone i felt really centered and i loved it dance became this thing i fought to keep in my life throughout my career through my college years because i just felt so alive and so confident when i did it and so i never wanted to lose it shontell you have both sides of your brain going — you also went to mit kadakia my parents immigrated here in the s education a good career were obviously north stars for them at the same time i wanted the discipline i wanted to make sure i entered the real world in the right way i loved math and science so that was the other side of me and my creative side was really in dance and choreography passion for dance kadakia is a worldclass dancer who runs a dance company separate from classpass payalkadakiacom shontell what kind of dance kadakia its indian folk and classical dance when i was in school — especially at mit — i even wanted to dance there so i went and started a dance company a dance troupe thats still on campus today for me when i felt like it didnt exist i created it and thats sort of very much the way i live and think about most things when its not there i know if im passionate enough ill go and create it myself when i left mit and i came here to new york i had my job at bain and the first thing i did when i got here was look for where i was going to go take bollywood dance classes during my bain days i would invite my entire company to my shows its just one of those things that i think made me payal and everyone associated me with it when i was i would say entering my third year of bain most people at that point decide what they are going to do after and either they stay at bain or they go to business school — its usually the trajectory i wanted to find a way to dance more and to build something that was something more relevant and in the indian dance space i took a great job at warner music group i got to see the entire music industry transform and got to meet amazing people like daniel ek at spotify i was sort of doing that on the day job and every night for four hours i would dance with a group of girls that also were professionals and amazing at their jobs we would travel on the weekends and go and perform i always remember we ended up on the cover of the art section of the new york times this was two years into my warner experience maybe six months into when i started the company i didnt even have a website and i remember my boss was like are you going to come into work tomorrow i dont know i think i saw you on the cover of the art section of the new york times i love moments like that it makes you realize that you could do so much and accomplish so much if youre focused and passionate about what you do turning a hobby into a career kadakia performs with her dance troupe sa during a dreamforce keynote classpass shontell when we first met you had joined something called tech stars your startup was called classtivity at the time it was a variation of what classpass is now was that the first company you had — i guess you started the dance company but that was your first experience with tech kadakia yeah outside of building some small models and algorithmic programs at mit i really hadnt built something of that scale and the reason i did it was i was one day sitting at my desk i was looking for a ballet class to take and i was online and hours had passed by and i didnt choose what i would do and at that moment i was like why is this so difficult why is there not a website like opentable or seamless web or zocdoc that was just aggregating all this information and that made sense — i think it made sense to a lot of people because i raised a million dollars on that concept so then when we launched it and no one went to class that was really hard for me because that was my mission my mission wasnt to build just a tech website that looked nice and had all the information — it was to get people to go to class and pursue their passion and fall back in love with a hobby like i had with dance i realized we werent creating that impact and so when i came to terms with that i decided that we should pivot shontell so before we get to the pivot though lets talk about you leave warner you join tech stars how do you get into tech stars tech stars is this accelerator program where startups would apply and it was really rigorous it was hard to get into david tisch who was a big venture capitalist in the new york area was running it how did you wind up there doing this kadakia i had this idea brewing in my head and the vice chairman of warner music group michael fleisher called me he was like why dont you come to my office id love to hear about this id maybe met him three times in my three years there i ended up spending two hours explaining to him what i wanted to build and he was like you know what i love this he became my investor and he also was one of the mentors in the tech stars program he emailed david tisch that day and to me it was about relationships i know i did the application and all of it i really truly believe though i got in because people referred me and i always tell entrepreneurs this yes its about your application — theyre going to get thousands — but find a way to really get a good reference right or get someone to support you into the program i know i had a lot of people who were vouching for me being like i believe in payal i believe in this idea and i really believe its because of that shontell this company that youre building in tech stars classtivity its an opentable for classes you could go on and you could see ok i want to take a pilates class here are the places and the times kadakia it was be active and be creative it had fitness stuff on there it also had creative stuff on there like cooking classes and photography basically you could go on you could search by genre then you could pick the time and then you could pick the location and then we would show you the schedule even though this was a different product it actually helped us during that time build all the integrations into getting all the schedule data it wasnt easy to do that — i mean theres so many classes happening all day long and we were trying to pull in the feed of information to say heres all the uptodate information on whats available at every given time even though it was a phase at the company where the product didnt work it actually did help us build a lot of the scheduling integration that we need to on the back end raising money for a startup classpass shontell so tech stars has this demo day youre presenting to a room full of investors and journalists and things i was in the audience listening to you present kadakia it was so long ago shontell what happened after that does the money come easily was it a bit of a slog i know you had two different cofounders i think at the time kadakia when you have the hype of something like tech stars it definitely gives you some clout but at the end of the day we didnt have the numbers at the time it was a moment for me to go back to my mission and i decided we would let go of certain people we would focus the company on pivoting and iterating which was a hard decision to do but what was the point of keeping a product up and funding that when its not working shontell because people werent booking classes or there were no users or what was the problem kadakia they were coming and looking at the schedule data but they werent actually purchasing the classes so they werent actually going to class and we kept changing the buttons i think the day i knew we sent out an email saying go to class for free and still no one went i think the most transformative companies are ones that actually change human behavior and so while i had made it easy to go in search i hadnt motivated anyone to go to class shontell ok so you decide you need to make this change but you raised a little bit of money after tech stars and then i think — according to crunchbase at least — two years later you raised your next round kadakia during that first year and a half we raised roughly around  millionplus after tech stars i mean we were good about our burn right so i had enough cash in the bank that was one of my important points to even my team like wait why are we switching its like we have money right now the worst thing you could do is wait for it to run out with the wrong product we actually had enough stamina and enough funding to go through the next year but it was more of are we going to make the hard decisions to get and build the product that was going to get us to the next round of funding why joining a startup accelerator was a huge help — and the secret to getting accepted into one sarah jacobs shontell you guys start building this other product and you run a promotion right and something changes kadakia what we ended up doing is ok lets go talk to these studio owners and figure out what they wanted and what we realized is a lot of them were offering the first class for free so what we did was we packaged up the first classes for free and built a product called the passport which was a onemonth offering where people could go and try all these first classes for free as a new customer the bet we were making is ok people are going to do this and then go back and buy a package at these studios so we were collecting ratings and reviews on every single rating and class that you went to my internal benchmark was  of people who gave something a positive rating would go back and we werent seeing that we were seeing like  to  of people go back which to me was while it was great revenue for us and people were finally going to class and it was beautiful profit it wasnt a good business model i didnt want to build a onemonth experience for my customers — i wanted to build a lifestyle where you stayed active and passionate and for the business owners i was actually not sending them any money so when i fastforwarded that in terms of the business in terms of the product we had to make another hard decision of saying this is wrong when we actually looked at the data we saw that so many customers were actually buying the membership over and over again with different email addresses which gave us some sort of sense of maybe this is a monthly subscription we also did a survey and  of them said they wanted to do this experience over and over again shontell that was visiting different studios around you kadakia the variety was a part of the magic we almost stumbled upon that how important that was and it wasnt just a onemonth discovery thing — it was a part of peoples way of life you know we had a meeting and we were like ok theres something here and we decided to iterate and build this subscription model as well we still have this search engine up the passport and the classpass model up at this time and you know the team we all were sitting there and we were kind of like ok what do we do we started getting such positive feedback on this subscription people were now emailing me with things that were about their life changing because of this product and they felt confident it wasnt even about like i went and worked out you know it was something bigger i think as an entrepreneur and a founder who had been doing this for three and a half years and i did it because of my passion for dance i felt like i had given them dance what dance was to me in that moment i just knew we kind of had hit that magic and that lightning that was going to be revolutionary for that industry shontell you all took this product out to studios without it even really formed you said were going to start doing this thing — its going to be  a month for unlimited classes kadakia  was  classes shontell for  classes and you could do barre classes you could do pilates classes before i think maybe the assumption was youre going to join a gym or youre going to be into yoga or youre going to be into barre kadakia commitment to one studio shontell right but not combining — like cherrypicking what you wanted to do based on how you felt and how you wanted to work out that day kadakia and to be honest technologically it was hard to do it because how are you going to look at all the information and then also it just wasnt a concept anyone had really done if you wanted to be a dabbler you would probably have a gym membership because it was too expensive to do that actually doing it for the studios pivoting to classpass classpass shontell talk about how you get the pivot off and running how you talked to investors about it how do you talk to your team about it how do you plant the flag and say ok guys classtivity was cool but now were going to be classpass and were going to do this whole new thing kadakia we had actually put classpass up before we changed our name basically what happened is we decided that we would try this other iteration which would be the membership which we launched in june  three months in we started seeing this exponential growth of classpass it was completely viral we went from  users to like  you know what i mean in a matter of three months thats exponential growth shontell you mean  kadakia no im talking about like hundreds im talking about like really small numbers shontell oh wow so actually  kadakia thirtyfive people in our first month i always say that to people because people want these bigger numbers but were building a subscription and a lifestyle and you need to figure out what your numbers are going to be for us when we got to a thousand members we were at a milliondollar run rate so to me that was what i was trying to get to right when you have a  subscription thats what youre aiming for what was so great is we saw the growth of classpass surpass the passport and classtivity as a search engine and so what we ended up doing is in february of the following year changing our name to classpass rebranding we shut down the search engine we took out the passport and i actually remember one of my advisers andrew weinrich he always would say to me just get rid of the passport — he could see this we kind of were like well its what gave us the variety and maybe people want the passport and then well do classpass and he was like its like crack to you guys itll be a chapter in your book i didnt fully understand at that moment what that meant and now i totally understand what he meant sometimes you just have to be able to know that its the wrong product and move on what was so great is we saw the growth of classpass surpass the passport and classtivity as a search engine and so what we ended up doing is in february of the following year changing our name to classpass rebranding we shut down the search engine we took out the passport and i actually remember one of my advisers andrew weinrich he always would say to me just get rid of the passport — he could see this we kind of were like well its what gave us the variety and maybe people want the passport and then well do classpass and he was like its like crack to you guys itll be a chapter in your book i didnt fully understand at that moment what that meant and now i totally understand what he meant sometimes you just have to be able to know that its the wrong product and move on shontell what was the initial thing you offered to users as this new company kadakia with classpass it was  for  classes we had about  studios in new york city probably signed up at the time shontell  was a steal when you considered that a spin class around here in new york city costs about what  a session at least kadakia yeah i mean in the beginning we werent working with a lot of the toptier studios these were a lot of like i would say studios that had a lot of excess capacity — werent really big names we got the big names as the product kept growing which was also part of the fun war stories that we have we didnt in the beginning have contracts with all the studios but we realized that the brand names mattered so we were fulfilling a lot of these reservations manually without any integrations just to see — we needed to figure out what the customer wanted thats the ultimate thing thats what you need to do you need to keep figuring out what the customer really wants and we didnt know serving  sets of customers sarah jacobs shontell you had the tricky job of having two sets of customers you had studios that you have to make happy that youre partnering with that youre paying checks to every month based on referrals and you have people like me who use classpass and are signing up for classes and want the best prices this a problem that uber has the same thing with keeping drivers happy keeping customers happy its very hard to balance the two how did you figure that out and did you ever make mistakes with it kadakia one of the things that was really important to me — its actually something i studied at mit — which was management of inventory and capacity utilization we never wanted to cannibalize we were trying to do is figure out where they had excess capacity and that was something we built into the system from the beginning of saying were going to make available the spots that youre not selling so this is incremental revenue that was a really important part of our value proposition from the beginning and we also restricted how many times you could go to anyones studio for that purpose as well it was a matter of protecting — if you want to be a loyalist we were like please go sign up at the studio this product is not for that person shontell you couldnt do all  classes at the same studio kadakia you cant right that was part of the premise of getting you to say lets just get people who actually were scared to work out and we wanted to make it accessible for people to say yes so then obviously our partners would have more inventory utilized and the classes would be more energetic and full that was really the premise it was started under and maintained under obviously as we grew we had to keep figuring out what those inventory limits were and continue to build algorithms for our studio owners that kept optimizing their revenue and were still working on that whats amazing is how much data we have to be able to now predict if you change your schedule around you would get this much more money those are the things that we can do for our partners now because we have so much data historically on how much their  pm class on a wednesday sells out keeping investors interested fritz lanman an early investor in classpass with kadakia classpass shontell how hard was it the first few years and were investors actually interested in it did you find that it hard to pitch to them at first kadakia i think i had a lot of people who were like payal we love you but products not there or business is not there i never gave up though i think as a founder and entrepreneur you just keep hustling through it i knew id figure it out and as long as you dont run out of money which is the no  key thats like your right to keep going you have to keep making hard decisions like i remember i needed a bridge round and people were like of course because they were seeing — shontell — explain what a bridge round is kadakia i needed an extra  to stitch between where i was with my capital and where i wanted to go and i wasnt ready to go into a big round and so it was awesome because i think people were just like your progress i always say investors invest in lines not dots i was giving them so many dots that were so much better than the last time i had seen them and i was keeping people in the loop for me the reservation number and our revenue trajectory — i remember just sending charts and the hockey stick to people so many of my investors i remember when they were like when you texted me that it was like oh my god i remember sitting down with hayley from birchbox and i was like heres what it looks like she was just like show me that again i feel like that was when i knew we had cracked something that was really special that was january  shontell i had investors emailing me saying ive seen you write about payal before do you know her and can you intro me you had a serious demand that cooked up vcs are like oh whats the next shiny thing i have to get into this hot deal you were — you became that hot deal what was it like when you hit that inflection point do you notice a change how do you deal with that as a founder kadakia i did notice the change i remember going out to raise my series a and ending up with multiple term sheets when i had gone to silicon valley probably four times at that point and coming back with nothing this is when i met fritz and i was like fritz is the type of person i want involved in my company shontell fritz lanman is your now ceo kadakia hes the ceo of classpass it was one of those moments when i met fritz i knew he believed in my mission i was meeting all these people who i know were now chasing me because they saw traction but i didnt know if they believed in my mission its really hard to figure that out in three days when everyones like lets sign a term sheet tomorrow i had that struggle and i remember fritz and i chatted about it he was very much helping me with the fund raise i was like i just dont know if i trust any of these folks i dont know them and i want the chance to get to know them i had multiple data points with them the same way they have multiple data points on me — it didnt feel fair fritz was like i think i can get you the capital so he ended up leading my series a and getting more involved in the company and i said no to some really great people who actually got involved in the company in later rounds because i had enough data on them how classpass figured out how to price its product after a few stumbles that made users scream sarah jacobs shontell youve had to make some tough decisions throughout the course of the companys growth and history one of them is the pricing has changed that hasnt always been wellreceived by users theres been some screaming on twitter and things like that there was this  beautiful price point for a long time where — was it unlimited classes or am i making that up kadakia it was unlimited for a bit shontell for  you could get unlimited classes people were going to literally a class every day sometimes it was a huge discount like i said  could get you one spin class normally and then you changed prices sort of seemingly out of the blue how did you make that decision why did you make it and were there mistakes made kadakia it was  for  in the beginning and we were getting data and people were only going to five that was like the original number and it was this amazing thing where my cfo and i would always chat about this he was like people die for engagement we have too much engagement now it was this interesting thing where everything i had set out in the world to do from this moment i started this company was coming true from a product and consumer perspective but it was breaking the business right in the sense of we didnt know how much people would work out no one had ever done this before i had no blueprint the only way to actually test this was in a reallife test and so the first thing we did is we increased the price we didnt know where usage would settle and it wasnt the right price and then we actually realize as we were increasing price of unlimited i was shutting out a part of the market that i actually wanted in the market this product was meant for people to be accessible and we were making it less accessible over time so then we started launching the lower tiers and as we started launching the lower tiers the unlimited tiers deteriorated even more in terms of its profit shontell by lower tier you mean a cheaper amount for fewer classes kadakia exactly some people they were like i want to go to class but they were like i can do this for  but when unlimited started going we had to keep increasing the price on that — the value proposition was changing and the type of customer was changing thats when we saw the success of the lowertier products and we were like ok these are great people love them as much as they love the unlimited product and so we had to make the hard decision to sunset our unlimited plan but that being said we also made sure that — two things i would say we made sure that we grandfathered a lot of them into having  classes per month because we wanted them to keep trying it and we also introduced bundle so you could keep going to class and we made the ui as simple as possible and we just launched video on demand too that was a very important thing for me as a founder to be like were going to give you a way to work out every day because thats what our premise is we dont want to say to be fit you need to have lots of money that is not the premise we started the company under shontell you go through all this youve changed the price you figure it out youve iterated and how many markets are you in kadakia were in  cities globally shontell ok and how many users can you share any metrics kadakia were past  million reservations since we launched classpass so  how to combat a bunch of copycats that undercut you on price kadakia left takes a playful swing at her startups chicago launch event instagram shontell thats tremendous growth so much so that a slew of copycats came out kadakia yeah that was an interesting phase shontell theres all these people so how do you deal with that as a founder when youve got something successful thats working thats hot and then all these copycats come out and undercut your price or try to kadakia it was an interesting phase in the company i believe you win the race by looking forward not behind it became a little hard there was this phase where i feel like every day i would get to my desk and the team was talking about it and people were talking about it and so we were like alright this is ours to lose thats how i felt i think we kind of knew we had to kind of take on the market and expand rapidly and we did that we went to  cities in a matter of six months shontell wow kadakia yeah shontell are you guys making money kadakia were on track to be profitable shontell how do you balance that how do you balance how much to charge someone versus what it does to your bottom line and how do you decide when to toggle things kadakia i think weve now priced our product in a way that is sustainable for the company and its great value for our customers and at the same time were also innovating on the partner side to partner with them in terms of dynamic pricing weve always had this one payment one price for every class that weve paid the studios weve also started figuring out what are ways we can drive them more traffic with different prices so were also experimenting on that side of it but at the end of the day for us its really — weve now realized what the usage sort of looks like on the plans that are capped which are easier than having obviously an unlimited number of classes that you can go to shontell one other thing as you are growing a lot of people ask the question of groupon they say this has been done before where you get this great bargain to go into a new place groupon did it it was very successful for a while it went public and then all of a sudden it didnt work was that a fair comparison to make or did you guys take anything that groupon did and learn from it kadakia the member we were marketing to was somebody who was scared to walk into a fitness studio they didnt know the price of a class yes its good that a lot of people do but actually the market we were actually creating were people who had really never done this before we wanted to make sure that this was seamless easy we were dealing with the excess capacity not your primetime spots that were going to push out your loyal customers that was something that we thought about from the beginning and the other thing we thought about was the lifestyle of it how a ceo decides to stop being ceo classpass shontell recently you made the tough decision to not give up your baby — youre still very much involved in classpass — but you did step away from the ceo role how did you arrive at that decision kadakia i think founders as they go through their company the founderceo role just fundamentally changes one of the comparisons i always love to make is dance companies have an artistic director and an executive director and theyre not the same person im a very creative person and i think about my product from that place of creativity and wanting to improve peoples lives i went to mit i worked at bain but my magic is in my artist side and i kept feeling like i was pushing away from it and thats actually what built this company every single day i was getting further and further away you have to build a team to be able to go back to that and thats like one of my advisers always said your freedom to create lies in people i looked around and i was like who are the folks that i have around me and fritz and i have had such a great relationship and i trust him  he knows exactly what i want to build i dont know if i would make the decision if it was anyone else and so its been great and hes been such a great partner and i love what im doing now shontell its got to be still a hard emotional decision to make this is a role that youre stepping back from when youve had it for years youve grown this thing from the ground up the ceo title theres something that comes with that kadakia the impact we have on peoples lives to me is more important than any title anyone can carry and the one thing the only thing and i thought a lot about this was i want little girls to believe that they can be ceos the best thing i could do though is be an empowered female and authentically doing what i love thats the message i want to send not go and do things you dont like because thats what the world needs right to me i will be a stronger person if im moving forward doing the work i want and continue to drive force the purpose that i want to create versus doing what other people think i should be doing which is never a way to live shontell what youre saying too is that the role of ceo changes as your company changes its very different when youre starting out to when you have hundreds of people that youre managing what were some of the things that you found that you didnt like kadakia i felt like my day just became a lot of meetings and i wasnt finding time to actually brainstorm and build my product and think creatively about what we were building and take those chances on innovation and i knew i was the lifeline to that — if that made sense — and i wanted to free myself up to do it shontell what are you doing now day to day whats the role of executive chairman kadakia i think it varies for every executive chairman thats out there i think as founder for me its about focusing on the product and the member experience we just launched some really cool stuff now you can go back to studios like the small premium theres a video product that we just launched and that im continuously focused on and what were going to be doing in the digital era which is so unbelievable and growing right now just how — we were just talking about this — how digital and video is becoming such a prominent part in peoples lives i think theres a really great big fitness angle and a platform angle for classpass to have there shontell are you going to stick cameras in studios and let people stream it at home or what kind of videos kadakia were exploring a lot of things i think the no  thing i would say is our vision is to make that studio experience come to your home because its really important we know how great these studios are and not everyone can access them i think this is a part of who weve always been its great for the new yorker whos next to five barre studios and two spin places but what about someone whos in the middle of idaho they cant do it shontell as really a firsttime tech founder what were you surprised to learn and what was the hardest part kadakia some of the things that ive fallen in love with which i think i wasnt expecting were things like ux and design i actually think its such a new field that five years ago i dont think people were studying user experience right i think its so cool that we have to now think about whats going on in the screen every inch of it kind of matters so thats just been interesting for me as a founder to dive into i think being in new york and building a company here was a complete interesting learning lesson and to be honest to see the new york tech scene completely change and transform over these five years — i couldnt count the number of entrepreneurs i knew on my one hand five years ago now its unbelievable how many people there are and
