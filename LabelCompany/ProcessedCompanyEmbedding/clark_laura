guidoclarks house high in the berkeley hills on a workday her wheresthefire scarlet mini cooper with a white top sits at the curb  usually bumper to bumper with the screaming yellow jeep that belongs to her assistant ashley gillespie from there its a few steps down and across a serene courtyard patrolled by resident cats pablo and nellie to the garage which four years ago dan clark had converted into a studio so that his wife could patrol their two kids ellis and paris the walls are mostly white a martha stewart tone with a greenish tinge on the side abutting the courtyard the floors covered in gray flor house pet carpet squares in hamster but color pays the mortgage for guidoclark a petite woman who plays a gigantic role in the hues and textures of cars appliances carpets office furniture barbie merchandise and even toothbrushes yes its a highly neutral space she says of her bland work room we try to keep it as visually spare as we can so that when we see color we really see color latest sfgate videos the look of things runs deep for guidoclark who studied premed and interior design back in detroit at wayne state university and has a way of sounding the way a psychotherapist would in talking about color yes you love red your mother but how does it she make you feel she talks of naming a carpet pattern she loves you to convey a have fun with this message to buyers and creating  colors of spinneybeck leather just to show that well spinneybeck could you needed to appeal to peoples emotions even though they might go to the safest thing says the principal of guidoclark design they needed to know that all these colors were there even though they went for navy blue burgundy and black its the same thing with flor you put in a color because emotionally its so engaging even though a person might not be ready and they might pick the more neutral version of it but youll see it coming on the upswing once they get used to that then theyre ordering things with big flowers for the floor she never just says its a pretty color  says beverly thome guido clarks now retired former business partner she gives the client backup she gives them research she gives them the reasons why they need to do these things  which is what they need to know that she knows the reasons she knew for instance that the people who loved a red car would not want to see that red on a toothbrush and after many hours of research for toyota that the people who made cars would be wise to look at the way consumers were decorating their homes cars have become more like the home and we no longer will tolerate for  plastic and velour seats she says were so sophisticated about mixing materials and finishes in the home guidoclarks own home through the always open studio door mixes the modern and the classic the art and the antique the beautiful with the comfortable when they shopped nine years ago her husband had wanted the  house  it had been painted black then white in previous lives  and she didnt dan redesigned the floor plan though and consolidated the staircase to their three living levels now she says i love this house this is an appreciative house there are houses you fix and the more work you put into them the more they need this house isnt like that its very receptive to change its still a work in progress  the unrenovated top floor where the master and paris bedrooms are she shows sheepishly on the lower level the kitchendining room footprint felt solid so guidoclark merely did her skin thing pouring concrete counters taking off cabinet doors refinishing the walls in a soft yellow making a cool room warm the main floor offers picture windows full of expansive fourbridge views with two living spaces  one for watching television the other for reading and conversation on the walls photos by famed rock photographer jim marshall share space with squares of artificial turf and contemporary paintings on permanent loan from thome colors throughout are quiet even on the comfy chartreuse sofa in the tv area a range of soft green tones cover the walls with a warmer yellow base in the living room and a cooler blue base in the lightflooded family room fabrics are all natural in shades evoking tea chalk seaweed and hay its the living room that best showcases guidoclarks attention to detail accents include an old glove form from ivan home in berkeley on the knoll barcelona coffeetable and glittering dream letters by wendy addison hanging from the mantel flanked by a pair of whimsical sconces made of hand blown grappa bottles which guidoclark found in london but as good as the room looks the chairs and sofa are comfy the accessory pieces touchable i want to feel that this is my house and we can live here and i dont want my kids to feel this is a showcase she says that doesnt mean she doesnt agonize over every inch of material that covers it guidoclark has almost finished the bathroom near ellis greenblue bedroom on the main floor doing it up in soapstone and matte granite with a gigantic medicine cabinet to hold all clutter and a vintage crystal pendant fixture to offset the sharper finishes but shes tortured by one wall i am my own worst client she says i cant even tell you how long i spent looking for wallpaper for this wall i want something thats different and not easy to find  it isnt that i dont know what i like its just such a personal thing it takes longer too bad she cant treat herself like a real client thome says part of her brilliance is communicating and stretching clients further than they want to go without taking them too far at this moment for guidoclark that means leading clients to color weve had this pragmatic period but color is the story now she says i think it represents a sense of optimism
