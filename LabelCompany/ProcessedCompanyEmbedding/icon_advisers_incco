they anticipate thermo fisher scientifics stock price to reach  in the next twelve months view analyst ratings for thermo fisher scientific what are analysts saying about thermo fisher scientific stock here are some recent quotes from research analysts about thermo fisher scientific stock  according to zacks investment research over the last three months thermo fisher is trading above the broader medical  instruments industry the company’s last reported first quarter  was quite impressive the increased  guidance is all the more encouraging indicating the fact that this overall bullish trend will continue through  moreover we remain encouraged by the company’s series of product launches and acquisitions along with strong growth in emerging markets and better management observed in its customer value proposition thermo fisher’s acquisition of fei has already started to boost the company’s analytical instruments portfolio its recent decision to acquire pantheon is to expand its biopharma services in europe on the flip side competitive pressure and currency headwinds add woes   evercore isi analysts commented when all is said in done we will remember q as being generally uneventful with guidance coming in better than feared as investors had become concerned re the impact from slowing biopharma demand didnt really occur mixed ag trends and an incremental headwind from fx the level of consistency we see from tmo is unusual in this challenging healthcare environment and likely helps to justify valuation that is certainly not inexpensive on an ev  ebitda basis particularly in a rising rate world that being said with so few places to hide in a difficult healthcare tape we would expect tmos superior eps growth to help shares to remain a preferred equity particularly given its status as a visible compounder thus despite todays sharp move in shares up a bit more than we would have anticipated we reiterate our buy rating as risk  reward continues to be asymmetrically biased upward  who are some of thermo fisher scientifics key competitors some companies that are related to thermo fisher scientific include danaher corporation dhr boston scientific
