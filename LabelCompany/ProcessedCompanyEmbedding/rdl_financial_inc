commented we are downgrading tyson foods inc nyse tsn from buy to hold although the company posted strong fiscal q results we are concerned about an sec investigation of tyson and other poultry producers for alleged manipulation of a chicken pricing index we also see the potential for decelerating earnings in the coming quarters and are concerned about the recent bird flu outbreak at poultry farms in tennessee and alabama in addition we believe that the companys new ceo tom hayes is likely to be cautious about acquisitions and business expansion and believe that this is weighing on tsn
