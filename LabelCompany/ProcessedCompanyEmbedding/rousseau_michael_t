starks will step down in january chief operating officer michael rousseau to take over  by joe carlson star tribune september   — pm glen stubbe star tribune st jude medical corporate headquarters are in little canada text size comment share tweet email print more share on share on linkedin share on google share on pinterest copy shortlink purchase order reprint michael t rousseau has exercised a strong behindthescenes role shaping st jude medical inc into the rapidly growing health care devicemaker it is today which helps explain why he’s been tapped to become the ceo come january daniel starks who has been ceo for  years announced wednesday morning that he intends to step down as president and chief executive of the manufacturer of artificial heart valves pacemakers and devices to treat pain and heart failure starks  will remain with the company in a more advisory role as executive chairman of the board of the little canadabased company “the timing is good” starks said in an interview “if i thought we were in a position where the company was about to undertake any special struggles i would want to stay on board to help work through those struggles i think that to the contrary we are on a good growth track and we have multiple visible growth drivers that are just coming to bear” rousseau  began his career at st jude in  as a senior vice president over global marketing of the company’s traditional sales powerhouse heart rhythm devices ten years later he was named group president and assumed responsibility over the company’s four divisions cardiac rhythm management atrial fibrillation cardiovascular and neuromodulation last year he became st jude’s chief operating officer he was the architect of a strategy to centralize global functions of the company’s four divisions many of which were added through the  corporate acquisitions st jude has done under starks’ management st jude medical stock dropped  percent to close at  on wednesday analysts with leerink partners in boston wrote in a note to investors that drop in stock price seemed “overdone” and was likely in reaction to the realization that starks’ departure probably closes the door on a rumored potential takeover of the company by abbott laboratories st jude medical michael t rousseau was named president and chief executive officer of st jude medical wednesday and will take the post at the start of the new year an abbott spokesman has said it is not pursuing such a deal on wednesday starks said the aug  report in the financial times reporting the deal speculation was the first time he’d heard the talk “it was a bolt from the blue” starks said the note from leerink analyst danielle antalffy praised st jude medical’s orderly transition of the ceo a move that she said was not surprising given that the company seemed to be grooming rousseau for such a role in the past year “given that rousseau has been with the company for  years we believe little or nothing will change as it relates to the company’s longterm strategy of continuing to innovate — both via internal and external investments — in highgrowth medtech markets within cardiology and neuromodulation” antalffy said in the note “rousseau may even bring an increased focus on costsavings to the table — something on which he was very focused as coo” rousseau is known internally for his work revamping st jude medical’s internal planning which led company executives on july  to announce plans to buy california heartpump maker thoratec corp for  billion expected to close by the end of this year the deal will be st jude’s largest since the company’s founding in  lifescience alley the minnesota medtech trade group where st jude is a member congratulated rousseau on the announcement “we are excited to see the organization and its leadership team build on the legacy of growth and success led by dan starks over the past  years” lifescience alley ceo shaye mandle said in an email starks became a director at st jude in  and became chairman president and ceo in may  during his tenure as the chief executive the company grew from  billion in annual revenue in  to more than  billion in  — a period of time marked by significant changes in how health care is paid for and delivered in the united states and globally those changes include a slowdown in sales growth of heart rhythm devices like pacemakers and implantable defibrillators which have long been key products for st jude starks’ bio on the company site credits him with transforming the company from being primarily focused on heart valves and rhythm devices to “an industry leader with a broad product portfolio across diverse diseasemanagement areas” st jude is assembling what it says will be the industry’s most complete line of devices for heart failure starting with a minimally invasive monitor wireless heart monitor called cardiomems to thoratec’s implantable pumps which use a propeller device and an external battery to circulate a person’s blood when the heart can’t do the job on its own “over the past  years i have had the privilege of working alongside dan to change the company from being largely dependent on valves and crm devices to being an industry leader with a diverse disease state management portfolio” rousseau said in a statement “this is an exciting time for our industry and i am highly confident in our ability to continue to deliver technologies that transform patient care in markets around the world” starks continues to hold a large block of st jude medical’s stock —  million shares under direct ownership as of july  securities filings say he built up that ownership position after st jude acquired cardiovascular device maker daig corp where starks had been president and a director until the  deal brought him to st jude   twitter joecarlson joecarlsonstartribunecom  joecarlson view comments read our comment standards startribunecom

schedule detailing reported and comparable constant currency sales results by business area this press release is available on the st jude medical website for participants on todays call please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted are on a comparable constant currency basis which includes thoratec sales in both comparable years and are adjusted for the impact of currency sales for the quarter totaled  billion up  from the second quarter of last year unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased this quarters sales by approximately  million during the second quarter we recognized  million or  per share in net after tax special charges acquisitionrelated costs and amortization expense for further information regarding these items please refer to details provided in our press release comments during this call referencing second quarter results will be exclusive of these items adjusted earnings per share were  for the second quarter of  compared to adjusted eps of  in the second quarter of  we estimate that on a constant currency basis second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased  before we discuss our second quarter  sales results by product category let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates as discussed on prior calls the two most significant currencies influencing st jude medicals operations are the euro and the yen in preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter  we used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about  to  and for the yen each ¥ to ¥ would translate into  for the second quarter the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen were consistent with these ranges i will now walk through second quarter results in our new product categories heart failure atrial fibrillation neuromodulation cardiovascular and traditional cardiac rhythm management for the second quarter total heart failure sales were  million down  from last years second quarter sales results reflect strong global growth in lvad sales offset by the impact of us crm sales weakness in our crt product segment atrial fibrillation or af product sales for the second quarter totaled  million up  our worldwide af business again demonstrated strong growth with the continued adoption of our ablation catheter portfolio and our initial launch of ensite precision in european markets total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of  were  million up approximately  as we continue to take share on a global basis with the most comprehensive neuromodulation portfolio in the market total traditional crm sales for the second quarter of  were  million down  sales results were largely driven by weakness in the us which declined primarily due to mri product gaps in both our low voltage and icd product segments total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of  were  million up  turning to the income statement the gross profit margin during the second quarter was  down  basis points from the second quarter of  primarily due to a decline of  basis points related to the negative impact of currency additionally there was a  basis point decline related to the continued weakness in our highermargin us crm business these negative factors were partially offset by the yearoveryear benefit of the repeal of the medical device excise tax which improved our gross profit margin in the quarter by  basis points our second quarter sga expenses were  of net sales a  basis point improvement from the second quarter of  research and development expenses in the second quarter were  of net sales other expense was  million in the second quarter primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt and our effective income tax rate for the second quarter was  i will now turn it back to mike michael t rousseau  president chief executive officer  director thank you don i appreciate everyone joining us this morning as you heard second quarter results were in line with previously issued guidance our momentum continues to build across our business with numerous product approvals and launches in international markets where we generally have more products available for sale we grew  on a comparable constant currency basis the strong performance of our international business gives us confidence that where we have a full portfolio of emerging technologies including mrisafe devices heartmate  ensite precision and our proprietary burst technology we can deliver the top tier of growth that we expect as an organization we remain focused on our strategic plan of surrounding disease states and delivering the results we committed to earlier this year our results this quarter particularly in our international business continue to give us confidence that our strategy will bring us back to top tier growth starting with our heart failure portfolio through our strategic acquisitions and organic growth we have created the broadest and most innovative heart failure medical device portfolio in the world our investment in this space illustrates our commitment to work with governments hospitals and physicians on solutions for this global expensive epidemic disease in the second quarter we launched multipoint pacing or mpp in the us and are executing on our contracting strategy for this breakthrough treatment option for crt patients who are not responsive to other pacing options the clinical evidence for mpp is growing with data showing more improved acute and chronic hemodynamic response which includes increased injection fraction rates and improved reverse modeling we also have evidence demonstrating improved clinical heart failure response rates mpp adoption increased throughout the quarter and initial feedback in the us has been positive with electrophysiologist understanding the need for this technology to help reduce nonresponder rates nonresponder rates account for about onethird of the total population of patients receiving crt therapy we are also excited about recent and upcoming launches in the us europe and japan for our syncav crt software algorithm which automatically adjusts pacing based on realtime changes in a patients cardiac condition this technology provides yet another option for patients who are not responsive to traditional pacing solutions and also helps physicians further improve treatment of patients who have responded positively to traditional crt we view this expanded portfolio as establishing a new standard of care in crt our cardiomems heart failure system is the cornerstone of our heart failure portfolio and we are committed to ensuring there is established reimbursement and clear guidelines for this important technology recently the european society of cardiology included cardiomems in its issued guidelines as directed therapy management and as a monitoring tool for heart failure patients we view this recognition of the clinical importance of cardiomems by a leading medical society as a sign of the growing support for this technology as previously mentioned we have also filed for a national coverage determination with cms and are awaiting formal acceptance of our submission from the agency in the lvad space we have completed the integration of thoratec and are pleased with the results and strong adoption of heartmate  by the clinical community since the launch of heartmate  last october feedback from customers continues to reflect the positive clinical outcomes experienced in the ce mark trial we continue to capture share in international markets and are pleased with the approximately  comparable constant currency growth of our international lvad business in addition to our strong results the clinical evidence surrounding heartmate  continues to grow the international society for heart and lung transplant international society for heart and lung transplantation held its annual meeting in april featuring very positive data on both heartmate  and  including the heartmate  ce mark month data and real world experience in the kazakhstan study the road map study also showed that  of patients at two years improved at least one new york heart association class compared to only  in the optimal medical management group additionally day mortality within the lvad group was only  which is equivalent to optimal medical management looking ahead we expect to present the heartmate  us ide shortterm data before the end of this year moving to our global af business it grew by  driven by continued success of our ablation catheter business and a limited european launch of our new ensite precision cardiac mapping system our comprehensive af product portfolio is a key differentiator for st jude medical it demonstrates our core strength in surrounding a disease state with the most innovative and complete solution across multiple product segments such as access guidance diagnostics visualization recording mapping navigation and advanced ablation af remains one of the most attractive med tech markets and we believe we are well positioned for future growth with ensite precision we are encouraged by the results todate of our launch in europe with over  cases already performed and continued positive feedback our advanced mapping portfolio grew approximately  constant currency in europe with ensite precision as compared to essentially flat growth in the us where we await approval we continue to expect us approval and launch of ensite precision in the second half of  i will now turn to our neuromodulation business we continue to capture share in our neuromodulation business and grow at above market rates as illustrated by second quarter global constant currency growth of  this is the seventh consecutive quarter in which we have taken share since the us launch of our drg system we have received positive feedback from our customers with the field experiencing exceptional outcomes and trialing success during our targeted rollout phase drg is designed for focal pain conditions often characterized by nerve injury and it can be debilitating to patients our early real world experience confirm our findings in the accurate ide study which demonstrated sustained and superior pain relief over tonic stimulation we view drg as a market expansion story and part of our larger strategy to surround chronic pain another bright spot in our neuromodulation portfolio is burst technology we continue to see strong enthusiasm in international markets and still expect the fda approval in the second half of  we are also encouraged by the broader adoption of our advanced scs therapies and have seen a shift to our nonrechargeable prodigy platform which now makes up approximately  of our us mix although still early we are hearing very positive feedback on the launch of our new infinity deep brain stimulation or dbs system and directional lead in europe this system is available in maintenancefree and longlasting rechargefree systems similar to our scs systems the infinity platform is upgradeable which provides patients the potential to access new therapy advances as they are approved the us market makes up more than half of the  million global dbs market with only one competitor we are very excited about our innovation here and remain on track for us approval in the second half of  with the most comprehensive neuromodulation technology we expect to remain share takers for the foreseeable future in our cardiovascular portfolio we had several important regulatory and sales milestones that support our ability to execute on our innovation strategy bringing to market new technologies to take share while supporting market growth in our more traditional business segments we were pleased by the positive outcome of the fda pfo panel in may the advisory panel responded favorably to the technology and clinical results voting that the safety effectiveness and benefits of the amplatzer pfo occluder outweigh potential risk this device presents an important treatment option for patients with a pfo who have suffered a stroke of unknown cause and live at risk and in fear of suffering additional strokes the discussion during the meeting and resulting vote is an important step toward approval of the technology in the us we look forward to additional discussions with the fda in the coming months and expect approval in the second half of this year our portico sales during the quarter were strong which supports our belief that we can take share in the tavr market in europe in the us we continue to accelerate enrollment in our ide study and recently received approval to add global sites implanting physicians tell us that our tavr device is the easiest to use and they are impressed with our device retrievability and low pacemaker rate our success during the quarter gives us confidence that our tavr program will drive growth in the future building on our foundation of leadership in heart valve technology we launched our nextgeneration trifecta with glide technology in europe and the us during the quarter and are executing on our launch plan we are in the middle of a successful product launch in europe and expect to see similar results in the us as we expand the rollout while surgical valves as a segment is declining we view it as an important part of our comprehensive strategy of surrounding disease states in general and valvular heart disease more specifically our gamechanging oct technology was a bright spot in the quarter growing nearly  on a constant currency basis these results were driven by our new optis mobile system with angiographic coregistration and enhanced stent optimization software optis mobile offers physicians an efficient way to optimize catheterbased procedures for the treatment of vascular disease by combining diagnostic tools designed to improve patient outcomes into one portable device the imaging advancements offered with the optis mobile system allow physicians to clearly visualize complex cardiac anatomy and evaluate how to best proceed during percutaneous coronary interventions or pci in addition we have received positive physician feedback on our optis metallic stent optimization software which is available in some international markets and delivers tools to further improve stent sizing and placement while providing deployment and placement assessment for drugeluting and baremetal stents our pci optimization business grew approximately  constant currency during the quarter which gives us confidence that we are focused on the right markets with the right technology to generate strong growth for the foreseeable future while we continue to see pressure in our more mature cardiovascular businesses we remain confident that we are focused on outcomesbased technologies in the appropriate growth areas such as pci optimization tavr and percutaneous heart pumps to help drive growth back to the midsingle digits on an annual basis moving to our traditional crm business similar to the past several quarters our us crm business was challenged primarily due to the mrisafe product gap in both low and highvoltage devices we remain confident that this issue is transient and will resolve itself once we receive fda approval of our mrisafe pacemakers and icds which we continue to expect in the second half of  and the first half of  respectively as we have said in the past our experience in international markets shows that once we receive approval for these devices our share returns in short order the most recent example of this was in japan where we received approval early this year for our mrisafe icd which led to japan icd growth revenue of over  constant currency in the second quarter it is this experience and our continued ability to gain share in europe that give us confidence our share will return once we receive approval of mrisafe devices in the us in the evolving healthcare landscape it is more important than ever to be able to work with our customers to contract along the cardiovascular service line we believe we are unrivalled in the depth and breadth of our af heart failure and crm portfolio particularly once we receive mrisafe labeling we are already able to offer contracting solutions to our customers with important innovation in markets where we are improved including mpp syncav ensite precision laa closure nanostim ablation catheters and once approved we look forward to including the nextgeneration disruptive confirm an insertable cardiac monitor technology in fact i think we are better positioned now than ever before to work with the electrophysiologist in every case we look forward to bringing this technology to the us in the near future to drive growth similar to what we have seen in our international markets before we conclude i would like to give a brief update on our pending transaction with abbott it has been about  days since we announced the transaction and ive spent a lot of time with miles white abbotts chairman and ceo i am confident that we will bring together two industry leaders with a shared passion for patients innovation and a strong team culture we have established an integration team with functional area leaders from our respective organizations working to prepare for a seamless integration after the deal closes which we currently expect to occur by the end of  while we are still early in the process i can share that employees are extremely excited about the opportunity for our combined organization to be even more competitive in the market together we will hold number  or number  market positions across a broad range of cardiovascular diseases as well as in diabetes chronic pain movement disorders and vision care i thought it would be worth mentioning that since the announcement ive had many opportunities to hear from our customers patients investors and other external stakeholders that ive been extremely encouraged that the vast majority of people ive spoken with share our enthusiasm for this transaction the strategic rationale is clear as is our shared vision to create the worlds premier medical device company i am confident in the power of our combined organization and the significant impact we can have on helping physicians and patients around the world thank you for joining us today and with that we will conclude the call and turn it
