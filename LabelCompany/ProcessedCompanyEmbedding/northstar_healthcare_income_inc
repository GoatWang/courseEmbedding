a real estate investment trust or reit is a company that pools the money of many investors and purchases a diversified professionallymanaged portfolio of commercial real estate assets reits are legally required to pay  percent of taxable income as dividends and therefore have the potential to provide attractive streams of income there are various types of reits one way in which reits vary is by the type of investments they hold similar to stocks and bonds debtfocused reits and equityfocused reits have different risk and return characteristics holding both in an investment portfolio may help reduce overall portfolio risk debtfocused reits instead of buying properties directly debtfocused reits provide capital to finance commercial real estate properties these reits typically generate income from contractually agreed upon interest payments and are less vulnerable to changing economic conditions however if the borrower lacks sufficient funds distributions may be delayed or not made often debtfocused reits emphasize income generation and preservation of capital and tend to offer better protection against declines in real estate property values than equityfocused reits equityfocused reits equityfocused reits acquire manage operate and sell commercial real estate properties they generate revenue from rent which is the contractual obligation of the tenant once debt service costs and all expenses have been paid equityfocused reits make distributions to investors during periods of economic pressure demand for space may fall and rents may drop causing the income that equityfocused reits provide and the value of the properties they hold to decline during periods of prosperity equityfocused reits may offer the opportunity for growth in investor capital when economic conditions cause property values to rise reits also vary in the ways in which they are bought and sold publiclytraded reits are bought and sold on national securities exchanges and are more liquid than nontraded reits because they are publicly traded they move up and down with the markets and are subject to the same market fluctuations and volatility as other exchangetraded stocks public nontraded reits do not trade on exchanges and are not subject to the volatility of the markets nontraded reits may pay higher distributions than publiclytraded reits although they may also experience less capital appreciation in addition nontraded reits have limited liquidity and lack price transparency in comparison with publiclytraded reits how nontraded reits work  there is no guarantee of distributions distributions have been paid from sources other than cash flow from operations including offering proceeds which may reduce an investor’s overall return publiclytraded reits do not typically pay distributions using offering proceeds there is no guarantee of any return and you may lose a part or all of your investment  there is no guarantee that asset allocation will assure a profit or protect against loss in a broadly declining market  nontraded reits like publicly traded reits remain subject to the risk of declining values resulting from changes related to the fundamentals of the company and its underlying properties reits at a glanceinvestment overviewinvestment strategywhy senior housingoffering detailshow to invest   northstar healthcare income inc all
