saul wurman seeks ways to make the complex clear recognizing at an early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset he has made it his mission to sort through the abundance of information that is available on every topic and design the techniques to make it understandable in doing so he has continually sought to put himself in the presence of extraordinary people including all now all deceased in the sciences francis crick richard feynman and jonas salk in the arts eva zeisel louis i kahn and charles eames in communications steve jobs and frank stanton in history and archaeology schuyler van renssalaer cammann and arnold toynbee there are many others the only two bosses he ever had who didnt fire him were lou kahn and charlie eamesas a result wurman has had many lives as an author

written designed and published  books on a range of topics while creating conferences and new mapping projects all contribute to a greater understanding of complex information they spring from his particular brand of innovation doing the opposite of what is rote or expected of these characteristics nancye green wrote â€¦as an architect rsw has been responsible for building a community addicted to curiosity he continues to put himself out there inventing and reinventing the ways we see and experience anything and everything that interests him he has influenced so many of us even if this was not his intentionwurman published his first two books in  the first featured models of  world cities all constructed on a uniform scale the other was the first book to be written on louis kahn in  he coauthored the first comparative statistical atlas of major american cities his latest book is called  understanding change  the change in understanding it chronicles the adventures and musings of the

profound through his books and his instructional manuals he has been exceedingly exceptional in informing the public about critical issueswurman began his career in conferences in  when he chaired the international design conference in aspen he then cochaired the first federal design assembly in  and the annual aia conference in  with each of these he changed the fundamentals of how gatherings were run all these helped his creative molding of ted tedmed eg and the upcoming www conference now in development says acclaimed architect frank gehry the programs conferences and books that he has developed have created an interactive dialogue between artdesign and many of the disciplines in all fields on a wide range of all topics from technology education entertainment medicine and science to name a fewwurman created the ted conference in  which he chaired through the  meeting ted brings together many of americas clearest thinkers in the fields of technology entertainment and design he created the eg conference in  and the tedmed conference in  which he chaired through  other conferences he created and chaired include california  tedsell tednyc tedkobe in japan and tedcity in toronto noted graphic designer and typographer stefan sagmeister said that â€¦he has had the most profound influence on our industry he pioneered and basically invented the field of information architecture he created and chaired ted conferences which might have become the single most important communication platform for our own field and many others and thereby connecting design effectively to science technology education politics and entertainmentnow in his th year wurman continues to quell his restless intellect with a series of new projects the www conference will be an active gathering of some of the brightest thinkers of our time discussing the complexity of emerging patterns on our planet in improvised conversation â€“ intellectual jazz in partnership with esri and

description additional information reviews  description david roberts was the first british painter to make an artistic expedition to egypt and the holy land the result of his travels was a picturesque vision of the near east that has been hugely influential ever since nearly  years later his work is held in institutions such as the library of congress in washington and london’s victoria and albert museum the folio society limited edition of the holy land and egypt and nubia which replicated the size of the original edition was enormously popular and quickly sold out david roberts was an artist with ambition born in relative poverty outside edinburgh he spent years developing his skills as an apprentice and a jobbing artisan graduating to a career painting backdrops for the theatre ﬁrst in edinburgh and then in london’s covent garden and drury lane by  he had achieved renown for his landscape paintings of the rhine and spain unlike most artists who relied on sketches brought back by other travellers roberts had visited these countries himself his adventurous approach and his technical brilliance would serve him well on the journey of a lifetime – an artistic pilgrimage to egypt and the holy land the ﬁrst ever undertaken by a british artist roberts set oﬀ in august  travelling from london to marseilles and on to alexandria from there he began his journey up the nile with a crew of six men in cairo he determined to record modern buildings as well as ancient and made sketches of minarets alleys and marketplaces his observations remain among the few records we have of the early thcentury city ultimately continuing as far south as abu simbel roberts produced over  sketches on his journey through egypt saying ‘we shall see what impression they make in england’ roberts next set his sights on palestine he travelled across the sinai desert along the route thought to have been taken by the israelites when they left egypt for the promised land he and his team slept in tents under the stars and took shelter in the monastery of st catherine where roberts produced some of his most famous vistas of the holy land jerusalem was closed to visitors because of plague but roberts’s luck held and he was able to enter during holy week it was the memorable culmination of an extraordinary voyage as well as having visited biblical sites from the mount of olives to jericho he had assembled as he put it ‘one of the richest folios that ever left the east’ on his return to london roberts sought a publisher for his work eventually signing a contract with francis g moon for £ – a vast sum equivalent to over £ today critics and the public lined up to praise roberts’s works when they were ﬁrst exhibited the press lauded the aesthetic quality of his art its historical and topographical accuracy and the grandeur of its subject matter publication of the ﬁrst edition was a slow and enormously expensive process it was printed in sections each one containing six handcoloured lithographs created from the original drawings but moon’s investment paid oﬀ there was no shortage of subscribers with queen victoria to whom the holy landseries is dedicated and charles dickens among those reserving a set roberts’s pictures had caught the imagination of the british public and set a trend for orientalism in art that would continue to shape the way in which the west perceived the east source httpwwwfoliosocietycom additional information weight  kg reviews there are no reviews yet be the first to review “roberts david  ‘the holy land’  ‘egypt and nubia’ folio
