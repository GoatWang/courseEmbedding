rudelle fireside chats are round table discussions conducted using campfire the chatters chris anderson author of the long tail and editor of wired dave goldberg general manager of yahoo music bradley horowitz vp of product strategy at yahoo tim quirk vp of music content and programming at rhapsody moderated by matt and jason from signals topic the long tail the theory of the long tail is that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of “hits” at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail in this chat the participants discuss the impact of the tail mass amateurization the role of reviewsrecommendations and how in the future everyone will be famous for  people sample quotes tim “underdogs have always had a voice we’re just giving ‘em bigger speakers” chris “punk rock was the first ‘democratization of music’ enabling technology the garage” bradley “used to be that you had to earn the right to call yourself an author photographer etc now anyone with a blank is a blank” tim “so in rhapsody a lot of times when we recommend  things we actually already know you like the two on either side” dave “the only user reviews that are useful to me in music are from people who like exactly the same music” chris “choice is only oppressive if you don’t have help making it” tim “personally i have less patience with professional but mediocre music than i do with terrible stuff played by wannabees who are doing it cuz they just want to express themselves” chris “it’s okay that the long tail is full of crap just filter the bad stuff so i don’t have to see it” full transcript after the jump matt let’s start by hearing about what you guys actually do at your respective companies what’s your job chris ok i’ll start i’m editor in chief of wired magazine and the author of the long tail dave i run music at yahoo tim my business card says vp music content and programming which means i oversee the rhapsody teams that touch music content in any way content ops label relations and editorial tim it means i’m a writer with pretensions bradley i am vp of product strategy at yahoo matt and how does the long tail affect your company tim for rhapsody it means that no matter how many artistsalbumstracks we add just about everything gets listened to by somebody tim sometimes lots of somebodies tim sometimes just someone’s mom bradley yahoo’s a big company and it touches us in lots of places we’ve long been about what people call user generated content so reducing the friction in content creation and distribution is a big part of what we’re about matt what do you mean by reducing the friction bradley well use your favorite buzzwords… bradley democratizing publishing bradley mass amateurization bradley used to be that you had to earn the right to call yourself an author photographer etc bradley now anyone with a  is a  bradley camera  photographer bradley keyboard  author bradley ipod  dj bradley etc matt let’s get chris involved here… matt are there specific things about these companies that you find interesting re the long tail things happening at yahoo or rhapsody that aren’t happening elsewhere chris starting with rhapsody i think they’re doing a particularly good job in driving demand down the tail with good filtering ranging from editorial review to finegranularity genres to recommendations chris as bradley mentioned yahoo’s particularly good at peerproduction tools such as flick and free music services such as music videos that encourage exploration matt bradley you mentioned that chris visited yahoo recently was that to give a presentation what was yahoo hoping to learn from him bradley we’re big fans bradley we had chris here last year as well dave chris is a rock star in his own right bradley i think chris articulates a framework and gives vocabulary to many of the principles that the industry has been practicing in a more ad hoc way bradley it’s the expert color commentary that helps us better understand ourselves matt speaking of rock stars interesting sidenote there’s a bevy of rockers in the room the bands egoslavia chris spahn ranch bradley too much joywonderlick tim maybe dave too dave nope no musical talent i just get to work with lots of musicians some with real talent and others hoping to find some chris i’m thinking about starting a wiki to track ex rockers turned tech executives bradley lets form a band dave can be our manager bradley nice matt heh tim tmj’s bassist is an svp on the new media side at a big radio company… matt i think there’s something a little “rock ‘n roll” about the idea of the long tail giving more of a voice to the underdogs outsiders and little guys of the world bradley most definitely and all kidding aside tim well they’ve always had a voice we’re just giving ‘em bigger speakers chris punk rock was the first democratization of music enabling technology the garage matt ha the garage seems to be where bands and tech startups both begin   bradley we’ve been putting on hack days here at yahoo… bradley and it  harkens back to using the office copier to make flyers for the show… dave back to chris’ point yahoo wants to enable consumers to get access to as much content as possible from as many sources as possible but then filter and contextualize it in a way that makes it relevant to you bradley the democratization of creation matt what’s a hack day bradley it’s a day when people dismount the org chart bradley and build something wonderful bradley everyone at yahoo has permission to set aside bradley their day job and create… bradley the hacks range from the absurd to the sublime bradley on the absurd side bradley cal henderson from flickr bradley built something called backyard wars bradley backyard is our intranet bradley this showed two pictures bradley a la hot or not bradley the two individuals had a reporting structure bradley but you didn’t know who was whom’s boss bradley so you guessed bradley and then the system said quot’these people should be promoted  demoted accordingly… because they looked managerial or not matt who’s the boss matt minus tony danza bradley exactly jason isn’t it a shame people have to dismount the org chart to build something wonderful why not make that the rule not the exception jason slightly off topic i know dave the old media model particularly radio and television was about push and rhapsody and yahoo are about pull with help the long tail doesn’t make sense if you are going to push the same things to everyone tim actually i’d say rhapsody has push and pull in it — there’s not just one way you want to experience emusic tim sometimes you just wanna push a button and have all the work done for you tim …other days you want to build the perfect playlist chris one size filter doesn’t fit all dave i agree with you tim we have both as well it is a complete continuum in digital music between push and pull the old world was only listen to a radio station or listen to this cd tim so we try to provide a range of tools all of which hopefully learn enough about you to always be floating something new andor interesting to you chris what you want when you’re first exploring a genre isn’t necessarily what you want when you’re looking for new stuff in a genre you already know well bradley i am actually in love with flickr interestingness i think it does a great job of solving the problem of discovery in a world where anyone can say anything search alone doesn’t really provide enough value bradley therein lies the opportunity imho matt how much conflict is there between the long tail and the paradox of choice that barry schwartz talks about can filters tastemakers and recommendation engines really reduce all this stuff to a manageable level matt how do you keep people from being overwhelmed dave i think we need to make it easier still tim absolutely though the chaos is part of the fun dave but the younger you are the more likely you are to want more control chris i address this in a chapter but basically choice is only oppressive if you don’t have help making it imagine the web without google and yahoo dave music is also different than other media forms in that it is more binary matt how so dave people either love a song or hate it with very little in between tim the original pp napster had a paralyzing effect on a lot of people after a few days of going crazy with it tim you knew there was more music out there to be had but if you couldn’t think of what to type in the search box it was very frustrating chris one of the key lessons is that you need to have both ends of the curve start with the familiar hits and then use recommendation and other filters to find the niches based on expressed taste tim chris is spot on we learned this with our classic rock vault station tim it had tons of great tunes that had fallen out of the canon tim but average listening times weren’t as high as we’d expected tim so we started fiddling with the playlist sandwiching the forgotten tracks in between more well known stuff tim and listening times shot up tim but if we started with the small faces people clicked away tim so in rhapsody a lot of times when we recommend  things we actually already know you like the two on either side tim and it’s the one in the middle we want to turn you on to the other  gain your trust matt so people want the familiar stuff mixed in with the rarities dave narrative is different i will sit through a few bad minutes of video or a bad chapter in a book but continue with the experience in the hope it will get better if you know you don’t like metallica you don’t need to hope it gets better dave i think video writing and photos have a longer tail with more consumption than music dave no offense but most unsigned bands are very bad and consumers are not interested in them tim a lot of signed bands are very bad chris i agree with dave the rise of the blogosphere as the long tail of media is a very big deal chris in writing people often want a narrowtargeted focus that commercial media can’t scale down to dave however writing video and photos can be good coming from amateurs bradley fortunately the bad musicians can take up jobs as tech execs tim personally i have less patience with professional but mediocre music than i do with terrible stuff played by wannabes who are doing it cuz they just want to express themselves dave i think the user gen video content will not replace  and lost but certainly can be entertaining and informative chris it’s okay that the long tail is full of crap just filter the bad stuff so i don’t have to see it bradley amen brother anderson tim before rhapsody our motto at listencom was we listen to shit so you don’t have to tim unofficial motto that is chris  dave agreed just saying there is more likely to be better results from a filter of the other content than music bradley there’s an interesting social overlay on this bradley that we see in flickr bradley it’s not about crap or not… bradley one man’s crap is another man’s treasure bradley i want to see pictures of my brother’s kid… bradley but not of every kid in flickr bradley so the audience is dictated not necessarily by quality bradley but by context as well… tim well the most popular stuff in our service is all pretty slickly produced tim but yes i have been pleasantly surprised with how adventurous folks seem to be after they listen to the pop hits tim everyone goes off in a different direction chris i think the rise of usergenerated content is invariably going to be messy nobody cares if every tag is relevant as long as some of them are matt tim how important is the editorial guidance vs the recommendation engines tim who says they’re different tim our recommendation engine is built on top of subjective editorial decisions dave i think production quality for all user gen media is on very steep positive trend upward dave creative quality is a different story matt our recommendation engine is built on top of subjective editorial decisions …how’s that work tim it works like this when we build an algorithm that’s going to make recommendations we base it on connections that subjective human beings our editors have drawn between artists albums tracks and genres tim also our general approach is that when we have to run an algorithm on large batches of material we then go in and handpolish as many of the results as we can to make them as perfect as possible matt i’m curious when you personally shop for products how often do you use filtering like “customers who bought this item also bought…” jason i glance at it but i rarely follow it i do think it helps me frame the current product i’m looking at though chris i find that quite useful because it addresses my expressed interests of the moment by contrast i don’t find the greeting recommendations useful because they’re built on my interests in the past dave it works very well in music and i personally use it a lot in shopping to broaden my consideration set before purchase dave we use our ratings database as one filter in music dave however we also allow you to find other users who can help you more directly tap into what you are looking for dave so if i know that chris is a punk expert and i am looking for new punk music dave i can tap into his much deeper knowledge base directly and try some new music out dave and i don’t have to ask him directly or even know him to do this chris tim are you going to allow usergenerated reviews on rhapsody tim eventually sure but probably off in their own area so anyone who wants to read ‘em can and others can avoid tim it’s really tough to prevent things like that from degenerating into eminem sux no you suck tim and i’m personally a little leery of the falselyauthoritative wiki approach though it obviously has a lot of benefits that outweigh my puny concerns chris for the record i was more new wave than punk sadly that’s actually more embarrassing dave we think user tags are good for music but we find written music reviews whether from our editors or from fans to have little value add tim that’s interesting to me dave in the downsizing days i saved a lot of my editors’ jobs by demonstrating how much more they did than just write and actually deprioritized writing for a while but users and even execs found that they missed the blurbs and wanted more tim so we’ve actually wound up increasing the amount of typing we do tim in a subscription environment context is supremely important dave we actually think of them more as programmers who read the tea leaves of what users are listening to and then figure out how to get more of what tastemakers like to a larger group dave what i describe as smart push or assisted pull tim with so much material you need info about what you’re listening to or what you might listen to matt chris we usually hear about the long tail in terms of big companies like yahoo and rhapsody a lot of our readers are smaller companies entrepreneurs etc how do these ideas apply to them chris right now most of the opportunity for the little guys is on the producer side get aggregated by big companies like these two or by someone like amazon or ebay but i do think we’ll eventually see a long tail of content aggregators just as we see a long tail of search in the form of vertical search with different companies dominating different verticals chris do you guys think that amazon’s reviews are also of little value or if not what are they doing right dave i think reviews are great for narrative dave books movies tv dave just doesn’t work for music tim i like amazon’s user product reviews a lot — they help me choose which of two toaster ovens to buy for instance i don’t pay too much attention to media reviews on there tim although it’s fun to watch creationists try to debunk any books on evolution… chris my concern is that professional reviews don’t scale down to the long tail there’s just too much music out there to keep up with only peerproduction can get to all of it dave chris i think even user reviews would become just noise chris one man’s noise is another man’s signal dave the only user reviews that are useful to me in music are from people who like exactly the same music i do tim it’s maybe important to note that we don’t exactly review music in rhapsody — we provide context hopefully witty and engaging context but it’s not a thumbs upthumbs down approach bradley i think dave hits upon an important point bradley we’re discovering in systems like y answers bradley that reputation becomes increasingly important… matt chris tell me more about this long tail of content aggregators any examples in mind chris well we’re starting to see vertical digg clones we just started one called lipstick that’s focused on fashion and celebrities i can imagine thousands of those tim i could name a dozen already… chris timdave can you imagine vertical music sites on classical or jazz dave i think maybe in classical because it is such a different set of problems to solve tim rhapsody had a classical and a jazz version when we first launched but it turns out most folks want everything even if  of their time is going to be spent in just one genre dave in general vertical music sites don’t work because people’s taste are very diverse and since there is little reason for us or rhapsody to exclude someone it is easier to use our services chris perhaps you guys could white label your technology for verticals… bradley i’d like to ask a question of chris… bradley chris  bradley what is the impact of intrinsic value with respect to the long tail bradley and by this i mean… bradley mission impossible  cost a lot of money to produce… bradley whereas al gore at a podium… not so much bradley is media consumption entirely market driven it’s worth what someone will pay for it… bradley or is what someone will pay for it somewhat infected by their a priori notions of what it is objectively worth bradley or in other words i could foresee spending some of my attention watching a skateboarding dog on youtube… bradley but damned if i’d ever consciously reach into my wallet and pay for a skateboarding dog video… tim along those lines i want to know why people have no problem paying  or  dollars for a ringtone that isn’t an entire song but balk at paying a buck for the actual song itself jason i want to know why people have no problem paying  or  dollars for a ringtone that isn’t an entire song but balk at paying a buck for the actual song itself — i think it’s because they know one option for the song is to steal it read free while there are no other options for the ring tones jason if people pirated ring tones like they pirate music no one would be paying  or  for a ringtone plus a lot of ringtones are tied to a closed device in one way or another so they can’t flow freely like mps can chris i think you have to ask how much of the cost in making blockbusters turned into consumer benefit the m in marketing not so much tom cruise hmm the special effects script other talented filmmaking a lot my sense is that the intrinsic value of the movies is more than the speech but not as much more as their budgets imply bradley totally agree bradley i am very curious to see what happens with the cultural artifact of celebrity in light of the long tail chris bradley it’s a good question but fortunately the marketplace can answer it money is just one scarcity function time which can be turned into money through advertising is another bradley agree mostly chris chris as for music i think the market is shifting to one more like other media which is freetoair and monetized in other ways concert ticket sales have doubled over the past five years even as music sales are flattodown bradley i’d love to see things flatten out matt with the long tail more artists will start to see money for their work — but not enough to make a living off it… matt that money is coming out of the pockets of fulltime artists though does the longtail mean it will actually become more difficult to make a career out of being a musician author etc matt or is there some sort of trickledown theory here where the pie will get bigger and everyone will make more  tim on the contrary i’m making more money from my music now than i ever did as a full time musician signed to warner tim and tvmoviescommercials are licensing ever more obscure acts tim i just got back from ireland where the best musicians in the world play for free nightly in pubs they even have to buy their own drinks tim they just do it for respect like chris says of  people matt as money moves to what chris calls the onesies and twosies it moves away from career artists though doesn’t it chris i think we’re going to have more celebrities but also smaller ones in the future everyone will be famous for  people quote from scottish artist momus matt that’s a great quote chris the big career artists make most of their money from touring already chris my guess is that it will be easier to make a career as an artist but only if you can make money from something other than selling the primary product tim matt why do you think it’s going to be harder to make a living making music because of all the clutter you have to rise above bradley i think matt’s question is really valid bradley it’s not just about clutter bradley it’s that when your selling less of more is the less enough  to put food on the table for the more matt i just think people have a certain amount of time to spend on music as that goes to smaller artists it means it’s tougher to make enough money to live off by selling music matt  people getting  each as opposed to  person getting  bradley right matt my math’s bad but ya get the point i think chris most artists aren’t expecting to quit their day job chris and that’s a good thing too tim i think it’s more like  people getting  each rather than  person getting  million tim back to ireland my contention has always been that musicians make music regardless of ifhowwhen they’ll get paid tim and suddenly there’s actually ways for money to come their way that don’t require a series of middlemen to intercept it all chris we can now define artist so expansively it’s basically anybody who creates and increasingly that’s most of us one way or another chris dave how long can you extend the tail of music does it make economic sense to go to m tracks dave can’t hurt to go to  mm dave but not needed matt chris what’s the best question you’ve been asked while promoting the book chris people are really worried about the loss of common culture and the fear that it’s going to lead to a polarized world like the political blogosphere matt is that a valid fear chris i don’t think so partly because politics is already so polarized and angry and partly because we have so many interests that i expect our many quot’tribes of affinity will expose us to more voices and points of view not fewer chris but i’m an optimist  comments so far jump to latest bob  aug  i noticed ringtones mentioned in the discussion getting ringtones for free is amazingly easy most phones support common audio formats such as midi and mp most geeks would put an mp or midi on their phone and wonder why people pay most nontechnical people simply aren’t aware this is possible and the mechanisms for buying ringtones via phone sms or web are really simple since it’s simple no one really thinks about it perhaps there’s a lesson there ie what if record companies had seen the need for digital music before napster came along maria making pictures  aug  the long tail theory is very interesting i guess it was based on a scientific research or some kind of deterministic forumla which proves the theory less super stars would be great anyway thank you for sharing this theory with me  anonymous coward  aug  by zeus if one more person says “viral” i’m going to kill them the colonel  aug  anonymous coward who said viral lovingly yours the colonel mark  aug  these fireside chats are interesting but i find them hard to read because of the length and the fact they are restricted to a relatively small column it’d be much cooler as a podcast but of course that would go against the marketing and the use of the tool in general then again though the way it’s being presented here all at once and static isn’t the way the product works either — if we’re going to go with the line of reasoning that it’s better to show folks reality instead of wireframes and mockups so here’s a thought… would it be possible to capture the conversation as it occurs and then record it to video that way we could follow along with the action as it occurs having the same experience as those involved while giving us a lot less burden to read just a thought sam  aug  record it to video quite possibly the most boring thing you can ever do is watch others type smacks head on table these are really cool though i’ve enjoyed all of them i would love to see a conversation with  one of the django guys  michael bierut or  merlin mann mark  aug  i don’t know sam — reading an article on the long tail in a format of more than  words spread across what amounts to about  paragraphs in a ” wide column ranks right up there and no i don’t want to watch anyone literally type either all i’m suggesting is that there has to be a better way to present this breaking up the text and giving us an experience more like the reality but “better” i guess is one idea des traynor  aug  i kind of agree with mark there is a reason that books aren’t printed on receipts it’s too much text in too narrow an area i’d like to read it in the original campfire style i don’t mind catching up with long conversations in that manner hubris sonic  aug  i think the polarization of the political blogs merely reflect the current political situation i wouldnt read too much into it chris blood  aug  i really liked the discussion of usergenerated reviews with music they do tend to degenerate into … well garbage but i have a pretty good natural filter for that and i suspect most people do i’ll rarely look at these reviews if i’m buying a cd from a band i know i like even if i’m not sure i’ll like the cd and they won’t convince me to buy a cd from a band i know i’ll hate but they are exceptionally useful when you’re checking out a new band with five or six cds and you want a sense of what you might like most or find most accessible as a newcomer even without a reviewratings system you can scan for keywords maybe you’ll find something described as “funky” more desirable than “soulful” or whatever so i sort of skim them as though they were tags but then find more value in the surrounding review in terms of evaluating whether i’m likely to agree with this person thanks for the chat jameson  aug  the text on this page is much closer to the column width of a book than a receipt it only seems like a receipt relative to the width of your browser window if you allow that width to stand in for the “book” and scale down you might not find it uncomfortable to read this conversation at px wide or more but most of us would especially since at that width most of it would be one or one and a half lines at a time — very easy to lose your place not that this should be the focus of the comments i’m always astonished at the minutiae people will get critical about on svn i guess it proves you’re doing a lot of stuff right if the only stuff people can pick on is miniscule this was a very interesting chat and something that concerns us all we’re all consumers and a rapidly increasing number of us are becoming producers as well so even if we don’t work at rhapsody we can find a lot value in this sort of discussion well moderated well done thanks jen  aug  an analysis of the long tail and lesserknown artists httpdigitalaudioinsiderblogspotcombandwidththoughtsparthtml joseph ferrarasellsius  sep  a few questions  is it true that no one has defined exactly where the long tail begins  does pareto’s principle support the proposition that the long tail is only  of the total market  at the time of the study did amazon get  of its total sales from affiliates  did walmart sell more music cds than any long tailer despite it having a limited inventory  is nextflix’s success more a function of it being a first mover than a long tail
