downgrades sanford floridas utility sys revs to a from aa outlook stable  business wire fitch downgrades sanford floridas utility sys revs to a from aa outlook stable march    pm eastern standard time austin texasbusiness wirefitch ratings downgrades the following city of sanford fls the city outstanding revenue bonds  million utility system revenue refunding bonds series  to a from aa the rating outlook is stable rating rationale the downgrade to a reflects a weakening of the financial profile particularly with regard to dwindling liquidity levels financial margins are satisfactory for the rating level and management is taking steps to evaluate additional rate increases and set minimum reserve targets to enhance margins the debt profile is somewhat elevated but fiveyear capital needs are manageable and amortization is rapid while the system appears to have sufficient rate flexibility the service territory is experiencing elevated economic pressures as demonstrated by very high unemployment and poverty rates key rating drivers replenishment of reserves to at least the target minimum in the near term will be critical development of an alternative water supply andor resumption of rapid growth could strain system operations continued progress toward consent decree requirements without excessive future borrowing will be important to minimizing additional fixed costs security the bonds are secured by net revenues of the water and sewer system net revenues exclude system development charges credit summary the water and sewer system the utility has historically yielded good senior lien and adequate allin debt service coverage while coverage of senior lien debt service has remained strong the utilitys allin annual debt service ads coverage dropped to  times x in fiscal  the decline reflected increased employeerelated operating costs that were not fully offset by an increase in operating revenues water sales have declined by approximately  since fiscal  due to a combination of increased conservation arrested economic growth and increased property vacancies in reaction to the weak fiscal  results management adopted a  water rate increase for fiscal  and a  rate increase for both water and sewer for fiscal  as a result allin ads improved to x and senior lien ads came in at x in fiscal  furthermore allin ads and senior lien ads were an estimated x and x in fiscal  respectively on an unaudited basis the city is currently involved in a rate study but preliminary plans are to continue to index rates annually through fiscal  with the exception of fiscal  when a fixed  rate hike may be implemented to offset additional state revolving fund srf loan debt issuance planned for that year the average monthly bill is currently affordable at  of median household income but an already stressed rate base characterized by high unemployment and poverty rates could end up paying a monthly bill that approaches fitchs affordability threshold of  of median household income despite the rate increases and improvement in coverage unaudited fiscal  results show complete depletion of operating reserves with unrestricted cash at just  day of operating expenses system development charges on which the system had relied for paygo funding of growthrelated capital projects and payment of expansionrelated debt service declined by  in fiscal  and  in fiscal  the utility used cash reserves for these purposes including funding mandated capital projects furthermore the series  bonds debt service reserve fund had to be cashfunded in  when the surety providers rating was withdrawn adding to the drain on reserves going forward the city plans to shift its use of any growthrelated fees away from making ads payments management is also setting an unrestricted operating fund target of  days of operating expenses and an allin debt service goal of x compared to a sumsufficient rate covenant utility debt per capita is moderately high at  though this concern is offset by rapid principal amortization at  and  in  and  years respectively and manageable capital costs the fiscal  to  capital improvement plan cip totals  million of which  is for funding of regulatory projects approximately  million is to meet consent order requirements to reduce effluent nutrient levels to satisfy new regulatory mandated limits the city plans to issue srf loans to cover the costs of the wastewater facility upgrade and to comply with the disinfection byproduct rule for its potable water distribution system the remainder of the cip is for the development of alternative water supplies projects dedicated to reducing high unaccountedfor water loss and rehabilitation and repair the st johns river water management district sjrwmd regulates the withdrawal of raw water management estimates that its current allocation is sufficient to meet demand through  but if rapid population growth resumes the cost of securing a new water source is liable to increase substantially the utility serves an estimated population of  annual population growth had been rapid at  through  but growth has been stagnant over the last three years the service territory has been experiencing severe economic pressures as evidenced by a city unemployment rate as of november  at  above county  state  and national  levels the poverty rate in fiscal  was also a high  compared to
