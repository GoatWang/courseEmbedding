th  for santee cooper printerfriendly version cayce sc july  …  south carolina electric  gas company sceg principal subsidiary of scana corporation scana nysescg and santee cooper have entered into a definitive agreement with toshiba corporation toshiba for toshiba to pay  billion  billion to sceg for its  and  billion to santee cooper for its  project ownership in full satisfaction of its guaranty of obligations of westinghouse electric company llc wec under the engineering procurement and construction contract the epc contract for the two new nuclear units at the vc summer nuclear station in jenkinsville sc  in the agreement toshiba commits to make payments in a series of installments over a period beginning in october  and ending in september   certain of these payments may be satisfied by distributions through the bankruptcy court process from wec to sceg and santee cooper  these payments which are subject to reduction if wec pays creditors holding liens on project assets are payable regardless of whether both or either of the two nuclear units are completed or the project is abandoned  if the units are completed and upon completion actual construction costs net of payment from toshiba are less than the specified maximum amount payable under the epc contract toshiba will have the right to receive part of the difference  the project owners are continuing their efforts to determine the most prudent path forward for the nuclear project  however the project owners anticipate that the additional cost to complete both units beyond the amounts payable in connection with the epc contract will materially exceed prior wec estimates as well as the anticipated guaranty settlement payments from toshiba additionally the units would need to be online before january   to qualify for production tax credits under current tax rules  at this point the project owners believe that the units could not be brought online until after this date  the project owners are considering these factors as well as their future generation needs in their evaluation of the project  based on these considerations the alternatives of completing both units or one unit are subject to significant challenges  the owners expect to announce their decisions soon “we are committed to making a financially responsible decision for our customers and other stakeholders” said scana chairman and ceo kevin marsh  “we are close to completing our analysis of the various options to determine the most prudent path forward lonnie carter santee cooper president and ceo said “we appreciate our customers’ patience while the analysis on cost and schedule for the project is being completed  ultimately we will make a decision that is in the best interests of our customers”
