executive officer good afternoon and thank you for joining us for a review of cepheids second quarter results this was the solid quarter of execution across the company including research and development operations and sales and marketing delivering an important return to growth in north america and a number of exciting account wins and announcements that we believe will set us up well for a strong revenue ramp in the back half of the year total revenue of  million was up  from last year or  in constant currency this included  growth in north america while international revenue grew  or  in constant currency system and other revenue of  million was solid while reagents and disposable revenue of  million grew  yearoveryear or  in constant currency as noted this was quite a strong system quarter in terms of the commercial business we set a new second quarter record for system placements and in fact delivered the second strongest commercial system placement quarter ever cumulative system placements in north america are now more than  and total global placements now comfortably exceed  global placements included  infinity systems including three infinities through our new distribution partner henry schein this of course highlights a moderate complexity opportunities for our polpoc distributors we have previously been discussing this point mckesson and medline have now also completed training with cepheid and we are pleased with the building pipeline of business that all three of our nonacute distribution partners are developing clearly it remains early days but we are encouraged with what were seeing todate hbdc placements were also strong you will recall that we were expecting an additional  systems to be placed in india in the second quarter and we did successfully recognize approximately  systems of that number during the quarter the remaining units are expected to be recognized in the third quarter moving to reagents revenue grew  yearoveryear or  in constant currency with record revenue in each of our franchise families hais critical infectious disease excluding flu sexual health virology and oncology and genetics reagents were up  from last quarter with sequential growth across all of our franchise family again excluding flu more than offsetting the greater than  million decline in our seasonal flu sales cepheid continues to be recognized as the leader in molecular hai testing this is a responsibility we take seriously and we continue to deliver important test to support infection control efforts at the hospital level and to aid and to fight against antimicrobial resistance at a global level and just the last month we have further extended our hai portfolio in the us to include surveillance claims for xpert carbar for detection of carbapenemresistant organisms which represent a significant and emerging problem here in the us as noted by the cdc highrisk patients for example those admitted from longterm care facilities patients who receive medical care in endemic regions andor patients admitted to highrisk settings such as intensive care units should be tested at admission and potentially periodically during their facility stay for cre xpert carbar has the potential to be an important tool in helping hospitals of all sizes manage the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance unfortunately it is likely a question of when not if these super bugs become more prevalent and a surveillance test that delivers results in minutes not days could dramatically improve patient outcomes and the hospitals ability to manage outbreaks were also adding a new test to our family of c difficile products outside of the us xpert c diff bt as you may be aware that xpert c difficile includes a target for binary toxin in addition to toxin b used to make a presumptive call for the hypervirulent  strain importantly recent studies have shown that the presence of the binary toxin strains other than  have also been associated with poor outcomes and a high relapse rate other studies have also shown that some strains that test negative for toxin by eia but are nonetheless binary toxin positive may be associated with clinical disease with that in mind some cepheid customers have shown interest in a separate call out for the binary toxin so we will be releasing xpert c diff bt which allows for an independent reporting of binary toxin results in addition to toxin b further we are excited about the data emerging from several studies showing that independent of binary toxin status bacterial load estimates generated by the xpert c diff test may correlate with disease severity likelihood of recurrence and toxin production taken together we believe that the potential of the existing test design which remains bestinclass is now beginning to be more fully realized in critical infectious disease excluding flu recorded record revenue for the quarter driven primarily by strong tb sales in both commercial and hbdc markets while flu was down sequentially as expected it demonstrated solid growth yearoveryear reflecting our increasing share gain in molecular flu accounts and continued progress in accounts adopting our combined flu and rsv test moving to sexual health we had a number of very significant milestones right around the end of the second quarter first following the overwhelming success of the dean street point of care sexual health clinic in london a number of similar services have been launched hammersmith broadway from the same team behind dean street opened its doors in west london in late june and checkpoint paris also opened during the second quarter making std testing ever more accessible we are currently discussing a number of other similar projects that we would see this to be a transformational model of sexual health testing extending further throughout europe and perhaps even to other parts of the world our success in ctng however extends beyond the point of care as you know we have had considerable success in transitioning some portion of the sendout market into inhouse testing we continue to be a key enabler of what we believe will be a continued trend towards test decentralization interestingly however we are also starting to see some success in higher volume testing accounts right at the end of the quarter we added a new us hospital account with a projected volume of about  ctng tests per year this infinity placement displaced an incumbent competitor beat out another competitors bid and is an important further validation of cepheids ability to support high throughput customers in part we secured this placement using a competitive headtohead study conducted by max chernesky professor of pediatrics pathology and molecular medicine at mcmaster university while the full chernesky analysis is yet to be published the first published study compared the workflow on the infinity  directly with the panther whether one or  tests the infinity was found to deliver results more quickly and efficiently than the panther additionally the infinity required substantially fewer disposables to run this system with no waste or incomplete batches and required only  minutes of monthly maintenance compared to two hours and  minutes for the panther we are confident that these chernesky studies will go a long way to help everyone better appreciate the full capabilities of our infinity systems outside the us many countries are preparing to implement a new requirement by the us immigration service for us immigrants age  and older to be tested and if necessary treated for gonorrhea prior to admission to the united states the cdc points to nat or culture testing and also encourages physicians to use less invasive specimens such as urine or selfcollected vaginal swabs the requirements also point to treatment which should be provided onsite or directly observed with those requirements in mind we believe that xpert ctng offers the only practical solution for same day test and treat and therefore could be a valuable tool for doctors and testing services appointed by the us immigration service to conduct immigrant physicals ahead of the october implementation we have already had our first system deployment in guatemala directly linked to this requirement and expect to see some additional activity building as these testing programs are initiated just after the end of the quarter we announced the publication of a study in the journal of clinical microbiology that per the mayor protocol validates the use of xpert hpv as a front line cervical screening test for use outside of us europe is moving substantially more quickly than the us and adopting hpv primary testing so this is an important milestone that means we are now – we can participate more fully in the european market even at advance of the study xpert hpv showed some growing momentum in the quarter so were looking for more solid growth in the back half of the year and into  we are also further encouraged by recent studies showing that xpert hpv test performs just as well for detection of highrisk hpv types or selfcollected vaginal swabs as do physician collected cervical swabs which for the first time enable same day test and treat protocols to be implemented and it avoids dependence on expensive and inconvenient liquid cytologybased collection systems collectively these data position the xpert hpv test as a unique opportunity in cervical cancer provision programs outside of us finally our virology products showed good momentum in the second quarter consistent with our experience with ctng our early wins have primarily been test transitioning from send outs no surprise its taking a little longer to prove our capability as a higher throughput solution that can support even the highest test volumes in a more traditional centralized testing model the chernesky study will help with this and we have a pipeline of higher throughput virology opportunities that we expect to be talking more about as we progress through the year of note we believe our virology test can deliver a particularly differentiated product solution in the pointofcare market one dropin sexual health service in spain for example has introduced our hiv qualitative test for certain patients while these kinds of clinics tend to use the less expensive eias for frontline testing this clinic reflects that some of their negative eias to our pcr test as a result they have identified a number of hivpositive patients that would otherwise have been missed there is value here because a molecular test can pickup hpv earlier than an immunoassay that looks for antibodies that take time to develop this particular clinic evaluates a patients history and for example if the individual has had a partner recently diagnosed with hiv or has particularly risky sexual practices they reflect the negative eia to our test with this approach and during a sixmonth review period they have identified at least six individuals as hiv positive that were not detected by the antibody test enabling those patients to get on antiretroviral therapy more quickly and perhaps lowering transmission risk were encouraged by these developments and other ongoing discussions with potential customers for our virology tests within the portfolio xpert hiv viral load is currently the largest contributor to revenue followed by xpert hcv viral load of note xpert hiv viral load is starting to build some momentum in hbdc ill now move on to an update on the test and systems in our pipeline xpert trichomonas for male urine testing was submitted as expected to the fda during the second quarter xpert mrsa next gen remains on track for submission to fda later this year xpert mtbrif ultra remains on track for release outside of the us later this year and xpert bladder cancer is on track for commercial release outside the us in the fourth quarter xpert breast stratifier is on track for commercial release outside the us around the end of this year  or early  and xpert xpress flu and flursv remain on track for release in both the us and internationally this year with an expected timetoresult for positives in as little as  minutes xpert xpress group a strep remains on track for commercial release in  hiv viral load continues in clinical trials in the us with submissions targeted around the end of the year and finally our hcv viral load also continues in clinical trials and is targeted for submission to fda in the first half of  moving to omni im pleased to share that we are making good progress to give you a little more insight into what happens here the original omni design called for an icore with a single sided heating system in contrast to the proven double sided heating icore that we use in the genexpert as we shared in april this initially look to be working well but it became clear as we ran the system on an ever broader menu of test that the thermal dynamics were not performing as robustly as we expected therefore we made the decision to leverage the double sided heating approach that we use in the genexpert im happy to announce that it looks to be working very well at this point our current expectation is to finalize the new omni icore prototype during the third quarter we will look to update you on our q call but for now i can say that we continue to be confident in meeting the q  timeline for availability in the emerging markets finally we continue to make good progress with the honeycomb system and we are moving toward – forward with the use of the system in the development of our breast signature product with that ill hand the call over to dan daniel madden  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you john and good afternoon everyone please note that i will be discussing nongaap results unless otherwise specified total revenue of  million grew  from the second quarter of  or  on a constant currency basis system and other revenue up  million grew  from the second quarter of  or  on a constant currency basis and reagents and disposable revenue of  million grew  or  on a constant currency basis north american revenue of  million grew  from q of  and includes the impact of a yearoveryear decline in nonclinical revenue and international revenue of  million grew  from the same quarter a year ago driven by both our hbdc and commercial businesses on a constant currency basis international revenue grew  nongaap gross margin of  was flat from last quarter slightly better than expected due to product mix nongaap operating expenses excluding collaborative profit sharing were  million gaap net loss was  million or  per share and nongaap net income for the second quarter was  million or  per share a reconciliation of our gaap results to our nongaap results is available in todays press release moving to the balance sheet cash cash equivalents and investments increased to  million dsos decreased to  days and inventory increased about  million to  million moving to guidance and given that our first half revenue is largely in line with our plan there is no change to the  full year revenue guidance established in december we therefore continue to expect full year revenue in the range of  million to  million it is clear that this revenue guidance points to a stepup in the second half of the year as john discussed we have a number of building catalysts that will impact revenue in q and q notably we expect momentum to continue to build in north america following the return to growth in q included in north america of course we expect to see a growing contribution from our distribution partners which as john noted got off to a good start in q with some particularly large system placements also in north america we should start to see the impact of our recent wins in higher volume ctng accounts in addition to the sexual health clinic business ramping outside the us we expect to see building momentum in hiv qual which received who prequalification in the second quarter and hpv following the completion of the meijer protocol and finally we expect to deliver the remaining  tb tests to india in the second half of  in terms of revenue linearity we have historically seen a sequential decline in revenue moving from q to q this year as a result of the items noted we expect q revenue to grow sequentially then we expect the stepup from q to q to be similar to years past on a percentage growth basis we continue to target nongaap gross margin of approximately  for the full year for the third quarter we expect gross margin to be marginally lower than q due to a higher mix of hbdc sales we then expect q gross margins to be higher reflecting a lower mix of hbdc and the early benefit of our gross margin improvement program we continue to expect full year rd to be flat to slightly down on a percent of revenue basis although up on a dollar basis as we continue to invest in our test menu expansion and system expansion programs further there is no change to our fullyear expectations for sales and marketing and ga which on a percent of revenue basis we expect to remain flat to down modestly compared to  and for  we continue to expect nongaap operating margin of approximately  we are however revising our fullyear gaap and nongaap earnings per share estimates to reflect betterthanexpected other income and expense and income tax expense amounting to about  per share on a gaap basis and about  per share on a nongaap basis with that in mind we now expect gaap net loss per share to range between  and  and nongaap earnings per share to range between  and  before i hand the call back to john a quick update on our gross margin improvement objectives we continue to make steady progress on our initiatives and we started phasing in a new lower cost enzyme in two of our xpert products in june as expected our other manufacturing initiatives are progressing well and are also on track for phasein starting later this year we will update you on these again next quarter but we are pleased with how things look right now we continue to target a nongaap gross margin in the  to  range and a nongaap operating margin in the mid to upper teens for the full year  and we are actively managing our  activities and planning our  activities with that commitment in mind and with that ill turn the call back to john john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer thanks dan in summary this was a solid quarter that we believe set cepheid up nicely for the back half revenue ramp were seeing momentum in our new products particularly carbar and virology we are seeing an increasingly robust pipeline of opportunity for our three us polpoc distribution partners and were seeing north america return to growth from an rd perspective we continue to make good progress on the us virology trials and on our oncology products which dont forget include two bladder cancer and one breast cancer test that are close to commercial release outside of the us were making good progress on omni and honeycomb with both platforms on schedule our manufacturing cost reduction initiatives are progressing well as dan has detailed and we continue to manage the business with the  targets firmly in mind overall this was a clean and solid quarter for cepheid with that ill invite the operator to open the call to questions questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of bill bonello with craighallum your line is open please go ahead william bishop bonello  craighallum capital group llc hey thanks a lot a followup question on the xpress flu do you think that youre going to – you talk about  release do you think you will have that in time for this next flu season and when do you kind of need to have approval in order to be able to effectively market and get orders for the flu season and then just as a tag on to that the turnaround time seems a little bit faster than we had been expecting just curious if you think thats going to hold on omni as well john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer okay certainly bill so couple of questions one in order to really get maximum benefit out of any flu test release you really want to be releasing that product earlier in the year more around summer time august september latest timeframe frankly to really give accounts the opportunity to verify the new product so where we will be releasing earlier will be internationally with ce mark products so certainly i think that one is going to get probably the full benefit of the flu season in the us were going to be a little bit late i think to get the full advantage of the xpress test going in so we may have some accounts but accounts dont generally like to be validating in the midst of the flu season that said we continue to see very good traction with our – even though we have a longer time to results with our existing flu and the flursv products now relative to the question on turnaround time yeah were using there similar to what weve done with a number of our products we call it eat and it means early assay termination so in other words where you have a clearly positive result then there is no need to run fully to completion and thats where the timing will be the shortest so you will see some if they have its a negative then youre going to run all the way to completion and those are going to be a little bit longer relative to the omni the omni – i fully expect that to be just as good as what were seeing right now on the genexpert if not a little bit better remember that going in on the omni that we will be including active cooling there so the big majority of this is how the chemistries make the test run so i dont expect to see a big big difference there basically going to be reacting about the same but if anything the omni will be a little better operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of brian weinstein with william blair your line is open please go ahead brian d weinstein  william blair  co llc hey guys thanks for taking the question i was on another call so i apologize if you hit this earlier but can you talk about early feedback from your distribution partners how youre feeling about those relationships and then on the us sales force are we kind of at full speed after the ramp up of the sales force last year are we seeing full contribution for them or is that still going to accelerate in the back half of the year thanks john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer okay so on the distributor questions yeah were seeing very solid activity with all of our – all three of our distributors recognizing that henry schein group got quite a bit of a head start so weve relatively recently finished training for mckesson and medline were seeing lot of activity there so a building pipeline for them the primary item brian that was really encouraged about as weve been saying all along that there is significant activity and moderate or complexity accounts there and then opportunity in those accounts and weve clearly seen that already with the henry schein placements there and then particularly as we said these were three infinities going into these accounts were also seeing with the accounts from a menu standpoint a lot of interest and a lot of the drivers actually been ctng along with c diff and then some of the accounts were flipflopping back and forth weve seen gbs and some trichomonas so one of the big things weve been saying is we have a menu of  tests which are potentially applicable in that market and we see that in play already so im feeling very good about that relative to the us sales force yes theyre up to full speed but as you would expect and thats what weve planned for in the plan for this year that momentum will continue to build as we go forward in the year and certainly youre seeing that as you look at q now q and expect to see more even greater growth in the us the remainder of the year operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of derik de bruin with bank of america your line is open please go ahead derik de bruin  bank of america merrill lynch hi good afternoon john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer good afternoon derik derik de bruin  bank of america merrill lynch great so acknowledging that you have a – the significant ramp you have in the second half of the year can you – is there any sort of backlog metrics or committed revenues that you could share – some sort of metrics that gives a little bit more comfort other than just sort of the new product ramp and – and whats out there just a little bit more color around your level of confidence in the back half plan thank you john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer well well give you – well give you some and i will give you a little bit of metric which well talk about on the hbdc relative to north america its a combination of items there one we continue to outgrow the market relative to hais we see that continuing with regard to – what we called out in our prepared remarks starting to get some high volume accounts in the ctng as those accounts come online of course those volumes are going to be more realized in the second half of the year so all of that then becomes additive we see the activity with the carba product particularly getting the rectal swabs so that it can be used for surveillance i think its going to be helpful on that product as we look at timing we get there looking for getting the male urinary claim for trichomonas that is going to help i believe also in the us market now other drivers giving you some quantitative aspects which we called out in the call we talked about in hbdc the  units going into india those  units we expect to have those fully finished well most of them are finished as we said q a little bit rolls into q but more importantly is the test volume theres  tests to go with those we only shipped  of the  during the first half of the year the other  tests will come in the second half of the year along with continuing momentum that we see in hbdc now the other areas are a combination of internationally so one in emena were calling out – were seeing increased activity with opening of additional sexual health clinics like dean street those clinics are going to be coming online and of course thats going to be new test volume which given when theyre coming online right now is going to impact more second half of the year going forward were also seeing a ramping with the virology products we called out some examples there in europe and then the other item is were seeing some building momentum in the emerging markets operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of sung ji nam with avondale your line is open please go ahead sung ji nam  avondale partners llc hi thanks for taking the question john could you comment on your outlook for the european market in light of whats going on with brexit and maybe some other macro factors and do you foresee any kind of potential disruption on the regulatory side in terms of getting products cleared and things like that thank you john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer so couple of comments so you – one maybe talk about in europe on the brexit situation on brexit weve seen no negative activity at that point in fact as were seeing – talking about the momentum continues to build now on the regulatory side if youre talking about the new guidelines coming and impacting ce products now i dont see any disruption in that its going to be quite a few years yet for that is actually implemented and then well have the opportunity to go in and address the new guidelines at that point in time so i dont see any disruption to product flow i dont see a slowdown in that regards the things in europe continue to do quite well operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of isaac ro with goldman sachs your line is open please go ahead isaac ro  goldman sachs  co good afternoon thanks for taking the question i wanted to talk a little bit about gross margin its obviously been a key focus for the company and quartertoquarter appreciate there is always a moving – a lot of moving parts in it but was interesting in the comments you made about the enzyme program the things youre doing there on the cost of goods side and im curious if you can maybe quantify the union economics or give us some kind of a benchmark quantitatively in terms of how significant that would be either for the individual product line and maybe ideally kind of across the overall portfolio is that something that could be significant as you roll it out and scale it up thank you john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer so isaac ill answer part of that and then dan can certainly jump in here so yeah wed given some analytics on that before by giving an example were looking at enzyme units on a cost per enzyme unit basis so if we looked at – theoretically if our costs for example were around  per enzyme unit and then we were dropping that cost to around a  so fivefold reduction thats very very significant relative to what were doing so as we make that applicable to new product introductions weve also indicated were going to be applying that against some existing products and those volumes out there once we deplete old inventory the overall impact on the margins is of course quite significant and all that coming straight through the bottom line dan you have additional daniel madden  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah i think you asked more specifically about how does it affect broadly and as weve disclosed before we expect a  basis point improvement taking that fivefold reduction across the variety of products that we expect to transition enzymes in and the benefit of some of our newer products that come out with those lower – and lower cost enzymes so we expect a  basis point impact on gross margins overall in  operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of doug schenkel with cowen  company your line is open please go ahead doug schenkel  cowen  co llc hey good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions just on carbar youve talked about the expectation for this product to be used more in surveillance settings can you give us an idea of how meaningful this product is for the company today how quickly this change in thinking may alter your internal revenue model but i guess bigger picture do you believe this will accelerate hai revenue growth beyond the roughly midsingle digit levels youve targeted over the next few years or should we still think of hais as a mid singledigit grower thank you john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer so right now lets say the jury is still out fully on carbar right now its a i would say its less than c diff relative to clearly an overall opportunity weve just started with the rectal swab claims we have had the product out a while in europe there is a running debate in fact even in europe there was a lot of discussion earlier about using it more broadly as a surveillance product that hasnt yet occurred still being used as a diagnostic product now the factors that i would see impacting in the us markets its going to depend upon the incidents of occurrence that we start seeing here initially we may see diagnostic utility based upon outbreak but as weve indicated there are really – this is a very significant problem with increasing concerns i know there is a lot of discussion within the clinically community on the pros and cons and whats the best way to go here if this moves into a surveillance product then youre going to have something that wed look more in the range of more like a c diff type of a product relative to total revenues that are there for the product as you look at hais in general over time unfortunately the answer to your question is yes i think whats going to happen is we may go along here for next year or so with hais more in the singledigit growth but the adoption of carbar and frankly there is a lot of discussion on c diff right now on looking at potential c diff for identification of carrier status if that comes online later then yes thats going to push the growth of hais up versus where were growing at right now i mean the big thing to say is that this is unfortunate but its a developing problem thats going to exist on a worldwide basis operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bill quirk with piper jaffray your line is open please go ahead william r quirk  piper jaffray  co great thanks good afternoon i guess john on omni does the double heating approach at the icore does that change any of the assay turnaround time metric does it affect the cost of goods at all associated with the system and i guess just lastly are there any other issues that youre working on with the product or is this considered to be the prevailing problem and it now looks like its solved john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer correct bill yeah this was the big problem with the omni of course the big reason for the delay was getting the icore in a really robust manner to your question specifically from a timing standpoint what were seeing right now with the omni i mean i guess within every cloud sometimes there is a silver lining were actually seeing with the design that were running on right now the system is likely going to be more robust than the original design even had we gone forward and it worked broadly with all of the menu the new design is even more robust than where we were so im expecting this to work very well out in the field from a time to result standpoint its going to be i think maybe a little bit better weve maintained the benefit of active cooling on the omni the existing genexpert system doesnt have active cooling of course one of the major attributes or benefits of that is that as youre working particularly in the high burden world and youve got a lot of high ambient temperature having active cooling on board is going to make the system ever more effective in that kind of environment so i think right now things are looking very good with the system were tracking as we said for q  and i think things should go well now relative to your question on cost going to the doublesiding yeah it added a little bit to the cost but nothing significant so our margins here are going to be very good even with the announced pricing that weve already put out there operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jack meehan with barclays your line is open please go ahead jack meehan  barclays capital inc hi thanks good afternoon guys i have a twoparter on hbdc just as were building our second half revenue build what are some of the moving parts between instrument and consumables related to the india order just to keep in mind and then as you look out further there is some new competition looking to enter the market whats your strategy to build on the strength that youve been able to build today thanks john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer so a couple of things so as youve seen already weve actually given the numbers so for india the first half is going to be more weighted on the instrument side second half is more weighted on the test side so the  units being primarily delivered in the first half a few more left to be delivered in q but then the big impact comes with the incremental  tests to be delivered during the second half of the year now its interesting and i really get a kick out of that that youre asking me that question about new competition coming into the market because ive said for a long time that these are very interesting markets and markets of the future and because of the action that weve put out in the market and success frankly yeah you do see competition really trying to move and come into the marketplace a general comment is that we are very well positioned i mean were doing well with the install base that we have now the omni going out into that market is going to extend our reach even more so you go right into the microscopy centers now some of the competition that youre talking about coming into the market there was a report there where our competitors product worked pretty well on the hiv but the big difference is their cost per test is significantly higher than where we are their cost on the system is significantly higher than where we are and the system is quite a bit larger than the omni as we come with the product there and even the battery backup that goes with that is quite a bit larger than where we are so were well positioned the omni is very much the product of tomorrow thats there coming into the market the last item that i would comment there one of the big benefits weve said with the genexpert all along is that with the investment thats been made by all of the ngos in getting the product into the market theyre getting immediate incremental benefit because they can run other tests on the system other than tb and now were seeing that i mean there are already evaluations underway and in some places theyre already utilizing hiv viral load and theyll be using hiv qual and ultimately hcv going into the marketplace so were looking to really leverage one the very large install base that we already have and then two extending our reach with the omni system operator thank you our next question comes from the line of dan arias with citigroup your line is open please go ahead daniel arias  citigroup global markets inc yeah hi good afternoon thanks just going back to the distributors john on the infinity placements that came through henry schein just curious whether there is more of a concerted focus on higher throughput machines for those guys and if so would you expect to see an uptick in the quarterly infinity installs as they get going and then if i could sneak in a quick followup just wanted to confirm that when you say virology is ramping that that means revenues were up sequentially in q thanks john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer okay so on the infinity systems you know its interesting one of the things that ive said about the moderate complexity pol aspect of the market is that they have the advantage of all of our systems right now and thats exactly what played out here so these placements actually started off with initial discussions on a smaller genexpert system and then looking at the breadth of menu looking to be employed there they went to the larger infinity based systems going forward i expect to see more of the same i expect to see combination of genexpert systems but then as an account individually wants to go for broader breadth of menu utilization the infinity is going to really make sense particularly as you look at the smaller infinity  system where we sell at a minimum of  modules so they get really the extra benefit and then they can build and thats the other item that i feel really good about is that theyll be able to – as they start using more menu they build volume then they can add incremental modules on to the system so all of thats working well and thats showing some very good promise on the virology scenario we had strong sequential growth out there on that to your question so yeah we do see that ramping operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of eric criscuolo with mizuho your line is open please go ahead eric j criscuolo  mizuho securities usa inc good afternoon john i didnt hear much on the – much discussion regarding china so i was wondering if you can give us an update on the status there and any developments in particular the large fleet of instruments that were delivered couple of years ago and whats the utilization like right now thanks john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer sure thanks for asking that question actually china is doing very well in fact to your question on the  systems that were delivered over there and to a large extent were sitting dormant the group over there is doing a really good job and the fellow thats heading up china has done an outstanding job and is making progress that those systems are now starting to be utilized so a number of them not fully all of them yet but a number of them now have gone live and being used on a routine basis the other product that we have over there the c diff is actually doing very well and were seeing growing momentum in china so its interesting he sent us a video of the release and looking at everything that were doing with all of the other countries around the world and the breadth of our menu and here they have this release at a trade show in china and the booth was mobbed i mean there were quite a large number of people there and it was for one product and just the c diff so its been making a big impact and as we get more menu in china ill be expecting for a lot larger return so allinall its growing its doing very well operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mark massaro with canaccord genuity your line is open please go ahead mark massaro  canaccord genuity inc hey guys thanks for taking the question i also missed the beginning prepared remarks but i wanted to ask if there is any update to the progress with reference laboratories we were aware that you have at least two large labs are you seeing any increased adoption by assay and can you provide an outlook for adoption of additional labs both in the us and europe thank you john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer yeah well so as weve looked at that i mean our primary customers are using the menu that weve talked about we havent really broadened the menu there we have added a number of other additional reference laboratories there and then specific to your question yeah we have a number of labs in europe reference labs that are utilizing our product and it varies because theyll have branches around the world so we have mixed utilization of the menu in those labs around the world mark massaro  canaccord genuity inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tycho peterson with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead tycho w peterson  jpmorgan securities llc hey thanks john you talked about winning a high throughput account in the headtohead with cancer can you maybe talk on just pricing dynamics for ctng i mean as you compete on more of these high throughput deals how should we think about pricing trends and then similarly with viral load you expect a similar level of takeoff activity if that market heats up a bit john l bishop  chairman  chief executive officer so yeah as weve indicated and frankly that was one of the key items that we included when we reset our guidance on the gross margins to  to  that was part of the – big part of the mix that we were looking at there wasnt just a question of mix with hbdc but as weve really been growing in success in sexual health and recognizing that the asps are going to be less there those are already factored into the – the mix we did put in the same thing and to answer your question specifically yeah we see prices coming down on virology certainly thats come down and weve seen some significant drops in the emerging markets in that regard the one big difference were not necessarily going to go and dont need to go fully headtohead on pricing with the ultralow prices in the emerging markets because those are centralized testing and the big thing were going to take there is take advantage of our – both our existing and the omni and go after the disseminated market which if – if they were to continue only with centralized testing be impossible for them to meet the goals that have been stated for those markets on patient management and treatment so i expect those are going to grow very nicely and we will be taking those at a higher price point so yes in summary the price points on these items are in fact stepping down we have considered all of that – all of thats factored into our guidance the good news there is our enzyme program is absolutely on track and were successfully going to be rolling that product out so were well prepared to be able to compete in those markets and frankly the other good news that im particularly enthusiastic about is that were getting recognition on our systems that our systems can in fact do a good job and as the chernesky paper showed ive long said that the infinity is the most efficient highest volume system on the market and that study really reflected that realization operator thank you our last and final question comes from the line of vijay kumar with evercore isi your line is open please go ahead vijay kumar  evercore group llc hey guys thanks for taking my question so maybe just a clarification question john i think you mentioned – you called out the sequential sort of q revenue ramping higher than the past two years and then just wondering if you could comment on the drivers q versus q and whats changing because if i look at your gross margin commentary in a mix driving q margins below q it feels like most of the hbdc shipment to india thats probably going to fall in q is that – is that the right way to think about the sequential ramp thank you daniel madden  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah vijay this is dan just to clarify so what we said was if you look at the last couple of years for example youll see that historically weve had a stepdown from q to q and this quarter this coming quarter q we are expecting a sequential stepup hbdc is certainly a part of that i mean we are expecting a meaningful contribution from hbdc in the second half its not just the india reagents we do expect the india reagents to be a driver in the second half overall some of that maybe q but as weve talked about before timing with india is always a little bit uncertain but overall we do expect a higher contribution from hbdc in the third quarter which is of course driving our guide there if you will that gross margins will be sequentially down a little bit operator thank you that does conclude todays qa session and i would like to turn the conference back over to ms jacquie ross for any closing

hamil harris and and emma brown by hamil harris and and emma brown may   bishop john l meares a white memphis faith healer who came to washington more than half a century ago and started what is now evangel cathedral one of the region’s largest black congregations died may  at his home in upper marlboro he was  and had congestive heart failure bishop meares first preached in the district in the summer of  when he held a tent revival meeting in what became a parking lot for rfk stadium from those early roots his everexpanding evangelical congregation migrated to a converted horse stable a renovated movie theater and finally in  to a  million sanctuary in suburban upper marlboro over the years the member church has drawn attention for putting on lavish broadwaystyle musical productions and for drawing highprofile evangelists — including td jakes oral roberts and charles blake — to its pulpit and annual conference of pastors but evangel cathedral is perhaps most known as a sundaymorning anomaly an african american congregation led by a white son of the south bishop meares said he was called to the nation’s capital in part to heal its racial tensions to many of his followers he made strides toward bridging the rift that has so deeply divided black and white washington “he didn’t preach on race or racism — he preached jesus black and white worshipped together freely” said bishop alfred owens pastor of greater mount calvary holy church in the district who said he converted to christianity at  in bishop meares’s church “the color line was washed away” evangel cathedral was dogged however by allegations that its white leaders — including bishop meares and his two pastor sons virgil and donald — funded its multimilliondollar expansion on the backs of lowincome innercity black congregants in the early s the church moved from the york theater in northwest washington to a newly constructed  million seat sanctuary in northeast about that time a black activist group marched into a sunday service at the church and spoke out against religious organizations that “steal from the poor” in the s as the church scouted for a new location in prince george’s county former followers of bishop meares’s alleged that he and his sons had ordered congregants to tithe  each or risk a curse from god further details emerged in  when nine former followers filed a lawsuit against the meares family alleging fraud and emotional abuse told to sacrifice for god the congregants had mortgaged their homes signed over childsupport checks and maxed out credit cards — all in an effort to help the church pay for its new home at the ensuing trial plaintiffs played taped recordings of bishop meares’s exhortations to give “the lord has said in five months this people would give  million” he said during a sunday service a dc superior court judge dismissed the case telling plaintiffs that their evidence “won my heart but not my head” however aggressive the meareses’ techniques the judge said the family’s fundraising did not constitute fraud bishop meares maintained that he had only expressed god’s wishes “giving is an act of worship” he told the washington post in  “we are not here to bend anybody’s will” that year the church bought a  home for bishop meares and his wife the church also paid  million cash for more than  acres in prince george’s which became the site of its new building bishop meares installed his son donald as senior pastor in  and the younger meares continues to lead the church donald meares said the church has thrived because of smart business decisions such as using some of its acreage to build housing developments “we are here today because of sound management” he said john levin meares was born jan   in largo fla at  he enrolled at the church of god bible school in sevierville tenn where he met a fellow student whom he later married besides his wife of  years mary lee bell meares of upper marlboro survivors include three children donald meares virgil meares and cynthia meares all of upper marlboro six grandchildren and three greatgrandchildren bishop meares was ordained in the church of god in  and received a bachelor’s degree from the university of tennessee four years later he also received a doctor of divinity degree from oral roberts university in tulsa okla he started church of god congregations in athens tenn and memphis before he was invited to preach at a revival in washington by evangelist jack coe the revival drew thousands of black washingtonians who gathered in the summer’s wet heat for ecstatic celebrations of prayer and healing when bishop meares decided to stay in the city the church he started gained a reputation as a center for seemingly impossible phenomena “i would watch the miracles of the crippled and blind as they were prayed for” bishop meares’s son virgil once wrote “and i knew as a child that god was for real i especially liked it when someone would have one leg shorter than the other and as prayer was offered the leg would become the length of the other one” bishop meares was expelled from the predominantly white church of god in  for what church leaders said was insubordination he maintained that he was pushed out because he had dared to preach to black folks the church dwindled in the aftermath of the  riots that followed martin luther king jr’s assassination but then roared back to life in the early s as bishop meares created a christian training institute that offered selfhelp courses counseling bible study and academic classes in the s and ’s bishop meares served on an international committee that sought to build bridges between pentecostal and roman catholic leaders he traveled widely expanding his church’s missionary programs with the help of the international evangelical and missionary association a fellowship of hundreds of pentecostal churches consecrated as a bishop in  he often described the church he created in washington as a spiritual garden an innercity refuge “god is a creative god” he once told the post “when he breathes upon us we become creative” comments  share on facebookshare   share on twittertweet share via
