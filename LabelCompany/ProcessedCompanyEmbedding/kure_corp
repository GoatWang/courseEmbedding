facebook google  press releases kure corp weighs in on fda vaping regulations franchise leader confident about future of vaping industry may   pm edt charlotte nc may   prnewswire  kure corp one of the nations fastest growing retail brands in the vaping industry responded today to the us food and drug administration deeming of electronic cigarettes and vape products as tobacco products kure corps chairman of the board martin a sumichrast said in a statement today kure corp anticipated this outcome and we have been building our business the right way in anticipation of these events the fda regulations such as id verification and childproof safety caps have always been a standard business practice at kure we are confident that our products will stand up to regulatory and legal scrutiny and have every intention of working with fda as well as the federal legislative and judicial branches to maintain our products on the market in compliance with federal and state law we feel confident that we can meet the technical aspects of the regulations including the good manufacturing requirements to which we will be subject we expect that most of our hardware and other products will fall outside the jurisdiction under which fda regulates tobacco products with respect to our products not excluded from the fdas jurisdiction we expect the fda to lay out a pathway toward implementation which will give companies like kure an opportunity to work on the steps needed to maintain compliance with the fdas new rules we believe for the fda to fully establish their regulatory framework especially on the paperwork and clinical data requirements it will take significantly more than the two year grace period…maybe even as long as a decade during this period we expect to continue to work with fda and continue to sell wellmanufactured products that comply with other reasonable state and federal guidelines ultimately we believe that a transparent and predictable set of regulatory rules is going to improve the consistency quality and safety of the products sold to our consumers and will enhance our business model we are confident that both the judiciary and legislature will ultimately weigh in on these regulations that have been named the cigarette protection act we remain in discussions with experts in washington who will be assisting us with this fda process so that we stay ready to engage the fda at the appropriate time to continue to advance our business about kure franchise llc and kure corp kuresocietycom and kurefranchisecomkure franchise llc
