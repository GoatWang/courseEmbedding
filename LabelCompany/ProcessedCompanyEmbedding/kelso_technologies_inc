inc began as a mining equipment supplier in march   over time the focus of the company moved into the railway equipment supply industry  by  kelsos new vp of engineering barry lacroix had developed a pressure relief valve for the north american rail tank car market for which kelso would act as the distributor  the company was a small player that failed to gain sales traction with the pressure relief valve that received regulatory approval and became available for sale in   after the us economy shrank in late  and throughout  kelso struggled financially  in april  the board of directors brought in a business developer james r bond and other key management to begin the rebuilding process  with a newly patented manway technology to offer in addition to the pressure relief valves the company began the regulatory approval process for the manway and commenced the marketing of their safer technology for the transport of hazardous goods to the rail tank car industry privacy policy

completed initial commercial testing of its new emergency response kit known as the kelso erk erk this specialized equipment is used by first responders to cap and contain chemical leaks in the field that originate in a hazmat rail tank cars valve assembly or its connections located on the top of the tank car the erk is specifically designed to be implemented quickly and safely to reduce potential dangers to human life and environmental harm to communities during emergency events involving hazardous materials  the erk was developed in partnership with hazardous materials specialists from a

used the erk takes up less space on emergency response vehicles and allows handling by one person built with lightweight materials  the erk is half the weight of existing products providing easier deployment and operation of the erk by emergency responders no additional application tools are required which reduces kit weight and complexity of operation colorcoded valve caps aid first responder

gas and anhydrous ammonia and nonpressurized tank cars  the kelso erk is the only emergency kit in the market that is designed to handle general service tank cars the erk meets the design requirements

responders in north america james r bond ceo of the company comments that the erk represents a new diverse multimillion dollar market for the company kelso has completed all required design specifications in collaboration with our class  railroad partner and is now prepared to begin distribution of the erk to first responder organizations we are proud of the new benefits engineered into
