public service board of san antonio and city of austin texas own respectively  percent and  percent of stp units  and  but are not involved in the proposed merger in addition to nrg south texas  percent undivided ownership interest in stp units  and  nrg south texas holds a corresponding interest in stp nuclear operating company stpnoc a notforprofit texas corporation which is the licensed operator of stp units  and  thus the indirect transfer of control of nrg south texas would also result in the indirect transfer of control of this interest in stpnoc the applicants state that this is not a controlling interest in stpnoc and therefore there will be no indirect transfer of stpnocs licenses to operate on behalf of the owners the applicants indicate that if the nrc concludes that indirect transfer of control of nrg south texas interest in stpnoc requires prior nrc consent it requests such consent no physical changes to stp units  and  or operational changes are being proposed in the application pursuant to  cfr  no license or any right thereunder shall be transferred directly or indirectly through transfer of control of the licenses unless the commission shall give its consent in writing the commission will approve an application for the indirect transfer of a license if the commission determines that the proposed transaction effecting the indirect transfer will not affect the qualifications of the licensee to hold the license and that the transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law regulations and orders issued by the commission pursuant thereto in this instance exelon asserts that the proposed indirect transfer will not result in any change in the licensees financial qualifications or operating organization the commission is
