information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the sec which are on our website also on the last page of the earnings release you will find a reconciliation between gaap and nongaap measures with that i would like to turn the call over to terry terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks john and thank you all for joining us this morning im going to make some initial comments and then ill turn it over to john who will share the financial highlights our overall volumes remained high during the first quarter even though there were pockets of low volatility in equity and energy markets we delivered record average daily volume of more than  million contracts this includes alltime highs in interest rates and metals average daily volume activity from outside the united states remained strong the volume averaged more than  million contracts per day within fixed income we had broadbased strength across eurodollars treasuries and fed fund futures during q this has been driven by recent outsized growth from our buyside customers we continue to see strong performance in our treasury futures relative to the cash treasuries market our metals portfolio which was our fastestgrowing asset class in the first quarter delivered outstanding activity with more than  contracts traded per day driven by growth in both precious and base metals our performance in copper was particularly impressive with  growth to almost  contracts per day during the quarter even more impressive considering that our primary competitor in copper saw their business decline  in that same timeframe we continued to gain traction with our options business here we have taken an enterprisewide approach by enhancing our technology better equipping our sales force to engage with clients and launching some innovative new products last year we generated a combined  million of transaction revenue in options this makes us the worlds largest options exchange by that measure during q we reached a record average daily volume in both interest rate and equity options in march our eurodollar options average daily volume grew  to  million contracts per day of that  was electronic the highest monthly percentage yet and the april electronic percentage todate is even higher and in natural gas options we grew our daily volumes  during the quarter  of which traded electronically helping us to achieve a market share of  in march new products and product extensions continued to perform well our ultra year treasury futures and options exceeded  contracts per day in q this was nearly triple the activity from a year ago we launched monthly fx futures recently and have had some early success there in metals we saw record volumes and open interest in our suite of aluminum premium products which we launched last year confirming global demand for these innovative risk management tools in equities we have seen some traction in our sp select sector futures in early april we launched weekly emini sp  monday options on the first exploration we traded over  contracts during that day alone additionally the emini sp wednesday weekly options we launched in september  have achieved   contracts per day in  so far combined the monday and wednesdays are recently producing more than  of our total equity options trading we think these short data products are very appealing and valuable to customers especially given the geopolitical concerns and an uncertainty around european elections i mentioned last quarter that we are heavily focused on expanding our customer base by focusing on end user customers our main objective is to identify potential clients that may be using less efficient products and convert them to cme group offerings we are making progress for example we have record open interest our large open interest holders in three key areas one is in our interest rate business where we achieved an open interest record of over  million contracts including records in eurodollar futures treasury futures fed fund futures driven in large part by asset manager the other is in our energy futures business where we achieved new record levels of open interest during q in our wti gasoline and heating oil futures additionally we hit an approximate fouryear high in natural gas futures open interest and grew our adv by  while our competition shrunk  allowing us to increase our yeartodate market share to  versus  in march of  while our trading in fx was down during the quarter we significantly outperformed the two primary competitive venues and we are pleased to reach a record level of large open interest holders toward the end of february more important we saw banks reappear as our fastestgrowing segment during the quarter in fx the other thing we are focused on is operational efficiency we continue to ensure that we are allocating our time and resources in the best way possible a few weeks ago we announced that we will be closing our european exchange and clearinghouse by yearend our customers have clearly shown that they prefer to use our us infrastructure to access our global products deep liquidity and capital efficiency we will maintain a significant operation based in london however it will be focused on direct sales of our core products while there are several positive trends in our business one area i wanted to briefly touch on is market data we outlined an ambitious plan last quarter to supplement our traditional realtime data business with several new data offerings we referenced increasing the data sales team focused on derived data offering a new cloudbased data platform along with building out an audit function rather than outsourcing it we are currently augmenting our organization to capture these opportunities frankly we underestimated the complexity of resourcing our team which will not allow us to achieve the guidance we previously outlined therefore we do not expect these initiatives to drive any incremental data revenue for this year lastly our april trading volume has remained strong during what is usually a slower time of the year volume is averaging approximately  million contracts per day and we are seeing  growth month to date we intend to build on our strong momentum by providing outstanding value to our customers in closing id like to thank our employees for all of their hard work this quarter with that let me hand it over to john john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thank you terry and good morning everyone we are very pleased to start off the year with a strong quarter our team continues to be intensely focused on driving global revenue growth operating our business as efficiently as possible and returning excess capital to our shareholders we had an exceptional quarter as we did in the first quarter of last year as terry mentioned we had the highest quarterly adv in our history and we also had record net income and earnings per share on an adjusted basis our overall rate per contract for the first quarter was  the same level we had the prior quarter despite an almost  product mix shift toward our lower priced interest rate products market data came in at  million down from q as several larger customers consolidated trading operations and their terminal usage moving to expenses excluding license fees and adjustments our first quarter total expense was approximately  million in line with our original guidance earlier this month we announced our intention to wind down a portion of our european operations by yearend we expect the annual savings to be between  million and  million which will primarily impact  as it will take us some time to fully complete the process eventually we also expect to free up over  million in capital related to these entities additionally because of the transfer of the russell products in july as well as aggregate changes in our licenses we would expect our license fees in the second half of this year to increase  to  versus the same period last year assuming similar trading patterns our adjusted compensation expense increased by  primarily driven by normal cost of living increases as well as hiring additional technology staff in india and belfast which over time we expect will reduce higher cost professional fees our compensation ratio in q was  about the same level as we had for the full year of  looking at the nonoperating income and expense line for the first quarter our ownership in the sp dow jones indices joint venture primarily drove the  million in net earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries this was the highest quarter we have seen and up  from q last year the compound annual growth rate on this contribution has been  since  our returns from investing cash on behalf of our customers increased sequentially to  million from  million in q considering current cash positions we expect the investment returns to increase again in q as we will have the first full quarter impact of cme clearings approval to hold customer cash performance bond deposits in a federal reserve bank account the tax rate in the first quarter was an adjusted  we expect the rate to be higher in the second quarter and we expect an effective rate of  for the full year and now to the balance sheet at the end of the first quarter we had approximately  billion in cash and marketable securities which includes  million of cash from our final bmfbovespa stock sale in january its worth noting we also returned  billion in january through our annual variable dividend and approximately  million in march through our regular quarterly dividend finally during the first quarter capital expenditures net of leasehold improvement allowances were  million in summary its been a great start to the year we reached a peak level of volume adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share we intend to remain very focused on efficiency coupled with enhancing the value proposition of using our markets to attract new customers with that wed like to open up the call for your questions thank you questionandanswer session operator thank you sir well take our first question from rich repetto with sandler oneill richard henry repetto  sandler oneill  partners lp yeah good morning terry good morning john terrence a duffy  cme group inc good morning rich john w pietrowicz  cme group inc good morning rich richard henry repetto  sandler oneill  partners lp i guess the question is on the market data terry because just trying to – so are you saying it was the guidance  to  up and is the new guidance more flat for  and could you give us a little bit more detail about the resourcing that you talk about that you need to augment terrence a duffy  cme group inc yeah i think rich im going to let john discuss that a little bit and then im going to have bryan walk through some of the resources that i outlined in my opening remarks and i think youll get a little bit more color on that so hopefully we can answer your question if not go ahead and follow up with it john w pietrowicz  cme group inc yeah thanks rich this is john yeah as we indicated in the prepared remarks the opportunity associated with some of the items we outlined in the fourth quarter call are being pushed out into  from  i would say that the market data for this year is going to be rangebound and well be able to provide some more color as we get closer to launching the opportunity in  terrence a duffy  cme group inc so bryan why dont you give a little color on the folks that were looking to step up on bryan t durkin  cme group inc yeah thanks terry quite frankly rich we underestimated the level of time it would take us to get the staffing in place particularly to help us with the opportunities associated with derived data i think youve heard us speak quite a bit about where we see those opportunities and we have much in our pipeline that were getting through right now but it is very labor intensive and a very specialized source of talent that were looking for to help us navigate through and capture those opportunities same thing with the audits we are working right now aggressively on augmenting our capabilities with some – bringing in some outsourcing staff to help us as we ramp up our staffing for the auditing function and then id say lastly in terms of the development of our business intelligence efforts which will allow us to capture some of the other opportunities that ive outlined in the past the highly specialized skills that were looking for right now and quite frankly we were very aggressive in terms of what we thought our ability was going to be to get that staffing in place terrence a duffy  cme group inc and let me just add a little bit to what bryan said rich we first came out with historical and derived data and new opportunities to capture revenue i think frankly we might have even underestimated the value of some of this market data and i think in order for us to roll this out properly to the benefit not only of our shareholders but the users who want to have this we need to make sure we price it adequately properly and distribute it adequately and properly through the direct channels and give bryan the resources with his team to move it forward so to me i know it can look like somewhat of a negative on the guidance but overall we are very committed to the strategy and were looking forward to delivering on this richard henry repetto  sandler oneill  partners lp understood and then one quick followup john you said that the interest would likely increase from the – i believe its the fed deposit program in q can you give us a little bit of feel on how much that might be john w pietrowicz  cme group inc yeah sure i think were really pleased with being able to offer this opportunity to our customers if you recall the access to the fed account for customers was kind of middle of march is when it became available so if you look at the next quarter assuming that the same balance mix and the same level of balances as the end of q which weve seen remain steady through april  of this month so we should have at around  million to  million additional dollars in q assuming those balances and mix remain constant richard henry repetto  sandler oneill  partners lp got it okay thank you very much terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks thanks rich appreciate it operator well go next to dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon  jefferies llc thanks good morning terrence a duffy  cme group inc good morning dan daniel t fannon  jefferies llc i guess my question is a little bit more broader on market data you guys have raised prices last year and implemented pricing or cost on things youre giving away for free now youre looking to roll out enhanced components of the data i guess generally how are your customers feeling about paying more for these services and the longer term opportunity you think in market data as a revenue are you still as bullish about it or think it can be a growth area for you on a longer term basis terrence a duffy  cme group inc let me start a little bit then i might turn it over to bryan dan its terry yes we are bullish on market data you got to realize we are coming off of a zero basis we gave this away for many years to attract liquidity which was critically important to the future of this company so then we are still a lowcost provider as it relates to our competitors as it relates to market data so with our new offerings this is not just the core business of trying to charge them more for our core offerings this is new derived – new offerings in data and as i said earlier in my comments i think its important for us to understand what that true value of that data is by putting the analytics team in place the sales team in place globally so we can distribute that and capture the revenue thats appropriate so were not willynilly changing the pricing on historical and derived data constantly so i think this is a process that as i said in my comments we may have underestimated a little bit how its going to take to roll it out but i do think i would say we were still very bullish on it ill let bryan comment more bryan t durkin  cme group inc and to add onto terry were taking a longer term focus on this bear in mind we have the broadest array of asset classes six asset classes that we represent and i would argue the largest customer base and so were taking a very holistic global picture and making sure that that resourcing and capturing those opportunities across the globe that were best positioned its taking us a little longer to get there terrence a duffy  cme group inc answer your question dan daniel t fannon  jefferies llc yeah thanks very much thanks all terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks dan operator well go next to alex kramm with ubs alex kramm  ubs securities llc yeah hey good morning terrence a duffy  cme group inc good morning alex alex kramm  ubs securities llc good morning sorry to ask another question about market data but i think you talked a lot about the outlook for kind of like the new stuff youre excited about but can you just give us a little bit more color in terms of what happened in the first quarter i think john gave a couple of items here but if you just think about it holistically right your volumes are going up people are more interested in your markets they should be new people new firms consuming your data so why was that down quarteroverquarter and then related to this i mean you gave a pretty bullish statement in february youve been to a couple of industrial conferences and you saw a lot of us in boca in midmarch it seems like very surprising that that first quarter came in so light so what happened there why was there not more visibility that you could have communicated thanks terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks thanks alex yeah our market data revenue for the quarter was  million what did happen was there was several larger customers that were doing some internal efficiencies themselves and also consolidated their screens which caused the first quarter to come in lighter than we had anticipated going into the first quarter alex kramm  ubs securities llc and you didnt notice that until now i mean im just surprised how long it took for you guys to realize that sorry to harp on it terrence a duffy  cme group inc no no thats fine i mean if you recall the way this is done is were about a month in arrears as we go through and they submit the counts to us so we dont have clarity on that until part of the way through the quarter so thats fundamentally why its something thats recorded in arrears alex kramm  ubs securities llc all right fair enough thank you terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you thanks alex john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thanks alex operator well go to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc great thanks sorry to stay in the market data subject but just in terms of the – i guess as we move through  i appreciate you mentioned rangebound did you view the consolidation of some of those screens from some of those customers thats sort of a onetime event or do you see the potential for that happening again during the year and then maybe just talk about the transition process of moving to the new data platform i appreciate it can take a while but is there any kind of friction as you do that or do you feel that will be a seamless handoff terrence a duffy  cme group inc so brian let me kick it over to bryan for a second then ill make some comments when hes finished on the first part of your question bryan bryan t durkin  cme group inc its hard for us to estimate in terms of how firms might change some of their dynamics or usage but in positioning ourselves for any changes in that direction its incumbent upon us to take the rich vibrant database that we have and develop the new products that weve outlined to you i think its fair to say that we represented those new initiatives relatively recently and we are staffing ourselves to be able to capture those opportunities so its not necessarily the same consumer of information or data that were going after either you have to separate the core from the derived and the historical all of these represent different opportunities and consumers of that data terrence a duffy  cme group inc you know brian let me just add to what bryan said a little bit and talk about what do we see going down the road one of the things weve said since we took this company public in  and weve always said its like volumes volumes are very difficult to predict right because were beholden to a whole host of different activities geopolitical including that and policies associated around the world so when you look at the growth of our business on the volume side were doing everything we can to create capital efficiencies bringing new markets new people that were not participants into our marketplace which alex referred to earlier in his comments and go back to that were going to continue to address new clients the big focus of mine and the management team to bring in new clients and the longer we can continue to work hard to bring in new clients that will then take care of the market data equation so its something i like to say i cant control the price of the stock what i can control is trying to help run the business as efficiently as possible bring in new clients to create capital efficiencies  and i think that will have a major reflection across the entire portfolio of our businesses including market data brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc and so we should view the market data as fairly core – the current market data stream is fairly core and then the initiatives that youre working as incremental to the core because  terrence a duffy  cme group inc right yes yes absolutely bryan t durkin  cme group inc yes absolutely correct brian bedell  deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thanks brian operator excuse me well go next to michael carrier with bank of america merrill lynch michael roger carrier  bank of america merrill lynch thanks guys john maybe just on the fed account just wanted to get a sense where maybe the imbalances are dealers clients and then what maybe the potential longer term opportunity and what kind of the puts and takes are as users are trying to determine where to put their balances and then just real quick on the european thing it sounds like expenses thats more  the cash thats there is that also most likely going to be  or would that be a  event thanks john w pietrowicz  cme group inc sure thanks thanks mike yeah lets talk a little bit about the fed account as of quarter end we had about  billion in performance bonds and guarantee funds on our balance sheet of that  billion was at the fed  billion of the  billion were house accounts and  billion was customerrelated accounts at the fed as a reminder the fed itself – the customer cash came in about midway through march so we didnt have a full quarter impact of having that available to our customers what we have seen unlike in past quarters is that the amount thats being held at the fed has remained constant and steady through the month of april so thats why were mentioning that assuming that the mix and the level stay constant as of end of q we should see an increase of  million to  million more in q in terms of how customers will look at putting money at the fed ill ask sunil to comment on it he is here as well and he is president of our clearinghouse the customers will do a calculation in terms of number one do they need the cash readily number two what the return is that they can get at the fed versus other instruments they could hold in terms of collateral so sunil sunil cutinho  cme group inc thank you john just to add to what john is saying we actually provide a very flexible collateral program to our clearing firms to actually post either cash or securities to meet their margin requirements and as john pointed out one of the factors may be the return that they can get on their cash balances but that is not the only factor john w pietrowicz  cme group inc and then in terms of your question regarding the things that were doing in europe the amount of capital that were able to free up which is around  million well be able to free that up once those enterprises are wound down and so that would be a late  early  point when we can get the cash back here to the states michael roger carrier  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks a lot terrence a duffy  cme group inc all right thanks mike john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thank you operator well go to chris allen with buckingham research chris allen  the buckingham research group inc good morning guys terrence a duffy  cme group inc good morning chris john w pietrowicz  cme group inc good morning chris chris allen  the buckingham research group inc i just wanted to maybe touch a little bit on rate per contract it was fairly resilient across most products in the quarter and a little bit surprising with the volume trends im guessing its maybe due to continued electronic adoption of options trading and continued penetration of customer bases but any more granularity you can give us there would be helpful terrence a duffy  cme group inc sure chris in terms of the rpc yeah it was pretty resilient at  the realized benefits of our pricing actions plus lower volume discounts in equities and energy were able to offset that mix shift – it was a  percentage point mix shift to our lower priced interest rate products ill turn it over to sean and he can talk too a little bit about the options sean tully  cme group inc sure in terms of the innovation that weve done over the last few years a lot of these new products that weve launched actually have a much higher rpc for example as terry mentioned earlier were very focused on delivering the most capital margin and total costefficient products possible so our invoice spreads which take advantage of portfolio margining between cme cleared interest rate swaps and cme treasury futures for example they traded  billion a day over  contracts in the first quarter a record number up  year over year so huge growth now while in our treasury complex  plus contracts a day may not seem very high the rpc is about  so its approximately four times the rpc of our overall complex in addition to that if you look at our basis trade at index close for example in equities basis trade at index close remember we launched a little over a year ago this allows participants to trade our equity futures at a basis to the cash market close very efficient for cash options traders but also very efficient for index managers wanting to eliminate any slippage relative to the management of their index funds the btic we actually had a record day on february  we had another record day on march  the btic likewise has an extremely high rpc of approximately  and doing about  contracts a day so weve had id say an extremely high hit ratio on our recent successes and a lot of those new products with the efficiencies that they provide have a higher rpc terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks sean maybe derek can comment a little bit on his process as well derek l sammann  cme group inc yeah chris and as terry mentioned at the top of his comments we had an alltime record quarter in our metals business as you know our metals contracts is our highest rpc contract and copper has been a particular area of strength you couple that with the large open interest holders and open interest records were having coupled with the fact that energy and metals particularly is where weve seen our highest participation and fastest growth in the commercial participants youve got a combination of highrpc products and growth in our highrpc customer bases within those products as well so were helping to grow and diversify the growth across the exchange chris allen  the buckingham research group inc great thanks and just a quick one just on the guidance for the licensing fees up in the back half of the year when do the escalators kick in i wouldve imagined it was earlier in the year and what does that assume for russell adv the similar levels that were seeing on ice right now terrence a duffy  cme group inc what i guided to was to kind of give you a perspective of when you take a look at the second half of last year compared to the second half – what were expecting the second half of this year its a  to  increase and that is assuming similar trading patterns its not only the russell but also other changes that occur in our license fees many of them youre right started at the start of this year in terms of the level for the russell were not kind of guiding in terms of the amount of volume i will say that were very excited about bringing the russell on the efficiencies that we can provide our customers and the distribution that we can provide our customers is really second to none so sean do you want to comment on the russell sean tully  cme group inc yeah were very excited about the launch of the russell  so when were launching those contrasts were going to be launching both the futures and a full suite of options on july  we are very excited about that there will however be a oneyear period when those contracts are trading both on our platform and on our competitors platform so there is some level of uncertainty as to when participants will move their open interest from one exchange the other we are working very closely with market were very excited about it and were doing everything possible in order to make the transfer of open interest as easy as possible as low cost as possible as minimum slip as possible for our participants and so were excited about it but it will take some time in order to move the open interest terrence a duffy  cme group inc yeah to give you some perspective the last full year that we had the russell was in  when we were trading  contracts a day in  at the alternative platform where russell is currently trading it was  contracts a day so over that same period of time it got cut in half and then also just so you know that they cut the contract notional in half early this year or late last year sean tully  cme group inc late last year terrence a duffy  cme group inc late last year chris allen  the buckingham research group inc great thanks a lot guys terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks chris john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thanks operator well go to ken worthington with jpmorgan kenneth b worthington  jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning thank you for taking my questions so followup on the fed i assume that the customer ultimately makes the decision on where customer cash is placed so maybe what percent of customer cash do you think will be placed with the fed over time and maybe as the interest rate environment normalizes would you expect the utilization of the fed window to kind of increase or decrease and then lastly cme is taking a cut of that yield and maybe to what extent are you getting pushback on the fees or the take that cme is getting on that fed yield and is there any reason for pushback to kind of increase or decrease there over time terrence a duffy  cme group inc so ken let me kick it over to sunil to tell you the mechanism how clients make a decision and how they want to have their funds being held and where so sunil why dont you go ahead and ill address the other part of our costs that are associated with the equities and how we are just recapturing some of our cost on the back end of it sunil cutinho  cme group inc thank you terry as we said before we provide our clearing firms the flexibility to post cash or securities when cash is posted to us we actually – cash for margin requirements is posted to us we actually place that with fed accounts and we pass the return back to the clients terrence a duffy  cme group inc and as far as what we capture as relates to the fed accounts i am going to let john walk through some of the costs that we incur and what we get back to offset those john w pietrowicz  cme group inc yeah thanks ken what weve been doing over the last several years is providing our customers number one access to the fed that they dont have presently and then secondly we do incur a substantial amount of fees to support the clearing operations liquidity fees bank fees other types of fees this helps to offset so its two things one is giving our customers that availability number two is to recoup some of the costs which are not insubstantial for running our business terrence a duffy  cme group inc answered your question ken kenneth b worthington  jpmorgan securities llc yeah and just the last part of it so in the interest rate environment when interest rates – before interest rates rose you get a nice premium at the fed versus what you get in the open market i assume that may change as interest rates go higher is there less of an incentive to actually go to the fed window as rates rise terrence a duffy  cme group inc you know what ken i think thats pure speculation on what the  having margin that cme group will do we have no idea what theyre going to do i mean some people want to hold securities some people want to hold cash that could change dramatically on a rising rate environment it may not – its a waitandsee program for us so we dont want to speculate on that kenneth b worthington  jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you and then last maybe terry for you cme has made a push to further rationalize its business youve exited some noncore businesses which appeared to be really helping to boost efficiency european clearing being good example to what extent is there more a lowhanging fruit in terms of rationalizing the business terrence a duffy  cme group inc i dont know if theres any lowhanging fruit i dont know what were doing in europe is considered lowhanging fruit but were making some tough decisions about how we optimize this business and were going to continue to do so i mentioned earlier in my comments that its about the client and im not saying a client in the united states is a client globally so we are really focusing on going out attracting new end users into our products and showing the benefits that they can derive by doing the risk management here at cme group its all about cost efficiencies in the world that we live in today sean talked about it a little bit earlier and were going to continue to point out those cost efficiencies which cme group can offer to its clients so thats a big push that we have over the next  months and we think were very hopeful that well pay major dividends for not only our shareholders but the opportunities for our clients kenneth b worthington  jpmorgan securities llc thank you very much terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thanks operator we go to warren gardiner with evercore warren gardiner  evercore group llc great thanks good morning guys terrence a duffy  cme group inc good morning warren warren gardiner  evercore group llc maybe i missed it but it sounded like the database was going to require some further investment beyond what you guys were expecting but it doesnt look like there was really much change to expense guidance or anything along those lines can you kind of just square those two for us john w pietrowicz  cme group inc yeah sure warren this is john as terry has kind of mentioned its really about focusing the resources within cme group and some of the things that we talked about as we rationalized some of the operations here were able to take some of those resources and put them towards growth initiatives this is an example of that we feel that in data theres a tremendous opportunity with our six asset classes and the value of the options data that we have within our business and weve got a large and growing options complex so its really taking internal resources and reprioritizing them to the market data efforts theres lots of examples that i can give you on that but its really taking the focus of the business and putting it towards market data also as terry has indicated we spent a lot of time growing this in a global client base driving this accumulating all this volume and now were really focused on capturing the market data side of the opportunity for us terrence a duffy  cme group inc and just to add to what john said im very – what john and rest of the team were very focused on the cost of running this business most efficiently possible so i dont see any incremental cost to adding to bryans group to go out and capture the revenue opportunities that we believe are in market data so i dont see any reason to guide on any higher expenses as it relates to that product line warren gardiner  evercore group llc okay great thank you terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you operator well go next to patrick oshaughnessy with raymond james patrick j oshaughnessy  raymond james  associates inc hey good morning terrence a duffy  cme group inc good morning patrick patrick j oshaughnessy  raymond james  associates inc quick question on energy so ice and platts announced that in may theyre going to launch a us lng futures contract is that an area within energy that you think presents an opportunity for cme group as well derek l sammann  cme group inc yeah thanks patrick its derek sorry for my froggy voice i picked up something in china last week when you look at the energy business as terry mentioned in some of his remarks were coming off a year or a quarter this year of record open interest in growth in wti heating oil gasoline and nat gas when you look at lng its a growing market its an emerging asset class where youre talking about a product that is now the result of whats changing both in the dynamics here in the us as well as a global market its a physical market that is evolving theres no established price points right now when you look at the position that we got in the henry hub market in natural gas were at record levels of  market share terry referenced our outperformance growth versus ice in nat gas options and nat gas so yeah were looking at that as an additional piece of the growth pie relative to energy were very excited about that we think the growth weve put up and given the fact that we are now seeing commercials as the single largest participant in our energy business that coupled with the large open interest orders and open interest rates give an indication as to where were focused on the end user need so as the lng market evolves were working with end users to make sure were able to service them in lng market as we have in wti as well as in the nat gas market if you look at slide  in the deck that we sent you youll see the growth in open interest that weve actually been put up across each of these four major components on energy business so in the same way that we have attacked those client segments and be able to serve their needs well do the same thing in emerging products like lng patrick j oshaughnessy  raymond james  associates inc got it i appreciate that and then speaking of your slide deck as we look at slide  and showing your growth in europe and asia it does look like that growth slowed a little bit i guess in the first quarter of  versus  so from that i infer that most of your volume growth in the march quarter came from us clients and i think you made some commentary about banks kind of getting more active so if you can maybe expound on that a little bit terrence a duffy  cme group inc yeah ill let bryan and sean touch on that a little bit about the expansion throughout the other regions bryan bryan t durkin  cme group inc sure thank you terry so our global business remains very strong and robust youre correct that id say early on january february was somewhat muted in comparison to the prior year however as we look into march weve seen a tremendous growth particularly in our rates jumped  from march of last year which is a tremendous sign and our european activity overall was up substantially in comparison to the us again it goes to the diversity of the product line because even as we saw some slowing down in the interest rate and equity complexes in january and february that was well offset by our activities in our ags metals and our fx complex so again it goes to the diversity of the product line and the very surgical approach that were taking to developing new client opportunities and bringing in new clients and the development of products that sean has outlined terrence a duffy  cme group inc sean maybe you could touch a little bit about the european interest rates versus ours and where you saw that in the first quarter sean tully  cme group inc sure in terms of european interest rates – actually in terms of our us rates complex i think we mentioned it clearly in the documents but record number of large open interest holders record open interest record q volumes so were very excited about what we were able to achieve in the first quarter and terry mentioned in terms of innovation our ultra year reaching  contracts a day so were very excited about what weve done there in terms of our european penetration specifically in our interest rate products to put things into perspective we did  million contracts a day out of europe so we did almost  million contracts a day think about that relative to the size of our competitors and they are global actually businesses so weve gotten extremely high penetration were going to continue to get increased penetration if you look on our charts – on slide  you can see here how we had great actually traction in our eurodollar futures and options our treasury futures and options we had over  growth in our fed funds contracts and we continue to increase penetration of the cash market so were very excited about our rates market then actually on slide – you can see our innovation on slide  where were looking at several new innovations that weve launched in the marketplace and the terrific traction that were getting there you can see on slide  for example the record number of large open interest holders where weve had a new leg up in that marketplace in terms of banks and the growth that were seeing in foreign exchange were very excited there there are a lot of times when were doing things that may seem extremely technical but they actually have very big impacts on market structure and have helped us enormously so one of things i talked about last year was the fact that we had reduced our minimum price increments on four of our large fx contracts so we halved the minimum price increment on our euro versus dollar we halved it on the yen versus dollar the dollar versus the canadian dollar and the dollar versus the mexican peso what that means now is for the electronic algorithms within the banks because weve got a much more competitive product with a much tighter bidoffer spread much better liquidity were getting a much higher volume so interesting in the first quarter our volume with banks was up by  in our foreign exchange marketplace even though our overall volumes were down because of much lower volatility at the same time the two largest otc platforms that publicly offer foreign exchange we significantly outperformed their volumes terrence a duffy  cme group inc so just to add to what sean said and i think he summed it up very well but theres always ebbs and flows not only to our us participants but also to our european and asian participants so thats i think just what were seeing a little bit here and theres nothing more than that and i think with the initiatives that weve outlined with the capital efficiencies the innovation in our interest rate complex you might see some trading in different venues but ultimately people are migrating to our products as the numbers dictate patrick j oshaughnessy  raymond james  associates inc thank you terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you john w pietrowicz  cme group inc thanks operator well go next to kyle voigt with kbw kyle voigt  keefe bruyette  woods inc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just one on market data again i believe the prior  to  the growth guidance excluded pricing changes so can you just give us an update on the pricing moves or potential pricing moves and maybe if you have any plan to increase pricing over the next  months sean tully  cme group inc yeah we do not have any pricing planned this year so we are always looking at our products and adding new products and augmenting additional customers but we dont have any planned price increases thus far bryan t durkin  cme group inc and as i alluded to earlier this is targeting other consumers of the data than what you would view as your core market data participants so its actually a new pipeline of activity that were driving towards and theyll be paying for those services terrence a duffy  cme group inc and this is a – let me answer this in a broader way one of the reasons it gave us the opportunity to do the things were doing to create the efficiencies is because we were able to build liquidity around the clock on our globex platform we dont want to disrupt that liquidity so on the market data side to bryans point we dont need to tack – or add on additional costs to our core participants who are providing that aroundtheclock liquidity but we go after these new forms if people are coming to us and were going to them thats really where the incremental revenue is going to come from on market data kyle voigt  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thanks and then if i could have just one followup maybe for sean on the rates business youre seeing stronger yearonyear growth in futures open interest in rates than youve seen in quite some time and one of the questions from the investment community is really around the sustainability of this growth in a rising rate environment where most of the activity in hedging and repositioning actually happens ahead of the rate moves and just as rates start to move i guess could you help us understand what users are coming in to build the open interest really just over the past two quarters thats driven the really significant open interest growth and then how sustainable you believe that is going forward sean tully  cme group inc sure i appreciate the opportunity so think about it we grew our  even during zero interest rate policy with new product innovations new product extensions and weve been growing the open interest for quite some time if you think heres an interesting point for example during the zero interest rate policy we focused a lot on liquidity further out the curve in our greens in our blues and further out so the third year and the fourth year of eurodollar futures one of the things that youre seeing come to fruition now is in  we launched a third year of quarterlies in our eurodollar options in  we launched for the first time in cme groups history a fourth year of quarterlies in eurodollar options those options that we launched in  are now  so for the first time weve been able to have four years worth of accumulation of open interest in the existing contracts in our options complex so i dont see anything any ceiling of any sort we will get penetration of the cash market weve grown it very substantially from on the order of  of the cash market on our treasury futures in  to now  if you think about our sp futures and if you look at our sp futures penetration of the cash market we actually trade in our sp futures on a daily basis a larger risk amount than all of the cash exchanges combined so there is no ceiling in the case of sp our penetration is over  so i dont see any ceiling on that growth kyle voigt  keefe bruyette  woods inc okay thank you terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you operator im sorry sir go ahead terrence a duffy  cme group inc is there further questions operator we do have two remaining in queue sir terrence a duffy  cme group inc okay go ahead operator well go to vincent hung with autonomous vincent hung  autonomous research us lp hi sorry maybe i missed it but is  million the quarterly run rate for market data revenue for the year now terrence a duffy  cme group inc we havent provided any guidance i would say that its rangebound vincent hung  autonomous research us lp okay and you highlighted your strength in options and futures can you maybe talk about the attractiveness of options and futures and any sense as to why your peers arent doing more to catch up with you derek l sammann  cme group inc yeah vincent its derek here i think if you look at the – weve provided some slides here and youve seen these before relative to both our growth and our penetration the unique position that we find ourselves in is we are the largest derivatives engine in the world with a broadest asset class perspective so weve got – this year today i think were actually doing over  million contracts a day in april so we continue to go from strength to strength but be in a position where about weve got core benchmark liquidity across every major asset class what we focus on is building out the options associated with those futures and the infrastructure the technology the position we put ourselves in relative to extending the franchise at the enterprise level uniquely allows us to scale our technology investments in the ways that others that are maybe just an energy exchange or just an equities exchange are going to struggle to put that kind of investment behind so as we globalize our business as we port our liquidity electronically sean mentioned before the growth in eurodollar options electronically were up to  electronically thats the growth of our global participation in europe and asia questioning what others are doing or not doing i couldnt tell you but what i can tell you is were focused on client need giving them the most capitalefficient way to trade all of their risk in futures and options in a unique way in which we can provide the electronic delivery of that actionable liquidity alongside the capital efficiency of providing the underlying hedge with the option on the same platform in the same clearinghouse is unparalleled elsewhere vincent hung  autonomous research us lp thanks derek l sammann  cme group inc thanks vincent terrence a duffy  cme group inc thank you vincent operator and we have a followup from alex kramm with ubs terrence a duffy  cme group inc alex alex kramm  ubs securities llc yeah hey thanks again just one quick thing maybe this was addressed already but on the whole interest income from the clearinghouse with the  and so forth can you just remind us how the mechanics will work as rates move higher like i think youve said something about  for the customer and you keep  if i remember this correctly so if there are further rate hikes do you basically capture  basis points with every rate hike and then just in general on those line items i think that kind of – is there any way you guys can present us a little bit better the balances and the investment income i feel like its kind of get lost below the line here a little bit and i mean this has the potential to offset some of this market data weakness and i think it gets completely lost so just wondering if you can do a better job of presenting this going forward sean tully  cme group inc okay thank you thank you alex yes a couple a couple of things first off we have not said what were going to do with the next rate hike as you look at our fed funds futures kind of try to imply this is kind of a june move but we have not said what were going to do in terms of the amount were going to rebate back to our customers this is an important service that we provide our customers so its something that we want – to your point i think something that is core to what we do and we want to make sure that were highlighting it as effectively as we can and we probably should highlight it more especially when you take a look at what weve been able to do where were taking our nonoperating earnings from an expense a  million expense in the first quarter of  up to where were at today of  million – or  million in income so its this offering that we offer our customers and also its the sp joint venture – index business that we have with sp global thats also performing extremely well and producing around  million in earnings for us so when you take a look at that line its something that certainly the investing community should be aware of because these are two things that although are not in our direct operating expenses are important for our overall business so thats a couple of points that we wanted to highlight alex kramm  ubs securities llc absolutely thank you sean tully  cme group inc right thank you thanks for question alex terrence a duffy  cme group inc thanks alex operator therere no further questions id like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks terrence a duffy  cme group inc well let me thank all of you for participating today we appreciate
