stockholders there will be no proceeds to us from the sale of shares of class a common stock by the selling stockholders in this offering however we will receive the proceeds from the sale of shares of class a common stock to cornell capital partners under the equity line of credit the purchase price of the shares purchased under the equity line of credit will be equal to  of the lowest closing bid price of our common stock on the overthecounter bulletin board for the five days immediately following the notice date cornell capital partners will retain  of each advance made to us under the

general corporate purposes which include employee salaries cost of additional personnel support and management systems legal and professional costs and capital costs for computers related equipment and potentially acquisitions of other companies     total     except for the equity line of credit and the issuance of the secured convertible debentures the company has no other significant sources of working capital or cash commitments in addition management cannot be certain that it will generate significant revenue from product sales no assurance can be given that speechswitch will raise sufficient funds from such financing arrangements or that the company will ever produce sufficient revenues to sustain its operations or that a market will develop for its common stock upon which a significant amount of the companys financing is dependant if speechswitch is unable to recognize sufficient proceeds from these arrangements however management believes that speechswitch can limit its operations defer payments to management and maintain its business at nominal levels until it can identify alternative sources of capital in such event assuming the receipt of the minimum  proceeds from the equity line of credit management believes that speechswitch could maintain its operations for  months a number of companies have developed or are expected to develop products that compete with our products our competitors include ibm microsoft philips electronics and scansoft our competitors may combine with each other and other companies may enter our markets by acquiring or entering into strategic relationships with our competitors current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the abilities of their advanced speech and language technology products to address the needs of our prospective customers many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater financial technical product development and marketing resources greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies evolving industry trends and standards or customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of their products than we do accordingly we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets and competition may intensify and future competition may harm our business we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market include the breadth and depth of solutions product quality and performance core technology product scalability and reliability product features customer service the ability to implement solutions the value of a given solution the creation of a base of referenceable customers and the strength and breadth of reseller and channel relationships although we believe that our solutions currently compete favorably with respect to these factors particularly with respect to product quality and performance no assurance can be given that our competitors will not develop new technologies or enhancements to their existing products or introduce new products that will offer superior price or performance features we expect our competitors to offer new and existing products at prices necessary to gain or retain market share certain of our competitors have substantial financial resources which may enable them to withstand sustained price competition or a market downturn better than us there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the pricing of our products or otherwise in the future company description speechswitch inc which we refer to in this prospectus as speechswitch we us or the company was incorporated in new jersey on november   as a wholly owned subsidiary of ivoice inc ivoice while ivoice has been engaged in the speech recognition software and computerized telephony business since  ivoice management seeks to leverage the value of

licensing its intellectual property rights speechswitch will be a development stage company following the distribution speechswitch intends to seek to expand its operations through additional sales and marketing activity and the acquisition of additional businesses these potential acquired additional businesses may be outside the current field of operations of speechswitch speechswitch may not be able to identify successfully integrate or profitably manage any such businesses or operations speechswitch intends to continue to develop market and license the speech recognition line of
