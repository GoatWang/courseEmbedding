inc nasdaqcogt  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»why cogint is undervaluedjan  about cogint inc cogt jgr capital partners longshort equity valuejgr capital partners websitesummaryall companies need advertisements risk management and data analytics cogint is quickly expanding into these profitable marketscogint’s gross margins are the same or better than its competitors once its operations scale because of the implementation of its new segments its gross margins will increase even morehas many recurring fortune  client companies on its roster which proves the value of its offeringsfrom a valuation perspective the company looks attractive given its stronger topline growth relative to its peersbrief business description cogint nasdaqcogt is a big data and analytics company that provides solutions to its customers in three main segments risk management consumer marketing and custom analytics it is a cloudbased company that offers its services to a variety of sectors and industries with a focus on new datadriven marketing solutions cogint also helps companies manage risk and identify fraud within their technology company presentation investment overview small capitalization stocks are known for their risk and cogint is no different that said we recommend the company even though it suffered a loss last quarter one of the reasons it suffered a loss was a onetime writeoff of m for purchased ip and litigation costs the reason for this fee was that cogints subsidiary company the best one purchased intellectual property from ole poulsen on october   since the company had to defend its claim to the property from transunion risk  alternative data solutions source we do not expect this to be a recurring expense the company is in a development phase and still discovering its capabilities in the past cogints gross margins have been substantially higher than its competitors in the third quarter gross margins suffered as the company invested in growing its various business segments the companys gross margins came in at   lower than the last two quarters compared to its competitors such as transunion whose gross margin is  last quarter or corelogic nyseclgx whose gross margin is  cogint is still outperforming its competitors these strengths will likely scale soon cogs will lower and gross margins will increase substantially as the company begins to benefit from economies of scale cogint will outperform its competitors considerably in this area cogt increased its revenue by  over the secondquarter  according to its press release which is a positive indicator of growth the company is in a great position to increase revenue moving forward by creating new products that showcase its ability to combine different technologies that stem from its access to proprietary data another influential reason to purchase shares is the extensive list of the companies that use its services fortune  companies such as cheapflightscom western union nysewu shoe carnival nasdaqscvl all use cogints services they have been recurring customers of the business and are not simply onetime trial customers this recurring revenue stream is unique and great for investors as it provides a greater ability to predict earnings and free cash flow compared to other businesses company presentation company presentation valuation source author analysis source author analysis in order to value cogint we screened for comparable information and analytics companies using cogints projected consensus  revenue of  million and an average comparable company enterprise value to revenue multiple based on the  shares outstanding we are setting a month price target of  thus investors purchasing shares at current levels would enjoy substantial upside if our price target is achieved competition observing cogints competition they have a rustic dated feel about them transunion founded in  and fair isaac corporation nysefico founded in  especially seem to not have the relevancy or innovation that cogint exhibits working in the data analytics industry companies must not fall behind or they will be left behind these companies are ahead of cogint regarding their financial stance but this does not reflect its unique position in the market driven by its technology cogint has an important advantage over its competition namely its adaptability and catering to millennials and their unique needs additionally it has an experienced management team which has built and sold companies in this sector in the last decade it has become much difficult for companies to market to consumers people are accessing content in a variety of ways unlike its peers cogint combats this elusiveness by having  of consumer interactions through mobile devices we view cogints mobile strategy as powerful and also necessary as we move to an allmobile world company presentation insider trading at cogint is also a positive reflection on the outlook of the company the largest inside shareholder is ryan schulke the chief executive officer of fluent llc with  shares overall key insiders hold a total of  which is  of total shares and a market value of  for being in the early stages of this company it is a positive sign to see management so invested in it with cogints acquisitions of both fluent llc and q interactive inc the opportunity for growth has increased exponentially for the company as well as an increase in shareholder value each subsidiary has come with an improvement in leadership and management as well as an expansion of technology unique to both companies fluent llc will bring its expertise in peoplebased digital marketing and customer acquisition which uses mobile devices and survey responses to gain a deeper insight into customers buying decisions q interactive complements fluents digital marketing by providing hundreds of millions of leads to advertisers as well as validating consumer data such as email home address and phone number we expect these acquisitions will significantly benefit shareholders through synergistic growth an example of past big data mergers support this assumption ihs markit nasdaqinfo one of cogints competitors has used this tactic for the last couple of years to increase market share and shareholder value by bolting on smaller competitor companies when ihs acquired markit it received a tax break of around  as well as an increase in share price by nearly  thus we view acquisitions as a viable strategy for growth in this industry another highly publicized big data merger took place when dell acquired emc corp for  billion this buyout positions dell for significant growth as well as helping its transition from being a personal computer provider to a big data company emc specializes in information security data storage cloud computing big data analytics and covers around  of the data storage market to put that into perspective its double the amount of dell reflects the consideration paid at closing to fluents shareholders in idis common stock convertible preferred shares issued to sellers as purchase consideration  conversion ratio  equivalent common shares  share price of common stock as of december     purchase price amount paid in shares   source acquisition of q interactive source acquisition sources fluent q interactive core risk factors cogint operates in highly competitive and lucrative markets with many competitors that are larger failure to appeal to companies and gain understanding in how cogints products may benefit them may also be reflective in lowerthanexpected sales finally too much emphasis on a variety of products may lead individual product lines to be underdeveloped andor not gain sufficient market share summary cogint is a company that is still in its infancy and has financials that do not accurately reflect its potential this company is entering markets with a lot of opportunity for ingenuity and growth and has an advantage with its leadingedge technological products and proprietary data it will likely continue to exhibit strong topline growth cogint differentiates itself from its competitors by being cloud based and targeting consumers  through mobile devices the company has established itself as todays generations data analytics company through its adaptive strategy while older and dated companies are likely to get left behind cogints proven management and large insider ownership give confidence to shareholders that the company is headed in the right direction finally the acquisition of fluent llc and q interactive inc increases shareholder value significantly and opens opportunities that would have been unavailable to the company if it stood on its own disclosure i amwe are long cogt i wrote this

word in the business world more and more companies are investing heavily in big data and analytics as they look to better manage risks and predict consumer behaviors cogint inc nasdaqcogt formerly known as idi inc is a boca raton floridabased data and analytics company the company seeks to transform data into intelligence by using powerful analytics the ultimate goal is to provide clients this intelligence in a fast and efficient manner allowing them to focus on running their business the results of this are there to be seen according to an october  corporate presentation the company had a client retention rate of  that is solid by any standard this article seeks to focus on what the company is doing right where it is headed and what risks it faces going forward it also discusses an opportunity to unlock value through a potential spinoff but first we need to focus on the growing importance of big data cogt snapshot shares outstanding  mn current price  week range  market

estimates for eps   source finvizcom debtequity  source finvizcom price to sales  price to book  price to cash  big data is the future as i noted earlier big data is the buzz word in the business world nearly every industry group is investing heavily in the big data space below is the market share of some industry groups spending on big data at the end of the second half of  the data was provided by idc in its report worldwide semiannual big data and analytics spending guide source idc the concept of big data has been there for decades however in recent years technology has allowed to collate the data in an efficient manner to improve the decision making process and companies that can provide solutions that enable fast and efficient organization of this data will succeed in this business this is where cogint comes in with its powerful analytics about cogint cogint utilizes its two technology platforms core™ and agile acquisition engine™ to deliver solutions for its clients the company creates comprehensive datasets which are delivered in realtime and offer insightful views on the interrelationship between people businesses and assets the companys database consists of publicrecords proprietary and publiclyavailable information source company presentation source company presentation cogint is in the middle of two major and fast growing markets according to iab internet advertising revenue report published in  in the us alone internet advertising spending was close to  billion the companys addressable market in the us alone stands at  billion the key driver of this market of course is the adoption of mobile devices while growth of smartphone and tablets is expected to slowdown in the coming years shipments are still expected to reach  billion by  according to idc areas such as phablets are still expected to have doubledigit growth until  the other growing market that cogint is targeting is the risk analytics software market in the us alone this market was estimated to be more than  billion according to a  report published by marketsandmarkets overall the global business analytics market is expected to reach  billion by  according to idc growth not surprisingly will be driven by continuing migration towards cloud in terms of products cogint has four offerings the products include idicore and data acquisition solutions within the information services space and audience solutions and mobile acquisition engine within the performance marketing space source company presentation cogints client base currently includes companies such as western union cheapflightscom and finish line nasdaqfinl cogint has a major competitive advantage because of its comprehensive offering the company is present at each point of the value chain from platform to generating actionable intelligence none of the companies in the data mining space provide such a comprehensive product offering one of the biggest strengths of cogint is its top management the company is led by derek dubner dubner worked closely with hank asher who is known as the father of data mining cogints coo harry jordan served in a range of roles at lexisnexis risk solutions a division of reed elsevier jordan was in charge of lexisnexis healthcare he took the business from inception to more than  million in annual revenue cogints executive chairman michael brauser has been consistently buying shares in the company which is always a positive sign brauser was the founder of seisant which was acquired by lexisnexis for  million robust revenue growth strong balance sheet in the third quarter of  cogint reported consolidated revenue of  million up  on a sequential basis in terms of segments it was the companys performance marketing segments that contributed major portion of the revenue  million adjusted ebitda for the quarter was  million cogint also has a healthy balance sheet its cash balance at the end of the september quarter was  million in november the company raised another  million through a stock offering but more important is to focus on cogints future growth and that growth is most likely to come from idicore in fact once the product becomes a bigger part of the revenue mix it could boost ebitda margins which were one of the disappointments in the third quarter of  looking ahead cogint sees  revenue to come in between  million to  million this would represent growth of around  from the estimated revenue range for the full year  if this revenue growth can be combined with significant margin expansion then we have a strong investment case the companys longterm ebitda margin target is between  and  investment case unlocking the value the investment case for cogint is based on the increasing adoption of big data analytics the company stands out because of its unique product offering as i noted earlier it is present at every point of the value chain which gives it a huge advantage over competitors based on the  estimate for revenue cogint trades at just under x sales according to barrington research criteo a peer in the performance marketing space trades at a multiple of x sales even if you assign a discount of  to cogints multiple we are talking about a multiple of x estimated sales that translates to a valuation of more than double from current roughly  million even after applying the industry multiples though there is a significant valuation anomaly and this is where the cogt story gets even more interesting currently the valuation for cogt is based on just its fluent product offering in fact in the third quarter fluent generated  of the companys sales and nearly all of its gross profits the valuation of cogt is essentially based on fluent at the moment the consensus price target for cogt currently stands at  which translates to a market value of around  million that is roughly x  sales estimate like i noted this is just valuing the fluent business the market is not assigning any value for idicore this is understandable as the product is currently not contributing to the financial results however the future for cogt will be in idicore as idicore operations expand in the next twothree years valuation is expected to enhance in fact the product saw an encouraging launch in mid in the first month of its launch the company had  users for idicore which is an impressive number considering that the product is still evolving the valuation anomaly has also led to significant insider buying activity since november alone insiders have bought a total of  shares which translates to around  of total outstanding shares in the last nine months insiders have bought a total of  million shares back in may  insiders purchased at price as high as  per share highlighting the fact that insiders considered cogt undervalued even then the table below gives the insider buying transactions at cogint since november alone insider name insider title shares purchased date purchased price robert n fried director    jeff dell chief information officer nysecio    robert swayman director    ryan schulke ceo of fluent llc    derek dubner ceo    matthew conlin president of fluent llc    daniel maclachlan cfo    michael brauser chairman    phillip frost md director     harry jordan iii coo    ryan schulke ceo of fluent llc    matthew conlin president of fluent llc    michael brauser chairman    matthew conlin president of fluent llc    ryan schulke ceo of fluent llc    michael brauser chairman    ryan schulke ceo of fluent llc    michael brauser chairman    michael brauser chairman    harry jordan iii coo    michael brauser chairman    michael brauser chairman    robert swayman director    matthew conlin president of fluent llc    ryan schulke ceo of fluent llc    ryan schulke ceo of fluent llc    i believe that at some point cogt should consider spinning off the business to unlock its value in any case at current valuation cogt also looks an interesting ma target especially given the growing importance of big data and the fact that the market is valuing a key growth driver in idicore at nothing it is also important to note that with cogint there is no nearterm dilution risk the november offering has strengthened the companys balance sheet the major risks i foresee for cogint at the moment are operational the company needs to improve its ebitda margin the idicore product becoming a bigger part of mix could help the company in this regard in fact in a shareholder letter late last year ceo dubner noted that the company reverted to historically higher margins at the beginning of the fourth quarter another risk is the lack of liquidity with the cogt stock however this could improve with the companys move to the nasdaq cogt was previously listed on the nyse mkt but made a move to nasdaq in september when it also changed its corporate name the move to nasdaq combined with the growth prospects for big data should bring in more institutional investors disclosure i amwe are
