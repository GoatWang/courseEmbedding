 disclosure explanatory note while the company was not a shell company prior to the share exchange the company has chosen to include all form  information related to altitude in this k as part of its ongoing efforts in public disclosure as disclosed in this report on june   we acquired altitude international inc a wisconsin entity in the athletic training industry specifically altitude training the company will generate revenue through northern central and south america sales by way of its sole distribution agreement with woodway inc our objective is to be recognized as one of the upper tier specialty altitude training equipment providers the acquisition of altitude international inc was a material transaction to our existing operations accordingly we are providing below the information that would be included in a form  if we were to file a form  please note that the information provided below relates to the combined enterprises after the acquisition of altitude international inc except that information relating to periods prior to the date of the acquisition of altitude only relate to titan computer services unless otherwise specifically indicated business corporate history altitude international inc specializes in creating uniquelyengineered membranebased designs for simulated altitude training environments the product line ranges from personal at home use machines to fully integrated environmental rooms and chambers through a license agreement with sporting edge uk ltd a brand wellestablished in the united kingdom the company intends to expand its technology into the american marketplace where the appetite for increasing performance in elite athletes professional sports equine sports and universities and colleges is immense business strategy the company will seek to set itself apart from other altitude training technology by introducing to elite athletes health and fitness clubs and profession sports teams novel training techniques proven to increase performance the company has developed technology and training protocols that make possible large improvements in fitness and performance in normal room environments the wellfinanced sports market of north america offers the company opportunities to manufacture and distribute its products to a welcoming customer base industry operating environment whether at the olympic level or in professional and college teams  top level sports require individuals to perform at their maximum potential margins between success and failure are small  the difference between first and last in the tour de france is three percent  and athletes constantly seek to close the gap between success and failure many american athletes currently engage in altitude training by travelling to elevations of about ft to train in air with decreased oxygen levels though this type of training has its benefits it does not come without costs traveling creates a disruption to an athletes normal training schedule as well as considerable economic costs to travel and train in those locations altitudes licensed technology allows for all the benefits of altitude training without the disruptions of travel us suppliers of altitude training equipment exist but they use an entirely different technology that almost entirely focuses on a mask based approach this cumbersome approach is not favored by the athletes and impedes normal breathing patterns altitudes approach is to create room environments that are not only precisely controllable for simulated altitude level but also for temperature and humidity  allowing the climate of almost any location on the planet to be replicated this allows many combinations of altitude heat and humidity stresses to be created and also provides for preacclimatization of players about to compete outside their normal climate zone these additional stresses deliver increased benefits compared to altitude training alone development the product designs to be licensed from sporting edge uk ltd are proven and cover a wide range of room sizes the only requirement is to change from metric to imperial sizes where necessary   there are three unique elements to the altitude proposition · sophisticated touch screen control systems capable of integrating the control of simulated altitude temperature and humidity · a unique design of air separation unit with only a single active part that provides for ultrareliable operation and a design life of greater than fifteen years · proven training protocols that allow the desired training benefits to be achieved we have included some photos of what our systems will look like image removed   image removed image removed altitude will lease space in the woodway facility in waukesha wisconsin to undertake the manufacture of systems the work will primarily consist of the assembly of components into the unique licensed designs initial recruitment of technicallycapable persons will be necessary followed by short training blocks to pass on the required skills at least one person is likely to visit the uk to see systems in operation and obtain handson experience of the manufacturing requirement woodway is an engineeringbased company and so is a perfect environment in which to establish an operation which is in many ways similar to their own in addition many aspects of infrastructure  goods handling welfare facilities etc  can be accessed immediately without expense to altitude     item  changes in control of the registrant on june   after the closing of certain stock purchase agreements in
