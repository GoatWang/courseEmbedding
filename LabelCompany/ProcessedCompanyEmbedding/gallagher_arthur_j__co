in the investor relations section of the company’s website it is now my pleasure to introduce j patrick gallagher chairman president and ceo of arthur j gallagher mr gallagher you may begin patrick gallagher thank you very much and good morning everyone thank you for joining us for our second quarter  earnings call with me this morning is doug howell our chief financial officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions as we do each quarter today doug and i are going to talk about the four key components of our value creation strategy those are number one organic growth two growing through mergers and acquisitions three improving our productivity and quality and four maintaining our very unique gallagher culture the team really delivered on all  of the strategic priorities this quarter resulting in excellent top and bottom line results i am extremely pleased with our first half performance which sets the stage for another outstanding year in  let me start with some comments on our broker segments second quarter allin organic growth was  up nicely over our first quarter to the first two quarters  organic stands at  right in line with the level of organic we experienced last year let me give you some granularity around our brokerage segment organic growth in the quarter in the us organic growth was about  for the quarter with retail growth stronger than wholesale internationally allin organic was about  for the quarter with australia new zealand canada and the uk all delivering organic growth greater than  just a fantastic job by our international team all of our brokerage operations that are on the globe grew organically in the quarter and my optimism for the remainder of the year is based on the broad strength of our operation as i said in the first quarter i continue to see full year  organic growth in our brokerage segment similar to s result moving to the rate environment our internal data shows global pc pricing down only a point in the quarter very similar to last quarter and when i look at the first two quarters combined pricing improved by  basis points compared to  within our global retail business one really interesting observation is in australia and new zealand pricing has really turned as higher by  to  during the second quarter by product line commercial auto is still experiencing highest rate increases up about  within the us during the second quarter professional liabilities experiencing positive pricing overall particularly within us wholesale which was up  and uk retail was up  the recent rate trends we are seeing in our own internal data were further validated by responses to our annual internal pricing survey which indicated global pc pricing as down about  basis points in  further our midyear internal rate survey showed almost twothirds of the respondents expecting no significant change in pricing for the rest of the year so in the end up a point or down a point this is effectively a stable pricing environment second let me talk about brokerage merger and acquisition growth we completed nine tuckin acquisitions this quarter at a weighted average multiple of about  times ebitdac the average size of the  tuckins we completed in the quarter was  million of annualized revenue as i look at our internal merger and acquisition report our pipeline remains full i see about  million of revenue associated with around  term sheets either agreed upon or being prepared not all these transactions will close but we believe we have the right mixture of culture service capabilities niches and tools that will continue to attract talented independent sales and consulting professionals to our organization as i do every quarter i would like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and i extend a very warm welcome to our growing gallagher family of professional third i want to spend some time on our productivity and quality last month the entire senior leadership team was in london now that our large merger integration is essentially behind us the focus was on the opportunities ahead for our uk operation by leveraging our centers of excellence streamlining the back office becoming more efficient on small business and standardizing process we should be able to increase our margins improve quality and delivery sustainable organic growth its an exciting time for our uk team so to wrapup the brokerage segment the team posted  total adjusted revenue growth and  organic adjusted ebitdac growth of  and adjusted ebitdac margin was  up  basis points over second quarter  so really strong results sitting here at the half way market for our brokerage team next i would like to move to our risk management segment which is primarily gallagher bassett second quarter organic growth was  and reflects excellent organic growth domestically and internationally the team has notched a number of new business wins this year across all segments and geographies many of which were directly with insurance carriers in terms of merger and acquisition growth our risk management team completed two acquisitions in the quarter one in new zealand and the other in the uk both of these new merger partners have unique capabilities that will increase and help round out our service offerings in these respective geographies risk management adjusted ebitdac margins showed about  basis points of yearoveryear improvement and fell within our expected range for the quarter at  the team has done really a fantastic job managing headcount as the segment was experiencing lower levels of organic growth over the past couple of quarters lastly culture our culture is the key differentiator of our company and we are constantly looking for the right people to join us whether through new hires mergers and acquisitions or internship program in august we will conclude our nd year of the gallagher summer internship program this extensive two month program for over  young men and women is an essential investment in our future and is forming a rock solid foundation for our culture for many many years to come okay an excellent quarter a great half for the year i will stop now and turn it over to doug doug doug howell thanks pat and good morning everyone like pat said a really terrific second quarter and first half of  this morning my comments are going to cover some modeling items using the cfo commentary document that we posted on our investor website as well as my typical commentary and margins clean energy ma and cash and capital management okay first page  of the cfo commentary you will see that most all of the second quarter  actual numbers came in very close for the estimates that we provided during our june th investor day in addition you will see that our third and fourth quarter commentary is right in line with what we provided in june also so really no new news on page  next please turn to page  of the cfo commentary to the table showing you rollin revenues from ma during our june  ir day we provided our updated estimate of  million of rollin revenues now we posted right about that number  million however it looks to us like indiscernible consensus was about  million with some having a much wider range around that number while  million of difference to the consensus isnt a huge number it does cause about a penny of difference in eps we fully understand that making an estimate for rollover revenues is a difficult pact so we will continue to provide an update towards the end of each quarter during our quarterly ir meeting meanwhile please take a few minutes extra when you are updating your models between now and then okay let’s move back to the earnings release and some comments on the brokerage segment margin adjusted brokerage ebitdac margin expanded  basis points in the quarter nearly all of our operating units around the world held or improved margins and nice healthy results reflecting strong operational discipline natural question might be why did adjusted margins expand a  basis points in the first quarter and  organic net expense  basis points and  organic here in the second quarter it has to do with our seasonality and the rollin of ma first is understanding that our second quarter is by far our highest margin quarter at  first  in the first quarter second to understand that the tranche of mergers that are moving in this year do not have the same second quarter seasonality in fact this tranche of ma rolling in is posting about  margins both in the first and second quarter accordingly they didnt really impact margins in the first quarter and overall we were at  but here in the second quarter when overall were poking  they do bring down margins if i were to levelize for this in the second quarter we would have posted about  to  basis points on margin expansion here in this second quarter i hope that answers the natural question that might arise now looking forward last year the brokerage segment adjusted margins were  in the third quarter and  in the fourth quarter again you can see some seasonality there and we posted about  to  basis points of margin expansion last year in those quarters over  that expansion came on organically about  in each quarter so this year were targeting similar margins in the third and fourth quarter so please don’t model much of any margin expansion in the second half now lets move to our risk management segment we posted adjusted ebitdac margin of  as pat mentioned the team did a great job of controlling the headcount as we move past a lower period of organic growth which but it still resulted into margin expansion here in the second quarter we continued to see margins for the full year in the range of  to  lets turn to clean energy with a warm june we had a great second quarter and our earnings came into the high end of our estimate you can see on page  of the cfo commentary that if we hit the midpoint of the full year range it will be a nice step up in  but also i have to say we all understand that weathers going to impact those estimate a cooler summer or a warmer early winter can move our estimates by a million at june   we have about  million of tax credits on our balance sheet effectively a  million receivable from the government this assets will reduce our future cash taxes paid for many years to come even with or without tax reform next ma were still seeing fair pricing on tuckin merger with a weighted average multiple through june  of below a time it shows that merger partners are choosing gallagher because they value our capabilities and our culture and they know that we will be better together when i look at our pipeline i see similar pricing for the rest of the year finally cash at june  were pushing  million or pushing up towards  million of available cash on our balance sheet combined with a debt offering announced in june it looks like we can fund it  ma with free cash in debt so those are my comments outstanding organics solid execution and our tuckin ma program excellent operational discipline and margin expansion at a strong cash position a terrific quarter and terrific half on all measures thank you pat patrick gallagher thank you doug and operator were ready to open up for questions hopefully some answers questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions our first question is coming from elyse greenspan of wells fargo please go ahead elyse greenspan hi good morning patrick gallagher good morning elyse elyse greenspan my first question on is just on the organic outlook just combined with a broad i guess more color on the market as you think to the back half of the year to hit your full year target would imply maybe just a little bit of a stepup in the first half of the year as you think about that how are you thinking about organic internationally should it remain as strong as we saw in the second quarter and then also what are you seeing on exposure growth in the us but also around the world patrick gallagher well as it relates to organic internationally im pretty bullish we got rate improvement in new zealand and australia those businesses are doing very well weve got positive organic in canada and the uk at a level thats greater than the united states in the us is in very nicely positive organic so i feel the  should look and feel a lot like  elyse greenspan and then what about exposure growth patrick gallagher exposure growth is interesting its not having much impact yet when i look at the worldwide employment figures i keep wondering when exposure is going to show some nice shoots but it has an impact that is by more than a percent elyse greenspan so the exposure growth does start to pick up that would be additive to your debt and close outlook patrick gallagher absolutely elyse greenspan okay great and then you guys in the commentary pointed to flat margins in the brokerage business for the second half of the year i guess if you continued hit say about  organic i know there are some of those acquisitions doug that you pointed to coming in but why wont you be able to expand margins or is it just a matter of some investments i know that youve spoken about in the past that youre making on within the company doug howell yes historically in the second half of the year margins expansion has not been as much in the first half thus far yeartodate were up  basis points were in a similar position last year this time we brought it in right around  basis points for the full year part of the reason for that is we typically give our reasons during the second half of the year those will be coming in so that does have a little bit of a  it keeps margins from expanding as much because thats when we give the raises and then we see the result of that as whats full there so basically like were saying this year feels a lot like last year if we end at  for the year if we end up with just a little bit of margin expansion in the third and fourth quarter well bring it in somewhere around  basis points of margin expansion on  organic growth thats pretty much so how the model work patrick gallagher also in september typically when we bring our into our new hires on elyse greenspan okay great and then in terms of the weighted average share count went up a little bit in the quarter is that due i think last quarter you pointed out the stock comp accounting i think has a weight as your share count am i thinking about that correct is there something else going on there doug howell yes let me clarify in that it really doesnt this stock option the new stock option accounting produces a little bit of a gain in the corporate segment that used to go through it goes with the pl now it used to go through other comprehensive income it doesnt really impact the number of shares outstanding the reason why shares are creeping up a little it right now is we do have  we did have more stock option exercises in the first half of the year so that puts more shares out of the market our employee stock purchase plan puts them out into them so that increases it we did use some shares in ma this quarter in tax reexchange so that puts it out but recall we purchased those last year so i think were still above flat when it comes to shares purchased last year versus those years weve issued an ma so were pretty bottom so thats the three pieces that caused the slight creep from i think were at a  million last quarter and were pushing a  million this quarter elyse greenspan okay great thanks very much for the color patrick gallagher thanks elyse operator thank you our next question is coming from kai pan morgan stanley please proceed with your question unidentified analyst hi there thanks good morning actually its mike phillips sitting for kai pan this one good morning everybody patrick gallagher good morning mike unidentified analyst question on  good morning supplemental continued to commissions as they grew pretty well in the quarter i guess just of your outlook on there for the second half of the year how that varies by quarter and seasonality and then how much did that impact the margin growth in the quarter doug howell yes all right first and foremost the different three ways in supplemental ive always said is kind of its a blurry line between that so i wouldnt read too terribly much into the fact that it grew  yeartodate in base of that pack  and there is some blurred lines there i think that continue commissions of the one that there really kind of have a little bit more impact to the bottom line and theyre up  in the yeartodate so it does have a little impact on margin expansion maybe  or  basis points by the time you look at after compensation elements that are associated with that unidentified analyst okay great thanks and then i guess second one just more broadly what impact do you think will have on you guys of the uso and wells fargo deal i guess acquisition activity and maybe organic growth as well doug howell well i mean i wouldn’t comment on what itll do for organic growth but whenever theres change in the business and people are looking for another place to maybe rest their head we try to provide a pretty nice house unidentified analyst okay so no major impact i guess lastly on clean coal with its sunset coming just refresh us again on your view of the prospects for tax reform and kind of what youre pursuing other tax wedded fields to keep your cycle tax rate down doug howell great question i don’t really have any views on tax reform at this point i think its a crap shoot anyway you look at it i think that regardless what happens we have generated a substantial amount of credit carry forwards  million of them well use those going into the future we can produce new credits all the way through  by the time we get to that in the current tax environment with our current balance sheet i don’t think there will be a paying meaningful taxes in the us until late in the s what do we have wind up between  and  for further reductions and taxes i don’t know at this time but weve been very good over since the history of gallagher build always find some new tax credit strategy so well see how the thats something well start working on in  unidentified analyst okay great thanks very much i appreciate it doug howell thanks mike unidentified analyst yes operator thank you our next question is coming from adam klauber of william blair please go ahead adam klauber thanks good morning everyone patrick gallagher good morning adam adam klauber just a couple of different questions did i hear correctly did you say us wholesale rates were up  to  doug howell on professional lines adam klauber on professional lines okay well in wholesale whats the just generally the ballpark the level of submissions and how does that compare to a year ago patrick gallagher submissions were up nicely probably up   finding continues to hit ratio continues to be pretty significant and the business is very very healthy adam klauber okay and then how about the benefit business is that growing more or less in the overall us retail business patrick gallagher a little bit more adam klauber okay doug howell yes not measurably more i mean maybe just  this quarter versus  all in adam klauber okay and then i think you mentioned exposures are doing generally okay how about audit premiums are those more a tail wind today than a year ago patrick gallagher no theyre not a tail wind its kind of flattish thats why the thats kind of the quandary were seeing employment figures look strong and i see that globally and yet were really not seeing payrolls jump and were not seeing sales jump so its the audits are kind of flattish adam klauber okay thanks thats all i had patrick gallagher thanks adam doug howell thanks adam operator thank you our next question is coming from arash soleimani of kbw please go ahead arash soleimani hi thanks patrick gallagher good morning arash soleimani good morning couple of quick questions i know you had mentioned that  million pipeline and the brokerage ma within the risk for gallagher bassett i think you said that you had recently hired a full time ma person and you didn’t have a full time person in that capacity before im just wondering how should we think given that how should we think of the pipeline there doug howell i don’t know if we actually said theres a full time person inside a gallagher bassett i have a team of folks that are really good about looking for opportunities i remember in gallagher bassett what were looking for is geographic expansion and where our multinational clients we want to have us have places to do business thats one thing we look for the other thing is there are some nice specialty claim related businesses out there that can round out our product offering and offering to our client those are the two types of things that were looking for there and so but it’s gallagher bassett provides a full array of services so those are they are out there but there is not an abundance of them patrick gallagher and youre not going to see the level of activity out of gallagher bassett that you see in a brokerage unit the brokerage the brokerage world is incredibly fragmented its virtually huge and the opportunities are limitless doug howell and thats not a business where were just trying to acquire people for our customer list we do really well on competing every day for that type of business organically so just to be able to pick up scale through a customer list is not something thats all that interesting to us arash soleimani okay thats helpful thanks and my other question is and within your interim program how many of those interims typically come on full time patrick gallagher so you take we are  instance this summer and the split between people who finished their sophomore year in college and people who finished the junior year and the juniors are probably will be something on the order of a  out of that  so theyre going back for their senior year well probably recruit of about  of those there will be starters in september of  and by the way five years later well have  of those still with us and  years later well have  of those arash soleimani okay great thank you very much for the answers patrick gallagher take care operator operator instructions our next question is coming from mark hughes of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead mark hughes yes thank you good morning patrick gallagher good morning mark hughes any change in underlying claims frequent your severity within the risk management business patrick gallagher no not really i mean claims frequencys probably up  and that severity has not shown any real change mark hughes and then the medical professional liability you talked about professional lines being up about medical professional patrick gallagher medical professionals kind of flat mark hughes and then whole sale i think you had in your opening comments that retail was above average wholesale below average in terms of growth is that a change from the recent trend that it decelerated this quarter doug howell yes there is that no its been about this same there is one program in particular in our trucking business that if you recall weve talked about this before that the carriers have kind of come in and out of that and so we lost our market on it that pushes back a little bit theres markets that are coming back into the space now when pricings a little bit more reasonable so i would say that we see that it tends to be a little bit more of a volatile business than lets say our basic brokerage retail space so when a market comes in and out of a space it does tell you till the last few quarters the trucking business kind of held us back a little bit on that but still close in those single digits is good for that space right now mark hughes and then what did you say your available cash was at the  doug howell were pushing  million right now mark hughes  million okay thank you very much doug howell thanks mark patrick gallagher thanks mark operator thank you our next question is coming from ryan tunis of credit suisse please go ahead unidentified analyst hi this is crystal lu in for ryan i just have a question on the acquisition this quarter the case of acquisition seem to upload a little bit and even though the yeartodate is basically on pace as a year ago i thought that the target is goal is to spend about  million on acquisitions this year is that still what youre targeting to spend more than you spend in  patrick gallagher well crystal this is pat let me address the number of deals and then ill let doug talk about the amount well spend on them the merger and acquisition process is a sales process just like when we go out and get new cars and these things its not like you get to turn on this big and say well do six this month and next month well do seven i mean these are entrepreneurs that are selling their baby and we get that and theyre not coming aboard until theyre ready and we got to do out due diligence so doing the number that weve done this year is still a very good pace for us and if it accelerates a little bit in the second half great and if it slows down a little bit thats fine too we want to get the right partners on the boat and were not just trying to do deals doug howell no i think from cash flow standpoint we do still see ourselves spending  million to  million on deals this year if they  if depending on the pipeline develops the way we think it will we still see a lot of deals in that sub eight multiple range that we really like tuckin acquisitions and if its a little lower than last year it wouldn’t be by much if its a little more than last year it wouldn’t be much either and triply if we ended up with a situation where we didn’t have so much may we buy stock back with that would have to look at what our pipeline would be for the first quarter and remember the one thing to remember is that historically our first half of the year is slower when it comes to ma in the second half of the year unidentified analyst great thats helpful and the one other question was ive noticed as sum of the margin expansion this quarter came from headcount control is this part of something that is a broad initiative thats happening across the company that you think will continue to the rest of the year or is it just something that happens periodically just one time doug howell now weve actually had nice headcount controls for last couple of years on that i think as our technologies are innovative technology that we put into the middle output layer come online allows us to contract our domestic workforce with having very good success with pushing work into our offshore centers of excellence so thats helping us control our headcount so its with the operational discipline of harvesting the hard work that we put in over the last decade become an operationally excellent company and thats really whats happening its allowing us to control the headcount which is really important if we get into an inflationary wage environment thats a competitive advantage for us in that weve proven that our technologys work and that we can control our headcount for it unidentified analyst okay doug howell and whats interesting is our quality with our customers has gone up dramatically even during this time unidentified analyst great thank you so much patrick gallagher thank you crystal operator operator instructions patrick gallagher ill just make a few comments and then well say thank you for being with us thats what id like to say is thank you again for being with us this morning in closing im extremely pleased with our first half performance and i believe  is shaping up to be another outstanding year we look forward to speaking with you again in october and having a

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
