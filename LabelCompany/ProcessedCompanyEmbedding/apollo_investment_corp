better since  hi fool premium advice help fool answers contact us login search search apollo investment corp will diversification prevent past troubles from happening again apollo investment corporation is a longstanding player in the bdc world what can we learn from its history anna b wroblewska abwroblewska jul   at pm source company apollo investment corporation nasdaqainv is one of the larger players in the bdc space with a market cap of about  billion and a year history the companys portfolio is externally managed by an affiliate of apollo global management which is to say its part of the apollo global private equity family that firm cofounded by leon black and two partners has been around for  years and is one of the big players in the leveraged buyout world  apollo went public in  and today sports a fairly diversified portfolio of middlemarket debt products and equities targeting companies with  million to  billion in revenue the company also invests in structured products and foreign securities  over the course of its  year history apollo has invested some  billion in  companies quite a long track record for a bdc although its one that isnt without its blemishes the innkeepers fiascothe financial crisis was not kind to apollo  a story best illustrated by its poorly timed purchase in innkeepers usa trust a publicly traded reit that the company purchased and took private through an affiliate  apollo bought innkeepers in  for a total value of  billion including debt you might recall that real estate was rather hot at the time and the commercial space was no exception the purchase was part of a larger trend of public reits being taken private in the clamor for position in commercial real estate as the wall street journal put it when describing the deal there were already signs of trouble in  and innkeepers filed for bankruptcy the following year falling valuations reduced revenue and a considerable debt burden related to the apollo purchase were behind the bankruptcy and unfortunately for apollo innkeepers represented a major portion of the companys portfolio  after a long backandforth which included both a deal and a lawsuit most of innkeepers assets were sold to cerberus capital management a private equity fund and chatham lodging trust a reit toward the end of  the two companies bought the bulk of innkeepers portfolio of hotels for  billion diversifying and reducing riskthe affair obviously had a major impact on the firms earnings by that time shares of apollo had lost about a third of their value and the company decided to adjust its strategy probably to keep things going a move into larger cap credits didnt work so apollo decided to diversify even establishing an energy team in houston in the aftermath and some adjustment pains apollo  has developed a focus in three key areas namely aviation oil and gas and structured products in the past year the company has sold  billion of assets to improve the risk profile of the portfolio and to reduce leverage and improve interest rate coverage   lessons learned the innkeepers story and its aftermath offers an interesting perspective on the myriad risks involved with bdcs  the first is of course that bdcs are rather credit dependent when the going is good financing and deals can come easily but as soon as credit dries up and investors get nervous things can go south very quickly apollo was no exception it fairly hobbled through the financial crisis because its portfolio and management werent prepared to withstand a change in fortune it also brings to mind some of the risks of diversification which apollo has also turned to in the years since its clear now that like many the company didnt quite grasp the real estate market at the time and you cant help but wonder if its really pursuing a sustainable competitive advantage in the various areas its targeting now how do we know that apollo is really that good at energy for example or at originating loans  finally im all for forwardlooking risk reduction in a portfolio but im curious to find out more about apollos structured products how riskaverse can a company be while playing in this space and how deeply does ainv pursue this strategy these are questions worth asking  anna wroblewska has no position in any stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends apollo
