information platform rich west  jul   blog interactive spatial analysis with massive datasets james dilworth  jul   blog events in the press gpu database – designed from the ground up to deliver truly realtime insights gpu acceleration changes the game for fast data analytics for locationbased analytics and for predictive analytics gpus are designed around thousands of small efficient cores that are well suited to performing repeated similar instructions in parallel this makes them wellsuited to the computeintensive workloads required of large data sets some of the latest high performance gpus from nvidia feature over  cores versus  to  cores per typical cpubased device gpu cores crunch data far more efficiently and quickly than cpus—which process data sequentially why another database play so much raw compute power you wont need to think about indexing partitioning or downsampling icon very low latency with less to index data is available immediately after it is written no more waiting for data structures to be updated before the data can be returned in queries icon ask any question since there is no need to prepare the schema before it can be explored business analysts have complete flexibility and freedom for data discovery projects icon linear scale out with simpler data structures the database scales in proportion to the size of the data this leads to smaller and more predictable hardware costs how gpuacceleration enables faster and more flexible olap processing » did we mention speed xx faster than even the most advanced inmemory databases in tests kinetica returns results for advanced analytical queries on billions of rows of data in well under a second priceperformance  download the white paper » scale out on industrystandard hardware the efficiencies of kineticas gpu architecture typically result in hardware costs that are ⁄ that of other inmemory databases as datasets grow kinetica is able to scale out across multiple nodes kinetica leverages the raw compute power of the gpu to break open processing bottlenecks and reduce reliance on indexes in addition to performance benefits customers experience dramatic efficiency gains kinetica sometimes requires just ⁄ of the hardware and ⁄ of the power when compared to other inmemory analytics solutions kinetica runs on commodity hardware that scales out linearly to meet your needs play   more on kineticas performance and efficiency at scale certified to run on premise with or in the cloud accelerated by a single database for bi ai and geospatial workloads kinetica provides a range of methods for data scientists analysts and line of business users to perform sophisticated analytics with large datasets on a single converged platform icon write queries in sql kinetica has broad support for sql interaction through its odbc connector this makes it easy for analysts to be productive quickly while datascientists and developers can take advantage of the native rest api or a variety of connectorssql query support » icon use with popular bi tools connect popular bi tools such as tableau and powerbi to kinetica for realtime analytics using the odbcjdbc connector or use open source frontend visualization tools such as kibana superset or kineticas own reveal framework   icon full text search full text search functionality is supported by natural language processing nlp full result sets can be returned or rendered on a map results aren’t limited to the first   or  pages of relevant information text search capabilities » icon user defined functions udfs offer an extensible and highly flexible framework for performing advanced analytics predictive analytics and machine learning with data stored in kinetica udfs have direct access to cuda apis and can take full advantage of the distributed architecture of kinetica indatabase analytics » icon geospatial operations kinetica has native support for geospatial objects points shapes tracks and comes with a suite of geospatial functions for filtering data by area by track custom shapes and more spatial operations are exponentially faster for massive datasets than traditional systems locationbased analytics » icon visualization pipeline kineticas opengl rendering pipeline is capable of drawing massive point datasets as wms layers for use over maps kinetica can also generate heatmaps scatterplots and even video native serverside rendering makes it possible to plot millions of points without bandwidth constraints mapping  visualization api »   power and capability for developers and administrators ingest from multiple sources prebuilt connectors for apache kafka apache nifi apache spark spark streaming apache storm and odbcjdbc make it simple to ingest data from a wide range of data sources see examples » scale out kinetica provides linear scalability on industry standard hardware data replication is handled for high availability sharding can be done automatically or specified and optimized by the user comprehensive apis kinetica can easily be interacted with via restful http endpoints supports both json and avro serialization open source native language bindings can be found for java python javascript and c more » advanced analytics with indatabase processing userdefined functions udfs enable compute as well as data processing within the database kinetica uniquely offers such functionality on a database that fully utilizes the parallel compute power of the gpu indatabase processing brings ai and bi together » kinetica reveal  inbuilt bi  visualization tools bring your own bi dashboard or take advantage of kinetica reveal — a webbased visualization framework that makes it easy to slice dice and visualize data in kinetica reveal works with kineticas native geospatial visualization pipeline to make it possible to see changes across large datasets as the underlying data or queries change allow users to easily and intuitively visualize datasets and share interactive dashboards visualize billions of data points on a map filter and query them with realtime response take advantage of a wide gamut of geospatial visualization renderers such as feature class break heat maps and geofencing find out more about reveal » kinetica is able to render billions of points on a map in under a second learn more » try out kinetica today try kinetica with reveal – our flexible
