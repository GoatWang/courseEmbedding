company’s cto for almost four years and with the company for five years said today he was leaving the company twitter vp of product josh mcfarland is also leaving to join greylock partners messinger made the announcement in — no surprise — a tweet after  years i’ve decided to leave twitter and take some time off grateful to jack for the opportunity and to my team for shipping — adam messinger adammessinger december   so in short the round robin at twitter’s top echelon continues last month coo adam bain left the company as anthony noto took over and now twitter has lost another pair of top executives beyond that earlier this month twitter’s director of media partnerships and head of news government and elections adam sharp said he was leaving the company amid all this chaos sudden changes at the top — which for twitter seems like a regular event at this point — can lead to equal confusion down the ranks especially as twitter tries to remake itself into something a little less confusing to attract new users while twitter over the years has shored up its reliability when’s the last time you saw the fail whale it still needs to figure out how to keep the upper ranks

messinger’s aren’t all that uncommon — especially for executives who have been in those positions for a long time it’s still happening at a rough time in twitter’s history twitter is no stranger to executive departures but at this moment it’s when the company is reeling from talks of an acquisition falling apart and the company having to figure out how to continue running as an independent company it also comes at a time when while the company was able to deliver some muchneeded solid results it laid off a significant portion of its workforce in october twitter had a severalmonth saga of trying to sell itself to a variety of suitors including salesforce which ultimately walked away from the talks in october shortly before the company reported its q results mcfarland meanwhile was vp of product for nine months and was at the company for around two years after twitter acquired tellapart that role has been an even more notorious roundrobin especially as twitter has tried to figure out how to make the service more attractive and continue to grow — and convince wall street that it can last as an independent company and the continued decline of twitter’s stock which the company very actively uses to attract and compensate talent isn’t helping either the company’s stock since dorsey took over a little more than a year ago has in particular not done well findthecompany

officer the man overseeing a system that processes a halfbillion tweets a day grew up in tiny summerville current population  the son of a forester and teacher in an eastern oregon farming community  miles north of la grande in seventh grade adam messinger’s parents bought him a commodore  – the rudimentary but beloved computer from the dawn of the pc era which became the inspiration for many a technology career messinger taught himself programming from books learning on his own or by trading tips with a friend later as a physics major at willamette university messinger found himself rewriting the software in physics labs over the summer and gravitated to a career in computing at tiny startups and big companies he joined twitter two years ago just as the company captured the public consciousness with its constant stream of usergenerated news emotion and entertainmenttoday at twitter’s headquarters in san francisco messinger oversees the technology that underlies the service and pursues a ridiculously ambitious goal reaching every person on earthstill a regular visitor to oregon messinger’s parents remain in eastern oregon and he was in hillsboro this week for a talk at intel messinger spoke with the oregonian about his roots in the northwest twitter’s connective power and portland’s tech ecosystem the conversation has been edited for clarityadam messinger age  title chief technology officer twitter hometown summerville ore education imbler high school one of  students in the class of  willamette university class of  majored in physics and computer science family wife mary powell a san francisco tax attorney whom he met at willamette they have to daughters sophia and penelopethe oregonian how does somebody come from smalltown rural eastern oregon and a liberal arts school in salem get to california and a top job at one of the tech industry’s hottest companiesadam messinger my parents were a nonnegligible part of that my dad has a master’s degree in forestry my mom before she had kids was a teacher they were foundational we traveled a lot even though we lived out there that made it possible for me to imagine iti loved growing up there but i always knew that i was going to end up getting a job in technology i went to willamette because it seemed like the best school for me in oregon i started there as a physics major i worked at a couple physics labs over the summer and i found myself rewriting their software all the time and i decided i would do that i’m very happy i have a physics degree it’s great training to thinkyou were at several different companies in the silicon valley early in your career and at oracle until you joined twitter about two years ago how did you find twitter and how did twitter find youi knew a board member at twitter his name is peter fenton he’s a partner at benchmark which is a big venture capital fund i live in san francisco proper and i was driving back from santa clara on a terrible commute on  and peter happened to call me during the commute which was a total weak moment and said you should come talk to us about twitterand i said i don’t know this oracle gig is a pretty good deal and he said come meet jack twitter cocreator jack dorsey and tell me what you think i met jack over at square a mobilepayments company dorsey runs actually and had a couple meetings and he convinced me to come basicallywhat was the selling point twitter in its early days had success beyond its means the site was not super reliable and we weren’t able to serve the customers’ demand that’s a unique spot for an engineer people want the product and all you have to do is actually deliver it if you think you know how to help with that you can show up contribute to that and it’s very likely going to be a successful outcome that’s a spot that has the engineers’ names written on it come and do this and the company will be successful if you do your job well then the whole product will be successful that’s basically the recruiting pitch that we usetwitter has this fascination in the general public what is life like thereright now we have a lot of mystique which is great it’s great for recruiting it’s great for brand awareness but the reality of a company is largely the same no matter what company it is we have our ups and downs as a company just like anyone there’s a lot of work and a lot of stuff that doesn’t work all of that stuff exists here just like it exists anywhere the visibility we do have… the downside honestly… is it induces a fair amount of anxiety when things go wrong here you know a lot of people will hear about itbut it also has an upside people feel pretty proud being part of the news cycle and being part of the information flow when you see things like twitter being used in the turkish protests last summer or something like that it’s cool it’s cool to be part of the news it certainly is motivating it’s a responsibilitywe’re not on the level of a real public utility but we’ve kind of come to think of ourselves as something like that we have a responsibility to our users to be fairly reliable because a lot of people use it for things that are really important to them large and smallyou may have seen it across the river from us in vancouver a woman livetweeted a fatal car wreck that turned out to involve her husbandthat was a tragic story oh my god on one level it’s interesting that she has this outlet i hope it was useful to her but on the other hand it’s just a really tragic story i can’t imagine being in her shoesyou and i first connected on twitter how do you use itfor most folks you want to have some mix of professional things and other things to make it an interesting twitter account it’s basically what i follow as well is people that i think have interesting taste and tweet interesting things that i want to read abouti try to keep the number that i follow at  which is a little mirror of twitter’s character limit i prune it often so that i’m at  it reflects what i’m interested in what i think is interesting old friends of coursethe reason i keep a ceiling on it is just by my nature what i want in my stream is a modest amount of highquality content the companies that have endured from the last tech boom the googles or the amazons have grown to become much more than they were in the dotcom era do you think the same thing might apply to the current tech boom what kind of company might twitter be five or  years from nowi’m sure you’re aware that we recently purchased a company called vine vine enables short online videos often embedded in tweets that repeat continuously i think we’re really pleased with the adoption of that it serves much of a similar use case to twitter for people who need to be connected want to be able to express yourself want to be able to find out some information i think vine skews a little bit more toward entertainment and not toward news one of the things about consumer internet unlike enterprise is that rather than having a long planning cycle companies tend to have a fast iteration cycle so projecting the future out five years is not the way we think about it here internally we think about it in terms of trying things and trying to put more fuel on the fire of things that are working we do have a few core values that we use to filter opportunities that come along one is reach every person on the planet technology can really be a force of good on earth which sounds kind of corny i know but we actually do believe it so one of the things that drives us is expanding our reach across the world another core value is to grow our business in a way that makes us proud by which we mean don’t do anything that you don’t want to tell your friends about or you don’t want to tell your mom about so we’ve tried to be really diligent in the way we’ve added advertising to the product i think we’ve done a good job in blending that in a way that doesn’t impact the customer experience negatively indeed some of our ads have higher engagement than our organic materialwe have those as our constitution so to speak and then are iterative from thereyou met your wife at willamette university what else do you take away from therewillamette was an important steppingstone for me in the following way when you grow up in a small town you’re not really sure if it’s possible for you to go beyond that you’re not sure if you’re going to go out in the real world and not going to have what it takeswhen i got there i said i know i’m from one of the smaller high schools here and i’m doing just fine this is working just fine beyond what you learn there’s this confidencebuilding part of that experience that’s probably equally important you start to think about you can actually make things happen in the world rather than just be part of things that are already happeningwe have this young aspirational tech community in portland what advice do you have for themfor good or ill the whole portland gestalt encourages lifestyle businesses it seems to me sometimes that people here are starting technology hardware stores the digital equivalent of the neighborhood hardware store they’re not all trying to start a metaphorical home depotthat’s a perfect analogy you start a hardware store you might make a great living but it’s not going to be a giant company on the one hand that guy’s probably really happy and has a great life and goes skiing every weekend and it’s awesome right should he do something else i don’t knowyou’ve got to make your own call on where you want to be on that axis and there are sacrifices either way if you want to have a giant company then there’s a lot of sacrificespeople work really hard in the bay area and it’s not like people don’t work hard in portland i don’t mean to say that at all but the lifework balance is skewed differently here than it is in portland here’s the funniest thing about it there’s this cognitive dissonance in the bay area where everyone talks about worklife balance and everyone thinks that other people have lifework balance but they find that no one does we not only don’t have lifework balance but we’re all in a state of perpetual cognitive dissonance and angst because of that whereas in portland it is a real thing for a lot of people and that’s great i’m not going to tell them to do anything elsewhere are you on that axisi struggle it’s a struggle every day engineers are in general not great at balancing things we like things to be either this way or that way  mike
