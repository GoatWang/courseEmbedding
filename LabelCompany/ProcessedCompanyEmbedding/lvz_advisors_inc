our story our philosophy why lvz preferred colleagues services money management business development marketing solutions  coaching resources contact advisor’s login our story dedicated to helping you grow we’ve used third party money managers in the past—and that’s why we’re dedicated to treating you like colleagues whose businesses we want to help grow not customers we keep at arm’s length here’s how we got where we are today founding a firm when john lorence opened the doors to our firm in  he started out like most others at the time selling mutual funds for a commission jim lorence followed his dad into business in  continuing to follow the industry standard jim also began utilizing level load investment products to provide a more predictable cash flow for the firm as time went on the need for a more efficient broadly diversified repeatable process became obvious jim began to delegate the daytoday business of investment management to third party money managers so he could focus on his clients’ comprehensive financial needs the business began to expand which led him to hire ryan vander zwart who eventually became a partner dealing with third party money managers while delegating money management responsibilities allowed jim and ryan to focus their efforts on the comprehensive financial needs of their clients they found that third party money managers lacked a number of qualities that were important to them their platform fees limited lvz’s profit margin their refusal to make any exceptions to account size minimums resulted in frustration and customization was out of the question as were inkind transfers of highly appreciated securities jim and ryan felt like they were being treated like just another asset gatherer in  the partners decided to bring investment management inhouse in order to provide their clients with money management services tailored for their unique needs jim and ryan hired a team of money management professionals including nate baumann who became the firm’s third partner in  collaborating with colleagues while we initially intended to offer investment management services exclusively to our own clients interest from other financial professionals regarding our investment advisory services became apparent as a result we obtained a national selling agreement with our own independent broker dealer to offer our third party money management services to a select group of colleagues today lvz advisors has grown to over  million in assets across multiple independent broker dealers we partner with likeminded colleagues who share our investment philosophy values and culture as we continue to grow we will also continue to evaluate the needs and desires of our preferred colleagues and their clients so we can provide the most

team our story our philosophy why lvz preferred colleagues services money management business development marketing solutions  coaching resources contact advisor’s login our philosophy asset allocation “there is always a market sector rising or falling at a greater rate than other sectors our objective is to increase investment in those sectors which are showing momentum and reduce our investment in those that are lagging” —jim lorence senior portfolio manager asset allocation manages risk in your portfolio our approach goes beyond the traditional diversification strategies of the past asset allocation is based on the proven theory that the type or class of security you own is much more important than the particular security itself or other factors risk is managed by building a portfolio of dissimilar classes of securities which will likely respond differently even inversely to market conditions asset allocation and diversification do not guarantee profit or protect against loss in a declining market they are methods used to help manage investment risk the lvz advisors philosophy is to take a proactive approach to this counterbalanced portfolio increasing allocations in the asset classes that show potential for better future performance while reducing allocations in asset classes and sectors that face the most resistance our flex position shifts from fully invested in equities to fully invested in fixed income depending on our market outlook scroll disclosures  lvz advisors about us our team our story our philosophy why lvz preferred colleagues services money
