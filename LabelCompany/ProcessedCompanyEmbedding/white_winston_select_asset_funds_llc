intercloud systems inc defendant united states district court d new jersey august   attorneys appearing for the case white winston select asset funds llc plaintiff represented by gregory joseph hindy  mccarter  english llp  mary y gabriel  mccarter  english intercloud systems inc defendant represented by eric donovan dowell  pryor cashman llp opinion freda l wolfson district judge this matter comes before the court upon a complaint filed by plaintiff white winston select asset funds llc wwsaf or plaintiff seeking damages against defendant intercloud systems inc intercloud or defendant for allegedly breaching contractual obligations between the two parties related to a financing arrangement in particular plaintiff asserts claims of  breach of contract  breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and  promissory estoppel defendant moves to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in that regard defendant argues that plaintiffs claims fail because there is no binding enforceable agreement between the parties for the following reasons defendants motion to dismiss is granted background in or about may  wwsaf and intercloud entered into negotiations regarding a proposed secured financing the financing whereby wwsaf would invest up to five million dollars in intercloud to be advanced towards redemption of outstanding shares of interclouds preferred stock and general working capital see complaint at ¶¶  on july   intercloud agreed to and accepted a term sheet prepared by wwsaf outlining the principal terms of the proposed secured financing id at  under the term sheet intercloud was to issue wwsaf a senior secured convertible debenture the debenture with a term of one year in the amount of five million dollars id at ¶  in that connection the particular provisions of the term sheet relevant to the present action are as follows first following the proposed offer and sale of interclouds common stock pursuant to a registration statement on form s the offering wwsaf would have the right to convert the debenture into shares of interclouds common stock at a premium price in the event that the offering did not close wwsaf would still have the right to convert the debenture into shares of interclouds common stock at fixed price id at ¶  second as a condition precedent to the financing wwsaf was required to enter into an intercreditor agreement with midmarket capital partners llc midmarket id at ¶  third the term sheet included a termination date that stipulated that the contemplated agreement between the parties shall terminate upon the earlier of the following a a date which is thirty days  after intercloud shall have provided wwsaf by written notice that it does not wish to proceed with the financing or b november   term sheet ¶  complaint ¶  the term sheet further provided that all obligations of the parties would be deemed null and void as of the termination date with the exception of sections d  and  term sheet ¶  complaint ¶  fourth and in relation to the termination date the term sheet contained a breakup fee provision in paragraph d which required intercloud to pay wwsaf if within  days of the termination date wwsaf was prepared to close the financing under substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the term sheet but intercloud failed to close with wwsaf because intercloud arranged financing through another source complaint ¶  in that event intercloud was required to pay wwsaf a breakup fee as follows i if intercloud closes the offering within such  day period then intercloud shall pay wwsaf the sum of   or ii if intercloud closes with any other lender investor or other party separate from a closing under the s registration within such  days then intercloud shall pay wwsaf     in the event both i and ii of the preceding sentence applies intercloud shall pay a breakup fee of  the breakup fee shall be immediately due and payable by intercloud to wwsaf term sheet at ¶ d additionally paragraphs  the reimbursement provision and  of the term sheet which also survived the termination date obligated intercloud to fully reimburse wwsaf for any and all legal or other expenses incurred by wwsaf in connection with the proposed financing as well as expenses incurred in the collection of amounts due to wwsaf pursuant to the term sheet if the proposed financing did not close complaint ¶¶  following the execution of the term sheet at all relevant times including through the termination date wwsaf was willing and prepared to close the financing under substantially the same terms and conditions as set forth in the term sheet id at ¶¶   indeed throughout the summer and fall of  wwsaf diligently prepared to close the financing by working in good faith with intercloud and neither intercloud nor wwsaf ever served written notice that either party did not wish to proceed with the financing id at ¶   on or about november   intercloud closed the offering triggering wwsafs rights under the term sheet id at ¶¶   however in september  and without wwsafs knowledge intercloud entered into an agreement with pnc bank na pnc which provided intercloud with a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to  the pnc facility id at ¶  the pnc facility which is secured by substantially all of interclouds assets and the assets of interclouds subsidiaries made it unnecessary for intercloud to close the financing with wwsaf id at ¶¶  in a parallel agreement intercloud entered into an amendment to its loan agreement with midmarket without informing wwsaf through which intercloud obtained midmarkets consent to grant pnc a senior security interest in interclouds assets id at ¶  interclouds amendment of its loan agreement with midmarket precluded wwsaf from entering into the intercreditor agreement with midmarket on the terms in the term sheet id at ¶  subsequently on or about december   intercloud completed the sale of convertible debentures within fortyfive days of the termination date without any involvement by wwsaf id at ¶¶  in other words interclouds agreement with pnc and the sale of debentures negated the contemplated financing with wwsaf id at ¶  because wwsaf was prepared to go through with the financing wwsaf demanded via letter dated november   from intercloud a breakup fee in the amount of  pursuant to the term sheet as a result of the closing of the offering on november   and an additional breakup fee in the amount of  as a result of interclouds consummation of the pnc facility the grant to pnc of a senior security interest in interclouds assets and the sale of its debentures id at ¶¶  in response intercloud by letter dated november   refused to pay any breakup fee id at ¶  thereafter wwsaf filed this action in december  asserting claims for breach of contract breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing and promissory estoppel intercloud subsequently filed the instant motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted ii standard of review when reviewing a motion to dismiss on the pleadings courts accept all factual allegations as true construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and determine whether under any reasonable reading of the complaint the plaintiff may be entitled to relief phillips v county of allegheny  fd   d cir  citation and quotations omitted in bell atlantic corp v twombly  us   the supreme court clarified the b standard the factual allegations set forth in a complaint must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level id at  as the third circuit has stated the supreme courts twombly formulation of the pleading standard can be summed up thus stating    a claim requires a complaint with enough factual matter taken as true to suggest the required element this does not impose a probability requirement at the pleading stage but instead simply calls for enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element phillips  fd at  quoting twombly  us at  see also covington v intl assn of approved basketball officials  fd   d cir  a claimant does not have to set out in detail the facts upon which he bases his claim    the pleading standard is not akin to a probability requirement    to survive a motion to dismiss a complaint merely has to state a plausible claim for relief citations omitted in affirming that twomblys standards apply to all motions to dismiss the supreme court explained several principles first the tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions ashcroft v iqbal  us    second only a complaint that states a plausible claim for relief survives a motion to dismiss id therefore a court considering a motion to dismiss can choose to begin by identifying pleadings that because they are no more than conclusions are not entitled to the assumption of truth id at  ultimately a complaint must do more than allege the plaintiffs entitlement to relief a complaint has to show such an entitlement with its facts fowler v upmc shadyside  fd   d cir  however a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings    although a limited exception exists for documents that are integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint w penn allegheny health sys inc v upmc  fd   n d cir  cert denied  sct   citation and internal quotation marks omitted iii discussion wwsafs complaint raises several claims arising from interclouds actions following the execution of the term sheet in count i wwsaf brings a breach of contract claim against intercloud asserting that the term sheet constitutes a binding enforceable agreement that intercloud breached id at ¶  within that claim wwsaf first asserts that the breakup fee as set forth in paragraph d of the term sheet survived the termination date as a valid and enforceable obligation id at ¶¶  wwsaf claims that because of interclouds agreement with pnc and the sale of the its debentures intercloud failed to close the financing with wwsaf id at ¶¶  as a result wwsaf claims that intercloud was and is required to pay wwsaf the  breakup fee which intercloud has failed and refused to do despite wwsafs demands id at  second wwsaf claims that intercloud failed to reimburse wwsaf for expenses pursuant to paragraph  of the term sheet id at ¶  specifically wwsaf contends that it incurred approximately  in expenses and that intercloud has breached its obligation to reimburse wwsaf for those expenses id at ¶¶  under count ii wwsaf avers that intercloud is also liable for breaching the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing id at ¶¶  in particular wwsaf claims that intercloud owed wwsaf an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing separate from interclouds obligations under the express terms of the term sheet and that the parties failed to close the financing as a result of interclouds failure to deal with wwsaf in good faith id at ¶¶  lastly in count iii wwsaf brings a promissory estoppel claim alleging that intercloud promised to reimburse wwsafs expenses and costs pursuant to paragraph  of the term sheet and that wwsaf reasonably relied upon this promise id at ¶¶  wwsaf argues that intercloud understood that this promise and others made in the term sheet would induce wwsaf to devote time and resources and take steps and incur significant costs to proceed with the financing with the expectation that the financing would close and that wwsaf would be reimbursed its expenses id at ¶  accordingly wwsaf claims that it has suffered losses as a result of interclouds failure and refusal to close the financing with wwsaf and that intercloud must reimburse wwsaf for the expenses incurred in connection with preparing for the financing id at ¶¶  intercloud moves to dismiss all of wwsafs claims pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as follows  wwsafs breach of contract claim must be dismissed because the term sheet is a nonbinding and unenforceable agreement  wwsafs claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing must be dismissed as duplicative of the breach of contract claim and  wwsafs claim for promissory estoppel must be dismissed as duplicative of the breach of contract claim i address each of these arguments in turn a breach of contract claim to state a claim in federal court for breach of contract under new york law a complaint need only allege  the existence of an agreement  adequate performance of the contract by the plaintiff  breach of contract by the defendant and  damages harsco corp v segui  fd   d cir  the words employed in the agreement must be given their plain meaning and the agreement must be construed to accord a meaning and purpose to each of its parts eqt infrastructure ltd v smith  fsuppd   sdny  quoting siebel v mcgrady  nysd   d dept  internal quotation marks omitted because the parties agree that they did not execute any final agreement for the financing the issue is whether the term sheet constitutes a binding preliminary agreement parties to proposed commercial transactions often enter into preliminary agreements which may provide for the execution of more formal agreements adjustrite sys inc v gab bus serv inc  fd   d cir  when they do so and the parties fail to execute a more formal agreement the issue arises as to whether the preliminary agreement is a binding contract or an unenforceable agreement to agree id here the parties dispute the enforceability of the breakup fee and the reimbursement provision in the term sheet plaintiff asserts that the term sheet was an enforceable preliminary agreement while defendant argues that the term sheet was an unenforceable agreement to agree under new york law ordinarily where the parties contemplate further negotiations and the execution of a formal instrument a preliminary agreement does not create a binding contract adjustrite sys inc at  however in some circumstances    preliminary agreements can create binding obligations id the extent of the obligations created depends on the preliminary agreement in question though in general binding preliminary agreements fall into one of two categories brown v cara  fd   d cir  quoting adjustrite sys inc  fd at  the first type of preliminary agreement type i occurs when the parties have reached complete agreement including the agreement to be bound on all the issues perceived to require negotiation teachers ins  annuity assn of am v tribune co  fsupp   sdny  such an agreement is preliminary only in form—only in the sense that the parties desire a more elaborate formalization of the agreement id adjustrite sys inc  fd at  therefore a type i preliminary agreement binds both sides to their ultimate contractual objective in recognition that despite the anticipation of further formalities a contract has been reached adjustrite sys inc  fd at  quoting tribune co  f supp at  see brown  fd at  the hallmark of a type i agreement is that the parties have agreed to all necessary elements of the contract and are therefore bound to the ultimate objective despite the fact that a more formal or elaborate writing has yet to be produced consequently a party may lawfully demand performance of the transaction even if no further steps have been taken following the making of the preliminary agreement tribune co  f supp at  adjustrite sys inc  fd at  the second type of preliminary agreement—sometimes called a preliminary commitment—recognized by new york courts type ii is binding only to a certain degree in that it expresses mutual commitment to a contract on agreed major terms while recognizing the existence of open terms that remain to be negotiated adjustrite sys inc  fd at  tribune co  f supp at  unlike type i preliminary agreements type ii preliminary commitments only obligate the parties to negotiate the open issues in good faith in an attempt to reach the alternate objective within the agreed framework tribune co  f supp at  thus where a type ii preliminary commitment exists a party may lawfully demand that his counterparty negotiate the open terms in good faith toward a final contract incorporating the agreed terms id in sum type ii preliminary agreements do not commit the parties to their ultimate contractual objective and merely require the parties to negotiate in good faith adjustrite sys inc  fd at  tribune co  f supp at  explaining that the obligation to negotiate in good faith bars a party from renouncing the deal abandoning the negotiations or insisting on conditions that do not conform to the preliminary agreement here the parties agree that the term sheet was not a type i preliminary agreement see pl opp  however plaintiff argues that the term sheet was a type ii preliminary commitment that obligated the parties to negotiate in good faith in that regard plaintiff contends that defendant failed to negotiate in good faith and as a result that defendant is required pay the breakup fee and reimburse plaintiff for expenses incurred in preparation for the financing see id at  plaintiff argues that while the ultimate goal of financing was a nonbinding provision the breakup fee provision in paragraph d of the term sheet was a binding obligation in the preliminary agreement in that regard plaintiff relies on the courts opinion in fcs advisors inc v fair finance co civ no   wl  sdny may   for the proposition that contracts may include both binding and nonbinding parts in general new york courts look to five factors when considering whether a type ii preliminary agreement exists  whether the intent to be bound is revealed by the language of the agreement  the context of the negotiations  the existence of open terms  partial performance and  the necessity of putting the agreement in final form as indicated by the customary form of such transactions brown v cara  fd at  tribune co  fsupp  arcadian phosphates inc v arcadian corp  fd   d cir  furthermore in determining whether a type ii agreement exists the intention of the parties as revealed by the language of the agreement is of primary importance adjustrite sys inc  fd at  eqt infrastructure ltd v smith  fsuppd   sdny  the first factor the intent to be bound as evidenced by the language of a preliminary agreement is the most important thus if the language of the agreement is clear that the parties did not intend to be bound the court need look no further singer v xipto inc  fsuppd   sdny  quoting cohen v lehman bros bank  fsuppd   sdny  see beekman inv partners lp civ no   wl  at  sdny feb   holding type ii preliminary agreement did not exist where memorandum of intent included clear expression of intent not to be bound network enterprises inc v apba offshore prod  fsuppd   sdny  the obligation to negotiate in good faith that a type ii preliminary agreement would otherwise impose upon a party may of course be negated by a sufficiently clear expression that the parties are not bound to each other in any way until a formal written contract is executed by both in this case a plain reading of the disclaimer language in the term sheet evidences a clear intent not to be bound in fact the parties explicitly stated their intention not to be bound by the term sheet in the disclaimer provision this term sheet is intended for use only as the basis for continued discussion between the company and the investor and does not constitute a commitment letter an agreement to enter into a commitment letter or an offer to enter into a commitment letter and shall not be deemed to obligate the investor its affiliates partners or principals to close the financing under any terms or circumstances term sheet at  additionally the term sheet specifically contemplates continued discussions between the company and investor and the parties recognized that the term sheet served as a mere summary of the principal terms of a proposed secured financing term sheet at   emphasis added finally the term sheet in this case is clearly distinguishable from the letter of intent in fcs advisors in fcs advisors the letter of intent expressly provided that it was not a legally binding contract except for sections  through  fcs advisors inc  wl  at  emphasis added conversely here neither the reimbursement provision nor the breakup fee contain explicit language stating that those provisions were binding or otherwise enforceable accordingly this court finds that the term sheet as a whole was not a type ii preliminary commitment and thus plaintiff cannot obligate defendant to any of the provisions in the term sheet including the breakup fee provision cf id even assuming arguendo that the term sheet could be interpreted as a type ii preliminary agreement this would still not permit plaintiff to impose the breakup fee obligation on defendant as explained above the sole obligation that arises under a type ii preliminary agreement is the obligation between the parties defendant to negotiate in good faith adjustrite sys inc  fd at  explaining that type ii preliminary agreements do not commit the parties any ultimate contractual objective and merely require the parties to negotiate in good faith thus even assuming that defendant was obligated but failed to negotiate in good faith plaintiffs argument that the penalty for defendants breach of that obligation is found in the nonbinding term sheet is not supported by law or reason see id put differently plaintiff cannot argue as it does on the one hand that the term sheet as a whole was nonbinding—and significantly nowhere contained any language regarding specific provisions being binding—but that defendants failure to negotiate in good faith triggered the breakup feereimbursement provisions plaintiffs argument taken to its logical end would eviscerate the difference between preliminary binding and nonbinding agreements established under new york law as it would allow a party to get the benefit of selectively enforcing an otherwise nonbinding provision to the detriment of the other party in sum under the term sheet plaintiff only had to the right to demand that defendant negotiate the terms of the financing in good faith and did not obligate defendant to any specific term or provision including the breakup fee and reimbursement provision see bear stearns inv prod inc v hitachi auto prod usa inc  br   sdny  accordingly because there is no enforceable agreement in this case plaintiffs breach of contract claim is dismissed b duty of good faith and fair dealing in count ii plaintiff brings a claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing arguing that defendant owed plaintiff duties separate and independent from those under the breach of contract claim and that plaintiff violated those duties first plaintiff claims that the breakup fee expressly provided that defendant would be liable to plaintiff for entering into another financing arrangement within  days of the termination date and that defendant did enter into such agreements while plaintiff was performing its due diligence second plaintiff cites several acts of defendant that were allegedly made in bad faith including defendants failure to disclose to plaintiff the intended sale of its debentures defendants failure to disclose its negotiations with midmarket and other acts of defendant allegedly undertaken in secrecy and intentionally withheld from plaintiff in response defendant argues that plaintiffs cause of action for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing must be dismissed because the term sheet was not a binding contract and defendants alleged conduct is not separate from plaintiffs breach of contract claim defendant asserts that new york law does not recognize a separate cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when a breach of contract claim based upon the same facts is also pled def br  in sum defendant argues that plaintiffs claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is duplicative of the breach of contract claim and as a result must be dismissed there is implicit in all contracts    an implied covenant of fair dealing and good faith van walkenburgh nooger  neville inc v hayden publg co  nyd    see dalton v educ testing serv  nyd    integral to a finding of a breach of the implied covenant is a partys action that directly violates an obligation that may be presumed to have been intended by the parties macom sec corp v galesi  fd   d cir  thus a claimants breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim must arise out of an agreement between the parties see bank of ny v sasson  fsupp   sdny  the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is limited to performance under a contract and does not encompass future dealings or negotiations between the parties broder v cablevision sys corp  fd   d cir  the implied covenant can only impose an obligation consistent with other mutually agreed upon terms in the contract citations omitted accordingly the implied covenant does not add    to the contract a substantive provision not included by the parties broder  fd at  quoting green v quantum chem corp  fsupp   sdny  i have already found that the term sheet is not a binding preliminary agreement and thus plaintiffs implied covenant claim fails for lack of a valid and binding contract from which such a duty would arise fcof ub securities v morequity inc  fsuppd   sdny  applying new york law see also beekman inv partners lp v alene candles inc civ no  civ   wl  at  sdny feb   a cause of action for breach of an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing    is properly dismissed for lack of a valid and binding contract from which such a duty would arise americaneuropean art assocs inc v trend galleries inc  add   nysd   st dept  accordingly plaintiffs claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing claim is dismissed c promissory estoppel in count iii plaintiff brings a claim for promissory estoppel in that connection plaintiff argues that defendant made a clear and definite promise to reimburse plaintiff for the expenses incurred in preparation for the financing furthermore plaintiff alleges that defendant understood that this promise would induce wwsaf to devote time and resources and take steps and incur significant costs to proceed with the financing with the expectation that the financing would close and wwsaf would be reimbursed for its expenses complaint at ¶  plaintiff claims that defendant neither closed the financing nor reimbursed plaintiff and as a result plaintiff has suffered damages in response defendant argues that while plaintiff may be able to plead a claim for promissory estoppel in the alternative here plaintiffs claim must be denied because the underlying basis for the claim is dependent on the term sheet in that regard defendant argues that plaintiff has failed to allege any duties independent of the term sheet and therefore plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim must be dismissed as redundant of the breach of contract claim a cause of action for promissory estoppel under new york law requires the plaintiff to prove three elements  a clear and unambiguous promise  reasonable and foreseeable reliance on that promise and  injury to the relying party as a result of the reliance kaye v grossman  fd   d cir  see readco inc v marine midland bank  fd   d cir because it is a quasicontractual claim however promissory estoppel generally applies only in the absence of a valid and enforceable contract kwon v yun  fsuppd   sdny  in this case having determined that the term sheet is not a valid and enforceable contract the issue is whether plaintiff has adequately pled the elements for promissory estoppel review of the complaint reveals that plaintiffs promissory estoppel claim must be dismissed plaintiffs claim is based solely on the provisions set forth within the term sheet as noted above the disclaimer language at the end of the term sheet clearly evinces that all promises and provisions within the term sheet were contingent upon the signing of a future contract thus plaintiff could not reasonably rely on the term sheet as an unambiguous promise in support of a promissory estoppel claim see eg reprosystem bv v scm corp  fd   d cir  dismissing promissory estoppel claim for lack of a clear and unambiguous promise where the negotiations of the parties as reflected in the draft agreements made it clear that the obligations of both scm and muller were contingent upon execution    of the formal contract documents rg group inc v horn  hardart co  fd   d cir  holding that because the parties negotiations made it clear that any promise or agreement was conditional upon the signing of a written contract there was never a clear or unambiguous promise frutico sa de cv itex inc v bankers trust co  fsupp   sdny  plaintiff does not allege any duties on defendant that are independent of the term sheet and thus as pled plaintiff fails to state a claim for promissory estoppel claim accordingly count iii of the complaint is dismissed conclusion for the foregoing reasons the court determines that plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted in all counts of the complaint the court therefore grants defendants motion to dismiss footnotes  in reviewing this motion to dismiss factual allegations are taken from plaintiffs complaint and those  in reviewing this motion to dismiss of actual allegations are taken from plaintiffs exhibits attached to the complaint including the term sheet discussed herein and are assumed to be true pension benefit guar corp v white consol indus  fd   d cir  noting that on motion to dismiss court may consider undisputedly authentic documents that relate to the claims in the complaint  at the time the term sheet was drafted wwsaf had already entered into discussions with midmarket and had obtained midmarkets agreement in principal to the terms of the intercreditor agreement prior to interclouds acceptance of the term sheet id at ¶  intercloud was aware of the negotiations between wwsaf and midmarket and intercloud had also obtained midmarkets agreement in principal to the terms of the intercreditor agreement prior to executing the term sheet id at ¶¶   the parties agreed that the term sheet would be governed by new york law see term sheet ¶   moreover plaintiffs implied covenant claim must be dismissed even if arguendo the term sheet constitutes a binding agreement new york law does not recognize a separate cause of action for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing when a breach of contract claim based upon the same facts is also pled harris v provident life and accident ins co  fd   d cir  it is clear from the complaint that plaintiffs claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is based on the same predicate facts underlying plaintiffs breach of contract claim although plaintiff contends that defendant owed plaintiff an implied duty separate and independent of defendants obligations under the term sheet this aspect of plaintiffs claim is pled in a conclusory fashion with no additional facts to substantiate it accordingly even assuming that the term sheet constitutes a binding preliminary agreement— which for the reasons above i find that it does not—i would nevertheless dismiss plaintiffs claim for breach of the implied duty of good faith as being duplicative of its contract claim see in re houbigant inc v acb mercantile inc  fsupp   sdny  explaining that claim for breach of the implied covenant will be dismissed as redundant where the conduct allegedly violating the implied covenant is also the predicate for a claim for breach of covenant of an express provision of the underlying contract  for this reason defendants contention that plaintiffs promi ssory estoppel claim must be dismissed as duplicative of the breach of contract
