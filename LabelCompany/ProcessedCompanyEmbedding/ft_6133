 x  ft with deluxe awning canopy  camp in comfort and style with this premium cabin tent from kodiak canvas keep dry in these tents made with premium grade hydrashield  cotton duck canvas the tight weave and silicone finish makes this canvas watertight yet breathable minimizing condensation and mugginess tarp option the   by  tarp is the perfect size for this tent and is included in the displayed price for this tent it adds an additional layer of protection to help increase the durability of your tent the tarp can be removed for a  discount if necessary the tarp and the tent will ship in separate boxesenclosure option one of the neatest features of this tent is that it has the ability to turn the deluxe awning into a wall or screen enclosure the wall enclosure zips onto the edges of the awning and completely encloses the covered area essentially adding another  feet to your tent the screen enclosure is similar to the wall enclosure in that it zips to the awning and encloses the covered area instead of canvas walls like the wall enclosure the screen enclosure is made up of fine mesh which allows you to enjoy the view but stay safe from insects and such the wall and tent enclosures are offered at a great promotion price of  with the tent compared to the  separate price the enclosures can be purchased and added on at a later date note the enclosures do not include a floor the  ground tarp is closest to the correct size but it is not a perfect fit and can be purchased separately pole bag option this tent already includes a place for the poles however due to the size and weight of the tent many campers find it easier to carry the poles in a separate bag this extra pole bag is the correct size to carry the tent poles in other waterproof tents will easily become hot and humid inside making them very uncomfortable but not so with kodiak canvas tents storm flaps are on the outside and zip up from the outside go ahead and touch the inside walls

only issue  no door screen on awning side door the pole bag has a hole in it from shipping needs replacing anyone who goes camping often should own this tent everything about it is heavy duty made to last like the hanger loops inside the floor is super heavy duty vinyl  the tent pegs are the best ive seen i used to use large spike nails and still do with the other tents i own these meet those standards and then some the awning is a must the side doorwindow screen should zip down center and to the sides instead of from bottom up and out minor details but heeding the advice of the end user in your design could make the product even better i would pay for the up grades did you find this helpful   of  found helpful reviewed by customer from antonio tx on    x  tent we bought one of these

just spent  nights in high desert south east of tucson loved the tents large size and the awning did you find this helpful   of  found helpful reviewed by steve from tucson az on   great tent we spent a lot of time looking for a canvas tent this is it we took it to the mountains of north carolina during thanksgiving cold outside warmer on the inside the x vestibule was nice but i would suggest a small modification to extend the vertical lines of the optional enclosure along the tent edge in lieu of straight down we used a tarp to configure this and it gave us just a few inches extra that were not available with the enclosure this added more storage under our table and a bit more room for cooking the head room made it appear bigger than our  x  tent we had to replace excellent choice if you want a sturdy well constructed base tent did you find this helpful   of  found helpful reviewed by me from st pete on   view all qa q im interested in purchasing this tent but its so doggone heavy

circumstances much appreciated asked by greg malone   a these canvas tents have been tested up to  mph though we do not recommend camping in such extreme weather if the wind gets bad enough regardless of the tent or brand name your poles will simply bend replacement parts are available it does take incredible storms to damage these tents nylon tents can be damaged in storms with wind gusts of  miles per hour these are double that or more was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin  submit an answer q do the cabin tents hold up as well in strong wind as the spring bar tent asked by rob   a one of the nice things about the cabin tent is that it holds up to wind exceptionally well most customers in most environments will never need to use guy ropes to help stabilize it in a rough windstorm however if you decide to there are plenty of places you can tie rope to give it some extra stability it comes with guy ropes for the awnings

be redesigning i would like to purchase this tent but i need the doors to zip entirely closed  asked by kathy   a the screen zips closed entirely and the cover zips on the two sides with a velcro closure on the bottom this does not make it vulnerable to squirrels etc was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  customer service  submit an answer q amp  to  weeks of the year is that going to void the warranty it certainly doesnt seem like extended camping to me according to my understanding the wall stakes are considerably lighter duty than the tent stakes and if i upgrade i have to pay for it in the first place it doesnt make any sense to me that they would be lighter i was wondering if you would upgrade the wall steaks at no charge with my purchase id like to be a long long term customer for practical well run business thank yo asked by kathy   a more than three weeks is considered extended use the tent should still hold up fine but it is extended use and would not be covered under the warranty the wall stakes are considerably lighter duty than those  stakes to protect the tent in the event of a crazy windstorm you do not want that enclosure to tear where it attaches to the tent its best to let the wind in a worstcase scenario pull up the awning as opposed to tear the awning from the tent itself there are some crazy windstorms it is the same with the vestibule it intentionally has thinks that generally allow it to be pulled out of the ground in the event of extreme wind if you do upgrade the stakes keep that in mind was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q what are the dimensions of the wall enclosure i am trying to figure out whether this tent with the wall enclosure would fit on a  by  foot platform thanks asked by kevin   a it definitely would not fit on a  x  platform since the tent is  x  and the awning is  feet giving your

 pm submit an answer q i am concerned this tent might be too heavy for me to carry around how many bags does it include asked by camper   a the great thing about this tent is that it has two bags rather than carrying all the poles and tent body in one bag they are separate so that the average adult can manage them without any problems one thing i like to do is separate the awning poles into their own bag as there are times when you might set up the tent without wanting the awning up it is an amazing tent and will surprise and impress you with how much room is inside was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q what tent is the best one for hunting for a week at a time asked by camper   a  this tent is definitely one of our favorites for hunters and heres why many campers bring a lot of gear and sometimes animals when they go hunting the deluxe awning attachment provides plenty of space for putting extra gear animals and equipment hunters also will often go in groups for more than just one night this tent is great if youre putting it up for a week or so as well the height is   feet inside and allows you plenty of room for was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q which tent is your best tent for tall people asked by camper   a  model  cabin tent is definitely the best for tall people we have other sizes to accommodate all shapes and sizes model  for example is just  feet tall but this one is   feet tall it is not only nice for tall people but it feels very roomy for those who may not like cramped spaces so feel free to wake up in the morning and to stand up to stretch tall was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q if i want to put an electric blanket or stereo is there a way to run an extension cord into the tent asked by camper   a yes this tent actually has its own little opening that zips to accommodate an extension cord the opening is located on the bottom left of the front of the tent it zips closed when not in use and also zips tight when the cord is moving through it it takes camping to another level allowing you to power electric blankets and other electronics was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q will i be able to fill a breeze with the windows closed asked by camper   a yes you will absolutely be able to feel breeze that is one of the huge benefits of this tent there are large windows on every side of the tentand they are large the nice thing about the windows is that it not only allows you to feel the breeze but it allows you to enjoy the scenery around your camping area one thing to keep in mind is that the window on the left sidea very large windowcan only be opened while the awning is set up when the awning is put down the window is closed the awning is actually the cover to close the window itself was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  a no you will not feel a breeze with the windows closed but the tent fabric breathes so you will still feel comfortable was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  nelson  submit an answer q can i purchase a separate bag for just the awning poles since i dont have to set them up each time with the tent asked by camper   a yes you sure can you can order it online however you would need to order it over the phone was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q can i sleep other people underneath the awning asked by camper   a yes you can that is one reason many people by this sometimes people get this particular tent because they realize sometimes they will be camping with just a few people and other times with many more if you go camping with just a handful of people are usually able to fit the main tent room if you need extra room simply open the awning and set it up place down the tarp and put up the wall enclosure and you are set when you use the awning to sleep more people you can simply leave the tent door open not the door but the tent door and it feels like one large open area was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q it looks like there are two awnings included looks like a smaller awning also functions as the door flap how does that work asked by camper   a there are two awningsone is that the deluxe awning and the other is the regular awning it includes them both in fact they are both sewn on and not detachable the larger awning and smaller on in both our optional when you set up the tent you dont have to set them up if you dont want to the smaller awning does also function as the door closing flap for the large door on the left side it zips closed on the left and right sides and velcros on the bottom it is water tight the larger awning does not act as a closing flap for a door  it is a standalone awning was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q is there a way to clean off tree sap asked by camper   a yes and no some trees that is very unforgiving and is not come off without a lot of work do not use soap on the tent the only way to clean this is with water and a paper towel rag or a material that can help scrub it off without being abrasive and damaging the canvas in most cases you can simply spray the tent with the garden hose for several minutes to get most of it off as with any tent you may find that it does not come completely off it may fade over time and in some cases the cold weather will allow it to break off cleanly was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q can i set this up and leave it up all summer long asked by camper   a you definitely do not want to set this up all year were all summer there are some businesses that will do just that knowing that they will need to replace it every year please keep in mind that the care instructions that come with the owners manual explained that this is not designed for extended longterm use for an entire season it is a tent designed for fun family camping that will last a lifetime camping generally consists of a few weeks earlierand overnighter here and thereor hunting trip that can last couple weeks was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q is this one of those glamorous camping tents glamping asked by camper   a you may be surprised to know that many organizations including glamour camping businesses purchase this very tents the majority of those are probably in hawaii they set these up for tourists to have a glamorous camping experience they set them up on wooden bases or decks and create a canopy over the tents to prolong the life of the tent because you can run electricity into the tent through the outlet opening it can make it a great environment creating a nice breeze complete with electric blanket and alarm clock if you decide to do this with your tent please keep in mind the warranty does not cover permanent or extended use the tents last a long time but they are not designed to be permanent living quarters was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q will this tent mold asked by camper   a this tent will definitely not mold if taken care of properly the customers we have with mold issues almost always have one thing in commonthey got rained on during camping rolled the tent up and stored it away wet unrolled it several weeks later only to find mold that doesnt happen very often but it is  preventable camping often involves rain hail and even snow the tent can withstand the moisture you should not get a drop inside the tent however once you get home you need to set it up or lay it out without delay to allow it to dry it may be raining outside when you get home so you will want to find a location such as a garage or some location with an environment that is dry and will allow the tent to breathe and dry was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q are these tents fire retardant asked by camper   a the kodiak canvas tents are not fire retardants we urge you to be extra cautious keeping anything flammable safe distance away to keep you and your family safe make sure that you never set the tent up next to a campfire cooking area or any area where the tent could start on fire it is not recommended to use heaters inside the tent for safety and liability purposes was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q can i put a heater inside this tent can i put fire wood heater in asked by camper   a this is a very common question people want to be warm and dry when they are camping these tents will definitely keep you dry and they keep heat in better than nylon tents but we do not recommend heaters the tent can withstand the cold winters of alaska and the arizona sun but heaters create a danger of creating a fire we dont want anybody to be injured or hurt please note that adding a wood burning stove voids the warranty and is not recommended modifying the tent in any way voids the warranty was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q how often do i need to reseason the tent asked by camper   a kodiak tens have whats called a dry treated seasoning meaning you dont have that old waxy feeling that gets brittle and gooey depending on the temperature it is immersed and rolled in the water proofing liquid during the manufacturing process most customers will never need to retreat the tent it all depends on how often you use it some customers will camp a day or two here and there while others will camp weeks at a time even the most avid longterm campers do not need to treat the tent often in most cases you can get away with treating it every four or five years and thats after spraying water on it to see if there are any spots allowing water inside when testing it simply spray it with a garden hose using decent pressurehit all the seams thoroughly should water into the tent simply find the spot treat it with a canvas tent waterproofing spray let it dry spray again with water to test it out and you should be set was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q what is the difference between this tent and model number  asked by camper   a thats a great question and very common there are only two main differences between the two tents model  is simply the basic version of the cabin tent model  is the deluxe version with the massive awning thats the difference model  does have an awning but it does not have a large deluxe awning model  has the basic awning same as model  but also has an additional deluxe awning a total of two awnings if you decide to purchase model  please keep in mind that the awning cannot be purchased afterwards the reason being it is sewn onto the tent during the manufacturing process so model  has that deluxe awning sewn onto it was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q is this your largest cabin tent asked by camper   a yes this is definitely our largest cabin tent there is an older model called the grand cabin that was larger but it was discontinued this cabin tent is  feet wide by  feet deep and includes an  foot awning that is a half feet long by   feet deep was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q what is the difference between a cabin tent and a flex bow tent asked by camper   a there is one major difference between the cabin tent and the flex bow tent and that is the assembly time the flex bow tents can be assembled in about five minutes whereas the cabin tents take about  to  minutes both styles are fairly quick to set up it becomes quicker each time you set it up as well the other difference is the slope of the walls and the height of the tent the cabin tent is the tallest with a peak of   feet the walls are almost completely vertical the cabin style is considered to be a more deluxe wave camping however most customers choose to go with the flex bow style because it is very quick to set up the cabin tent can be set up by one person but the first time you set it up you would probably want a second person there its difficult to explain without a video feel free to check out our video that shows one person assembling the tent and the awning was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q do i need to use guy ropes to secure the tent asked by camper   a you do need to use guy ropes to secure the basic awning guy ropes are recommended for the deluxe awning as well one of the nice things about the cabin tent is that it holds up to wind exceptionally well most customers in most environments will never need to use guy ropes to help stabilize it in a rough windstorm however if you decide to there are plenty of places you can tie rope to give it some extra stability it comes with guy ropes for the awnings replacement guy ropes can be purchased separately was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q how do i wash the tent do i use soap asked by camper   a cleaning these tents is very simple im in charge of our boy scout troops tend maintenance which means every time you have a camp out they bring the tents to my home i set them up i clean it off and i repair any damage somehow boy scouts find a way to damage about anything i have found that the best thing to do is simply set up the tent and spray it with a pressurized hose not a pressurized washer before doing that i sweep it off with a kitchen broom to get any bird droppings pine needles and loose dirt off the tent i then sprayed for about  minutes i have learned that doing this can be a little bit deceiving as your spring the tent with the hose it will look like it is doing absolutely no good it will look like the dirt is not coming off and you are wasting time somehow each time i have done this by the time the tent is dry almost any stain or dirt spot disappears for some reason while it is wet every bit of dirt seems to show up a little bit better just be patient and most of it if not all of it will be gone by the time it dries cleaning the interior is done the same way please never use soap on these tents it can undo the waterproofing technology and damage the tent do not use soap on the floor either and especially do not use any type of abrasive cloth on the floor as it will take off the beautiful look tree sap is a little bit difficult to get off and i have found that it takes months before it starts to disappear the stains may never come out but they really dont look bad it just looks like a good tent that has been on a lot of camping adventures was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q how can a clean dirt from the inside of the tent can i use soap on the floor asked by camper   a hes never never never use soap on these tents you might be tempted to use soap especially on the floor soap could leak into this seems on the sides of the tent and undo the waterproofing technology if you need to clean the floor you can simply spray it with water let it soak for a few minutes and then mop it up like you would a floor with an actual mop or with towels be sure to never use an abrasive material to scrub the floor the floor has a subtle shine and texture that gives you a little bit of traction when you walk on it an abrasive material would scratch that and make it look different than the rest of the floor in most cases you can simply sweep the floorno need to wipe it down was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q does the cabin tent have airflow vents at the top asked by camper   a the cabin tent does not haveneed airflow vents the cabin tents provide some of the best ventilation of all of our tents there are windows on each side to provide a gentle breeze from any direction the tents breathe very well generally customers that need a little bit of airflow will simply unzip the top of the window a few inchesjust enough to let airflow in and out according to your desire the windows have two zippers so you can manipulate the shape of the opening to some degree the models that do have airflow vents are considered flexible tents and not cabin tents was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q which ground tarp is the appropriate tarp for the tent and the appropriate tarp for the awning asked by camper   a the appropriate ground hard for the model s model   is a  x  ground tarp and is designed to fit the footprint of the bottom of the tent some customers want to put a floor down underneath the awning however if you decide to do that we do not carry a tarp that is a perfect match the footprint is  x  the closest heart we would have would be the  x  tarp you would simply need to roll the edges to fit the footprint was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  charley hansen  submit an answer q does the cabin tent have a gear loft option asked by camper   a no you can purchase pocket organizers separately however was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q do you have any tips on how to keep the inside floor clean asked by camper   a the flooring is a thick vinyl material this type of material is easy to wipe clean with a wet rag you can also easily sweep up dirt and other debris with a small camping broom and dust pan was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q what is the material of the floor is it like a glorified tarp asked by camper   a no the vinyl material used on the floor of these tents is much thicker and more durable than a tarp was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q which tent would be the best fit for a family of four asked by camper   a a  person tent option would be model  however if you are wanting more space for gear storage and sleeping arrangements you can also take a look at the x and x models please see model   vx  and  was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q what is the benefit of having canvas versus nylon asked by camper   a canvas is much heavier and more durable than nylon canvas tents when taken care of have a much longer life span was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q do i need to use the tarp what if its raining asked by camper   a a rain fly is not necessary for these tents after seasoning the tent wetting it down lightly with water and allowing the tent to dry completely you do not initially need to do anything else for the tent to be water tight your owners manual will also provide long term care instructions for your tent was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q does this come with a rain fly asked by camper   a no a rain fly is not necessary seasoning the tent per the handling instructions in your owners manual should be sufficient for water needs was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  sean peterson  submit an answer q what kind of canvas is this tent asked by camper   a the canvas is high industry standard cotton duck canvas the water rose off like the back of a duck that includes kodiaks hydrashield technology it is a dry treated canvas so it does not get brittle in the cold or oily in the extreme heat was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q how does this tent compare to spring bar asked by camper   a spring bar makes a fantastic tent it is only second to one and that is the kodiak brand in an independent lab test kodiak tested approximately  stronger as far as the canvas goes kodiak uses a heavy duty for that is almost twice the thickness and weight and it has a welded seam spring bar has a thin floor and a sewn seam which can lead to water leakage kodiak has a superior screen that is much stronger than spring bar both use the same zippers and assemble similarly was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q is this a wall tent what is the difference asked by camper   a these are considered cabin tents wall tents have vertical walls like this but they generally dont have the floor there are many will tents that are canvas like the kodiak models and some even include a way to heat it through a wood burning stove these cabin tents all include floors was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q is it possible to use the privacy vestibule on this asked by camper   a some customers do use the privacy vestibule but it is not designed for that that is it will not fit perfectly but it will be a close fit the vestibules are designed for the flex bow models and not the cabin models they are designed specifically for models number  vx       and  was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q do most people get the wall enclosure or the screen enclosure which is better asked by camper   a no question about it most customers purchase the wall enclosure and not the screen enclosure some customers will purchase both however the wall enclosure has six large screened windows in other words it kind of acts as a screen enclosure or a wall enclosure depending on whether you keep the windows opened or closed was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q can i use this tent is an emergency preparedness type of tent asked by camper   a absolutely many customers who are emergency prepared enthusiasts buy this tent in fact there was a huge demand for canvas tents in recent disasters including the earthquake in haiti many kodiak tents were used for temporary shelters was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q will i feel too crammed if i take my hunting buddies with me how many people does this really hold asked by camper   a that is a great question and it is difficult to answer without mentioning some specific items this is officially a six person tent but if you have six people using extra large cots you are going to fill crammed if you are going to have a lot of gear it is more like a four person tent this particular tent is popular for hunters because there is the deluxe  awning where you can store gear and keep it protected from the elements if you use the wall enclosure this tent is definitely number one when it comes to our elk hunting customers was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q were looking for a temporary shelter for the summer to use for missionary service will this tent work for that asked by camper   a yes and no this tent is designed for the elements but not necessarily extended use having said that we do get some customersespecially in the tropics that will live in these or rent these out for a business in extended use circumstances to be fair they often dont leave it out in the sun but they will leave it underneath some other type of structure such as an awning canopy or even have some type of tarps hung over it to protected from extended sunshine in those cases you can often get years of use there is a local sporting goods store here in utah that has had one out since the beginning of the year and it still looks beautiful it is their display model and i think everyone is a little surprise that it has been able to last for most of one complete year please note that it does void the warranty if you are using it in extended use circumstances was this answer helpful   of  customers found this answer helpful answer provided by  admin   pm submit an answer q we have started a business for deluxe camping which is the best tent to give our customers the best experience asked by camper   a glamping glamour camping seems to be a big trend and there is even an outfit in bear lake utah that seems to be doing pretty well we have some customers in tropical climates such as hawaii and some in colder climates such as alaska that will use this tent to rent out to customers it is designed to give them a deluxe camping experience with some of the luxuries and pleasures of our contemporary lifestyles please note that the warranty does not cover extended use many of these companies simply understand that they will need to replace them every

below worth every ounce posted by unknown on th jul  first off this is not a backpackers tent by any means it is a beast ive divided mine into three bags including one rolling duffel bag which makes loading and unloading the tent more manageable but if you are car camping especially for longer periods just stop shopping and buy this tent it is built like a tank and is really about the perfect size for two people and all the gear you can muster i almost purchased the model without the awning and am very glad that i didnt do that the awning is delightful and really adds to your available space we recently had a rainy day it would downpour about every hour and a half i was able to drag a picnic table partially under the awning to make coffee and cook on we had a pleasant day just sitting under the awning watching the raindrops fall we didnt feel confined or rained in at all i was skeptical that theyve solved the problem of canvas wicking water when you touch it but they have i tried this over and over and i could not get any water to come through the canvas even in heavy downpours this tent just feels good and it makes us smile i can give no higher recommendation for a product thank you kodiak canvas best tent i have owned posted by martin s on rd jun  bought this tent to use on property i own in northern new hampshire set it up in may and left it up thru september every time i returned to my property the tent was just as i left it and everything inside was bone dry i dont know how many thunderstorms this tent went thru but it survived them all without a single leak or problem love this tent  worth every penny posted by unknown on th may  this is our th season using this tent and it shows very little wear we started when the kids were    weve stayed dry during storms and have plenty of space we now put two cots and one bunk bed cot inside and there is still room to move around often one parent usually mom puts up the tent on their own while the other is with the kidssetting up camp the screen enclosure gives us extra room for gear and the dog crate we tie x tarps to the awning poles to form walls during rain to extend our living space i cannot imagine going back to crawling into a popup tent im dry  others are not posted by staci l on th jan  this past summer i was able to stay in this tent during a family camping trip there is always at least one afternoon and evening during our annual event that is hampered by weather this year was no different i was able to sit or stand  im  and listen to the weather but not be exposed at all me and my gear stayed completely dry we had two oversize cots bags and clothing there was plenty of room plenty of windows to open for the cross breeze after the weather passed also good for letting in the sunshine the only thing that i dont like about this tent is the zipper angle on the door the zipper head doesnt take that corner very smoothly but its not enough of a dislike to lower my star rating well made product that i look forward to using for many years best tent ive owned posted by unknown on nd sep  big shout out to kodiak canvas had a few buddies buy the deluxe cabin tent and bring it on a hunting trip in jaunuary for az archery deer had some cold crappy weather and these tents performed flawlessly very roomy and can fit two cots with a ton of gear comfortably best

were very pleased with the overall feel and presence of the tent the directions were clear and easy to follow we soaked it down good with the hose to check for leaks and to shrink the fabric as recommended the water proofing shed the water off the tent like a fresh wax on a new car just spent  days in central michigan fishing with  college buddies we were very comfortable with plenty of room to cook under the awning and to stow gear we sat out one down pour that lasted about  minutes that left   of water in a  gallon bucket with all of us and our gear high and dry all and all this is going to be a great tent for truck camping buckeye first time setting it up in the backyard took about an hour with the help of my wife we were very pleased with the overall feel and presence of the

while on a camping trip in the mountains near santa fe nm we had  days of sustained winds over  mph with gusts over  mph with just a little drizzle i used the optional screen for the awning overall i was very happy with the tent and would recommend it because of the design of the tent poles it does take  adults to set the tent up in the wind it took  of us the tent is very well made and we love the big windows it would be nice to have a screen on the front door the side door would be better if it zipped from the top the instructions were lacking but if you have spent time camping and setting up tents this shouldnt be a problem the optional screen enclosure did not have any instructions but was simple to figure out it was great for keeping the blowing dirt and any bugs away it was also a lot cooler under the awning than just being in the shade what i did not like about the awning is that i couldnt stake any of the front section of it down because it did not reach the ground the front pools are not adjustable because of this the  front poles kept moving during the high winds unlike the tent stakes the stakes for the screen enclosure are smaller and did not work that well we did use the tie outs but it wasnt enough i noticed that there were strings hanging from some of the seams on the front of the enclosure it would also be nice if there were tie backs for the screen when it is not zipped up kak was a very fast and easy process to get this tent i love the tent because of the quality of it and for this price you cant beat it you cant go wrong with this tent quick and easy set up and it folds away pretty nice as well overall i am very impressed big fish this tent is substantial and by that i mean heavy with quality construction shipped fast let me say the box with tent and poles weighs in excess of  pounds but with that said you can appreciate the build quality  this tent is built to last and will stand up to long use in extreme conditions this is not your recreational nylon family style tent it is a portable camp that will stand the test to be sure customer wow cant say enough good things about kodak tents or competitive edge just finished a hunting trip to mt hood oregon  days of rain  wsnow and  mph wind gusts my  tent and enclosure took it all and i stayed warm and dry fantastic quality super prices i believe anything less would have sent me home on day  now ordering the ground cover to complete my package customer received the tent and set it up its pretty amazing the quality top notch my only issue  no door screen on awning side door the pole bag has a hole in it from shipping needs replacing anyone who goes camping often should own this tent everything about it is heavy duty made to last like the hanger loops inside the floor is super heavy duty vinyl  the tent pegs are the best ive seen i used to use large spike nails and still do with the other tents i own these meet those standards and then some the awning is a must the side doorwindow screen should zip down center and to the sides instead of from bottom up and out minor details but heeding the advice of the end user in your design could make the product even better i would pay for the up grades glenette my husband and i purchased this tent and the full wall enclosure that attaches to the deluxe awning canopy it was easy to set up and provided enough space to comfortably sit out a rainstorm in the additional wall enclosure the layout of the tent and all the additional wall hanging pockets helped us to organize our gear and and have plenty of space for sleeping and storage the only downfall about this tent is that it is very heavy but that is to be expected with canvas mark cant wait to use this tent set it up in the back yard took about  hour complete set up  enclosure part also hosed it down with water hose full blast did not leak anywhere bean we reviewed many tents before purchasing the kodiak the size is great but it leaked the first weekend we used it even though we seasoned it before venturing out both nights we had leaks from the ceiling but none from the windows it was heavy as review in other reviews but for some reason both times we set it up it took four adults and a teenager to set it up i could see the minimum it could take would be three adults we were truly hoping for something for two adults would i buy this again no camping should not be this much work hunts  food take the advice in the instructions booklet set the tent up prior to using it i seasoned the tent by lightly spraying water on it as instructed and noticed it leaked in three different places and along the seam in the back of the tent i used kiwi camp dry silicone based and hopefully that will fix the leaks the rubber tips on the tent poles that insert into the grommets have a tendency to slip upward and sideways i used super glue on these parts and hopefully they will stay in place the room enclosure is a light green in color not tan or white as expected spoke to mike in customer service who told me some of the enclosures are coming out of the manufacturer with that color majorusmc well worth the money my wife nearly had a heart attack when i said i wanted to spend  on a tent however she knows that i only buy the best this purchase only reinforces that we purchased the x tent with awning and the optional side walls very impressed with the quality of the tent poles pegs and accessories truly a quality product that will last a lifetime the only suspect item is the rubber attach points for the ends of the poles insert into the tent grommets i noticed that if i wasnt careful that they would begin to pull out of the tent pole setup of the tent was straight forward setup of the awning and optional side walls was far from clear i did a practice run in the backyard before we went camping highly recommend that you do the same tent was spacious had great head room heavyduty floor and with the added enclosed awning provides first class accommodations no regrets transaction was smooth and shipping was fast very pleased updated on  unclebefbef finally got to put up our new kodiak tent it was as good as i had hoped materials and workmanship looks great i have had a cheaper made canvas tent for  plus years and this one is far better should be able to put up in about  minutes next time with my wife did a lot of shopping and could not beat competitive products price and free shipping was great too shipping took about  week but christmas day fell right in the middle of that so i wont complain at all  thanks for the great product and service  will be ordering screen room as soon as they are available and the ground cloth works just great the hiker purchased the  in summer of  with the screen enclosure we have camped in the adirondacks and acadia national park with this tent very comfortable and breathable this tent is excellent it does take  people to set up but with a little practice you can easily be set up in  minutes we use it for two people with air mattresses and tables the hanging storage caddys are excellent for your loose items this year we got the wall enclosure option wow we have  x  and  x   two room tent this is an excellent option for when it rains you can change out of wet clothing etc without bringing them or your muddy boots in to the sleeping area this is a great looking tent and we get many compliments all purchased from competitive edge who are very good distributors bsingletary great tent love it good for a family trip plenty of room mbarry we purchased this tent with the deluxe screen room it took us a while to set up but we are sure it will take much less time the more we use it our previous nylon tent was larger however this tent feels much more spacious my husband is  and he can walk around standing up we love it and cannot wait to go on our first camping trip to use it frickinducky my husband and i spent months searching for the perfect tent for a year plus long boon docking trip across the country so glad we decided on this one we have lived in it now for two weeks and the only leak issue we had was our fault did not have the poles tight enough and water pooled this is a burly solid home i have a chronic pain condition and arthritis but have little problem setting this up with hubby my only concern is that there is already light rust at some weld spots and the support nubs on the side poles however we can take care of that love all the windows but be aware that the screening is a light material we have had rains since the first and it has performed to perfection love sitting under the awning watching the storms luke ok here goes   first off i would fire the guy that writes directions for kodiak second if you buy this tent go out and buy another  feet of  inch rope and some big tent stakes on our second attempt to keep this tent up in the flat land winds we have here with no luck its a little more than frustrating to say the least i wouldnt recommend this tent without the add on enclosure i say that even though thats the hardest thing to keep erect on this tent just gives you twice the room for another  bucks or whatever it is checklist for things you need hammer pliers or channel locks step stool unless you are  like me my brother wasnt able to reach the tops where a lot of things come together i would recommend having a permanent marker handy to mark the poles once its up we did have a pretty big thunder storm last night and we all stayed dry in the tent oh yeah to anyone that says they put this thing up by themselves or with an  year old the first time is full of crap this is a two person setup im worried how my wife is gonna be able to help me and keep out  month old from getting in the way i think there are a lot of false posts online from kodiak people saying this thing is easy to set up cause its not next to impossible in the wind too my tent is half knocked over right now i will repost maybe with better reviews once i try the extra rope i bought and stakes thanks roadking first trip out with our new tent was an awesome experience the tent was easy to setup it weathered an unexpected severe thunderstorm with  mpg gusts with flying colors a little water did get in the awning with wall enclosure and near the side door but was dried easily with a towel our tent was the talk of the campground dirty foot this is one great tent i have been looking for a tent that would be comfortable and more accommodating on long trips this is my first canvas tent and i can say that this is far better than my old dome nylon tent for starters it kept me very dry during a heavy downpour on my first trip with it no leaks at all after hours of heavy rain with four people sleeping in it heavy rain and all the windows up but one it was still very comfortable some think canvas would be hot not so this thing breathes well this is a heavy tent and takes a little more to put it up so plan to give yourself a little time when you first get to your campsite the canopy is tricky and really needs two people to put up the rest is doable by yourself but i would prefer to have another person the canopy was great with the wall enclosure to keep the bugs out which were really bad this spring if you put some comfortable cots in this you will have one nice set up once you put this up two or three times it gets a lot easier i would recommend getting some quality stakes like the ones from snow peak either the  or  inch the stakes included are not ideal in my opinion also im going to buy a quality canvas ground cloth even though the floor material is very thick i want this to be my last tent i have to purchase and i think it will be this is a high quality tent that i know i will have for many years very glad i bought it even after its dry i spread it out in the house with the ac on  ceiling fan on low to make sure all the moisture is out of the fabric probably going overboard doing so but want to keep any mold from having a chance to get to it canadiannorth this item far exceeded my expectations on quality it is fairly simple to setup and take down for a tent of this caliber here are the pros and cons pros excellent quality and durability lots of windows and space with the attached awning easy setup and takedown excellent in windy conditions perfect for a family setting or people with animals cons heavy but more durable wall enclosure is not canvass material is like other synthetic tents twoperson setup definitely needed for the awning part to eliminate setup time tent and awning poles should be in separate bags if you are looking for a heavy durable tent then you need look no further i have been to a lot of outdoor store outlets and online competitive edge has the cheapest price around for this tent or the attachment of the wall enclosure cheers canadian north tbates i would have given this tent  stars if there were better directions the tent is amazing fabulous quality i can tell we will be using this for years there was  book in the box it had very little directions could use better directions i know setting up a tent is pretty simple we got the screen section and no directions for it chris this is a very nice tent seems very strong we will utilize in new brunswick this year be careful though its a bit heavy for a shortterm use but not really for a week or more cep customer i bought the tent for the quality and thats what i received very pleased with tent easy to setup and very durable and the best price any were camping just become comfortable thanks karnevil the tent arrived within a week along with the extra wall kit for the awning after reading the instructions i set the tent up to season it with water not realizing that the weather would turn to storms two days early i didn’t have time to let the tent dry and pack it up before it started raining on its first use the tent survived  inches of rain and  to  mph winds with no problems i checked the guy lines but didn’t have to tighten any of them after the storm even the awning room stayed dry only one small puddle less than a solo cup of water formed on the up wind side but was my fault for not completely sealing the velcro to the bottom over all this is a great tent and well made it is designed for multiple setup options allowing it to accommodate almost any camp site not mentioned in the description is a power port on the front left side allowing easy access for hoses or electrical cords inside the tent it is heavy and really needs two bags for the polls one for the canopy polls and one for the tent polls but other than that it is a great tent and i expect it to last years update  we took the tent on a  day lake outing the st day started out nice but after the sun went down the weather turned nasty it rained heavy for almost  hours the winds were estimated at  miles an hour or more the storm caused one of the poles to slide down on our kodiak tent letting the side flap inward i went out to fully extend the pole again and add another stake to that side i realized that several other campers were not fairing as well since their dome tents were flattened by the wind the next day i found out that  tents were damaged beyond repair and several others had blown over during the storm with a few even getting the contents of their tents soaked our kodiak tent held up to the storm keeping us dry and comfortable and all our gear protected updated on  customer this was the best price i found online for this tent with free shipping luan this tent comes in two heavy bags which make it easier to carry we went camping at assateague and it was cold and windy with light rain it was solid and comfortable setting it up requires two people and a small step ladder to set uptake down the tall awningcanopy you probably will need a pair of pliers to unstuck some slidingtelescoping poles we set up  small cots and  large cots not much room is left for walking around with  cots but lots of storage room underneath the cots the tent could use lop or something on the ceiling to hang a lantern it came with six cords but could use at least a few more for more solid staking momto hi so first things first while i am writing my review is to state we bought this in the off camping season here in wisconsin for the springfall camping trips we bought this tent with the wall enclosures for the awning shipping was super fast and because we had looked at another canvas tent company we knew it was over  to just ship this thing so thats great they offer free shipping i will say these boxes are heavy they are not light at all they also are a weird size so tend to be kind of funky to get a hand on them my husband was able to get them in they house after a bit of a struggle we decided to ditch the boxes the tent and walls came in because they were wet with snow now the tent itself isnt that heavy but your poles   thats where the weight is we transferred the tent to the bag that came with the poles will not fit in that bag once the tent is unrolled and rerolled there is enough room in the bag after the tent is in there for the stakes and ground tarp we did partially set it up in our home we wanted to get the material off the floor that is taped in there so we did not have to pull it out later i will be posting an update but since we have snow and ice here right now and freezing temps and wind chill we will wait till april to get this outside updated on  david used it september  in colorado mts great tent with side awning stood up to heavy rainssleet and wind easy to put up and does take two persons to set up but one takes longer i will buy another one later thanks great service and help from personnel at competitive edge macgyver the tent is very nice it took my  year old boy and i  minutes to put it up the first time bet i can do it in  minutes next time it will take  to put it up but do not need a tent this big for just  any way love the front awning it will help keep the tent clean tip  get the enclosure with it makes a good storage and eating place aaero yes it is a nice heavy tent but first off it comes in a nylon bag for the canvas tent and a cheep sack for the poles i have had the tent out  times and already need service the poles will not stay erect due to a poor design stitching seams are coming apart already as well trush this tent is incredible by far the best tent i have ever owned and i have had several this is a great improvement over the canvas tents of yesteryear that i camped in as a kid i opted for the wall enclosure and have found it to be a great addition i also went to home depot and purchased some turf carpet to put on the floor of the awning it made it like an additional tent my wife and i used it as our kitchendining room but it could easily accommodate at least  more people should you require the space occasionally i would recommend setting it up in the back yard first to familiarize yourself with it while it says it requires two people to set it up i set it up by myself twice the first time it took a little over an hour but the second time only a little over a half hour including the awning and wall enclosure take down takes only about  min and the bag they give you for the tent is plenty big enough to easily accommodate the tent so you do not have to fold it an exact way to get it to fit service was great shipping was fast and best of all free to see this tent check out my youtube video here httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvpmlgmpwwi updated on  bb we do a lot of camping and have owned many tents this one is by far the best one yet quality and workmanship appear to be first class the size was an important consideration for us as we will be camping for a month or so at a time we like the additional space of the awning and purchased the enclosure for it as well i was reluctant to purchase because of the weight  lbs we were concerned about how we would be able to carry  lbs back and forth to set up as it turned out the tent canvas is separate from the poles each has their own carrying bagshould market that fact id guess the weight would be about  some lbs for the canvas and  some for the poles one recommendation wed have is to put the poles in two bags  one for the awning poles and one for the tent poles we separated ours that way after purchase and it is a more manageable weight the set up is pretty straight forward one person could set up and take down except at a couple points you need someone to help raise or lower pole supports overall a great tent customer love my kodiak tent customer great purchase experience good price free shipping no hassle process al customer thank you for rushing that tent out on time for me it is so refreshing the customer service like yours still exists its a wonderful tent and made for a wonderful weekend and it all happened because you were willing to make it happen thank you thank you thank you dude this tent was totally awesome all materials were solid and of good workmanship during our trip we experienced two days of torrential rain i was pleasantly surprised that not a single drop of water came into the tent one morning we woke up and there must have been  gallons of water pooled on the roof but it had not even begun to seep through my wife and i set it up in an hour but would have no problem setting it up in  minutes by myself next time one thing that i would prefer to see is a floor in the screen room other than that it was great cep customer great tent more head room then you would think i am  and have no problems just a great tent in general geo received it just in time for an early may  trip to a lake weather was cool rained two days and really hard overnight but i was dry as expected not a leak anywhere had big winds for two days but a few extra tie downs really stabilized the tent very well the canopy was great to have and i cant wait to try the wall enclosure just arrived and screen enclosure bo it is heavy especially the poles but its very sturdy and i expect to get decades of use from it one person setup is challenging try it at home first to say the least but it is possible with two we set up the entire camp in one hour with the tent taking about  minutes very pleased highly recommended josephrs great tent and we plan on really testing it out this summer we are camping all summer in the green mountain national forest i have owned north face and eureka four season tents and have been through  weeks of solid rain in alaska did well for about  days i believe this tent would make it all the way solid shelter well built misterferne this tent is awesome we received it within  days of ordering and with free shipping we opted for the screen enclosuregreat idea my wife and i bought this tent with another couple as a common area for rainy and snowy camping trips we set it up in the back yard and wet it down as suggested it only took  hr  min for  adults to set it up the first time i think we can do it in  min we have a trip planned in june to take it on its maiden voyage to steins mountain so excited craig i bought this about  weeks ago  w enclosed awning i got it with in a week i just set it up in our back yard with my  year old daughter it took us about  hours this was our first time setting up the tent and we were in no hurry it rained today which i knew it would we are seasoning the tent as directed to do it will be dry and sunny tomorrow and we will that it down i can see this will probable be the last tent i have to buy an experienced camper could set this tent up alone in about  hr or less i am very pleased with the tent and service i received i would recommend this tent to any serious campers as long as you do not have to walk far with it it is very heavy thank you for a great product don i have had the so called top of the line nylon tents in the past and had quite a few camping trips ruined because of leaks when it rained i havent actually camped in this tent yet but did set it up in the yard for a week and it rained on it for  days i was pleasingly surprised when i opened the door and everything was as dry as when i set it up i also purchased the screen enclosure for some extra dry space very nice i would recommend this to anyone that wants to stay dry and comfortable while camping delivery was quicker than i expected also me we spent a lot of time looking for a canvas tent this is it we took it to the mountains of north carolina during thanksgiving cold outside warmer on the inside the x vestibule was nice but i would suggest a small modification to extend the vertical lines of the optional enclosure along the tent edge in lieu of straight down we used a tarp to configure this and it gave us just a few inches extra that were not available with the enclosure this added more storage under our table and a bit more room for cooking the head room made it appear bigger than our  x  tent we had to replace excellent choice if you want a sturdy well constructed base tent rdmcj i have not spent much time tent camping but after the bug bit i knew it was time to get a serious tent the kodak is a serious tent we have only used it once so far and the weather was very accommodating but the feel and design of the tent is good quality it is a bit heavy for anything but car camping which suits us fine we are expecting to get many years of use from this tent this weekend will be our nd outing if you are in the need for a strong sturdy canvas tent look no further than the kodak steve just spent  nights in high desert south east of tucson loved the tents large size and the awning scoutsdad what a wonderful product tested the first weekend in strong winds rain and cold excellent had small heater and stayed very warm the enclosed awning is an excellent addition for cooking service was great and quick not a backpackers tent but is a phenomenal base camp tent headed out west the winter to shake it down again gman we have used this tent couple of times now and i am completely satisfied the whole setup from the floor to the canvas to the poles is made with high quality materials i am confident that with the proper care this tent will last me a lifetime i also would like to comment on the service of competitive edge this was my first purchase with them so naturally i was a little leery my worries were completely unfounded everything came through as they said it would i will definitely be back skg this is a great tent  it is well made and relatively easy to put up although it does take two people i wish it came in a larger size but we purchased both the screen and enclosure to give us more room easy no hassle shipping utahcamper we bought one of these earlier this year we have used it many times in the rain and once in the snow even i was very impressed when i opened the box and saw how thick the canvas really is the floor is nice and the deluxe awning has been a lifesaver in the rain i definitely recommend this item write a review name email address rating  select score  ★ ★★ ★★★ ★★★★ ★★★★★ your query complete submit review related products teton
