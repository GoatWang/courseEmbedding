the new york timesthe united states became the worlds largest economy because we invented products and then made them with new processes with design and fabrication side by side insights from the factory floor flowed back to the drawing board today our most important task is to restart this virtuous cycle of invention and manufacturing rebuilding our manufacturing capacity requires the demolition of the idea that the united states can thrive on its service sector alone we need to create at least  million jobs in the next decade to offset the effects of the recession and to address our  billion trade deficit in manufactured goods these problems are related given that the service sector accounts for only  percent of world trade to make our economy grow sell more goods to the world and replenish the work force we need to restore manufacturing – not the assemblyline jobs of the past but the hightech advanced manufacturing of the future advanced manufacturing relies on the marriage of science and engineering in cuttingedge fields cepheid a company in sunnyvale calif with a market capitalization of more than  billion designs and manufactures sophisticated instruments that use dna analysis to detect infectious disease and cancer its products are used by hospitals for diagnoses and by the postal service to screen mail for anthrax a young company called lilliputian systems has developed handheld chargers for mobile devices the chargers use a recyclable highenergy butane cartridge to replenish cellphones and laptops more efficiently than wall chargers the company has a pilot manufacturing plant in wilmington mass plans to expand its production capacity and uses an intel component that is also made in massachusetts a decade ago with help from an energy department grant yetming chiang an mit professor made a nanotechnology breakthrough by manipulating lithium battery electrodes he helped start a company a systems that now makes millions of batteries each year for hybridelectric cars and buses and largescale energy storage systems the company recently hired its th employee about half the workers at its plant in suburban detroit were unemployed before a systems came to town like the jet aircraft made by boeing one of the countrys largest exporters products like these require sophisticated manufacturing equipment operated by skilled workers and benefit from the tight integration of design and production with goods like these the united states can reassert an economic advantage if we can find ways for companies of every size to exploit the possibilities of nanofabrication advanced materials robotics and energy efficiency we can create networks of innovation joining lab research to new production processes and business models the united states remains a top producer of advanced technology products but our dominance has eroded ten years ago we enjoyed a trade surplus in advanced technology manufactured goods today that category accounts for an  billion annual trade deficit countries that used to make inexpensive goods at low cost have developed the capacity to produce highvalue goods making it ever more tempting for american companies to design at home but manufacture abroad this not only destroys manufacturing jobs but also saps our inventive advantage manufacturers conduct  percent of privatesector research and development and employ  percent of the nations scientists and engineers but factories abroad attract design and engineering talent over time manufacturing off shore leads to innovation off shore to make matters worse as the presidents council of advisers on science and technology recently reported other nations are investing heavily in manufacturing while our investments lag president obama asked me and andrew n liveris the chief executive of dow chemical to lead the advanced manufacturing partnership a group of industry academic and government representatives that will find ways to speed up research in advanced materials and processes and increase our pool of skilled labor the private sector cannot do this alone since world war ii federal investments in scientific research have set off waves of jobcreating innovation in aviation electronics computing the internet and biotechnology we need major innovation investment if we are to achieve similar breakthroughs today but the recent debtceiling compromise could compel some  percent in cuts to federal research and development money in  that could lead to a decade of stagnation we must recommit to innovation if we want to reenergize our economy a new era of advanced manufacturing also requires more graduates with greater proficiency in science technology engineering and mathematics the national association of manufacturers together with community colleges recently announced a program to certify a halfmillion skilled workers in five years and to connect them with manufacturing jobs we need more initiatives like this the prospect of good manufacturing jobs in the united states is not a fantasy germany and japan enjoy high wages and run major surpluses in manufactured goods so can we our economy will thrive only when we make what we invent   speeches letters to mit community opeds  essays massachusetts institute of technology  massachusetts avenue cambridge ma   susan j hockfield phd executive

economic forum meeting in davos switzerland addresses threats to geopolitical stability and human life and seeks ways to accelerate the design of more effective political economic and technological tools to address them among this generation’s most daunting challenges are food water and energy shortages climate change and rising sea levels and the spread of new drugresistant diseases humanity has faced threats to its existence and the health of the planet before yet we have managed to avoid the apocalypse or at least postpone it through ingenuity and invention this year’s davos meeting will offer a glimpse of where the next life planet and economysaving discoveries and products will come from and where we should invest our talents and treasure to fuel the next generation of transformative technologies an accelerating convergence of the biological physical and engineering sciences promises a stunning array of new technological solutions imagine a coalfueled power plant that emits only water and clean air inside the plant designer yeast cells transform the carbon dioxide released during the coal’s combustion into raw materials for floor tiles and other construction suppliesor imagine a simple and inexpensive urine test that can diagnose cancer eliminating the need for a surgical biopsy and when cancer treatment is needed its toxic punch hits cancer cells selectively with far fewer damaging side effectsor imagine a future with plentiful food and fuel crops through improved seed stocks and more efficient water management we can have crops that require less water grow at higher density and thrive in wider temperature ranges and datadriven agriculture supply chains will move them more effectively to the market these advances will enable us to feed and provide power – at a lower economic and environmental cost – to the anticipated  population of nine billion peoplethese and other innovations are emerging from the convergence of biology and engineering that is now upon us a new generation of scientists engineers and clinicians educated more broadly than their predecessors speak the languages of both and are working together in unprecedented ways they are conversing across disciplines – not only engineering and biology but also chemistry physics mathematics and computation – and setting new paths for innovation from initial discovery to the launch of advanced applications in the marketplacethe technologies on which many of us depend today arose from a parallel convergence of discoveries in physics and engineering in the early twentieth century in  the world did not have ready access to electricity automobiles and aviation or telecommunications in much of the world we now take these conveniences for granted indeed we regard them as necessitieswhat began as esoteric explorations of the workings of the physical world – the nature of electromagnetism and the atomic structure of matter for example – became in the hands of inventors and innovators telecommunications new drugs medical imaging and devices nuclear power the computer chip and the internet there are now more connected mobile devices than there are people on the planetthe products of electronic and digital industries will continue to expand their impact with “big data” the “internet of things” and the “industrial internet” becoming increasingly prevalent beyond the extension of these twentiethcentury technologies we can also anticipate a new set of transformational industries – as yet nameless – as we advance into the new millenniumat the same time just as the twentieth century’s convergence of physics and engineering transformed our lives the accelerating convergence of biology and engineering is driving unprecedented discoveries that promise to create another platform for innovation the rise of new industries and economic growth the manufacture of fuels and pharmaceuticals already relies on purposedeveloped microbes that create sophisticated biological products new manufacturing processes will incorporate specially designed microbes and computercharacterized compounds into an array of products donate now likewise the dramatic reduction in the cost of gene sequencing from roughly  million per human genome in  to about  today together with a rapid increase in computational power is boosting the speed accuracy and robustness of medical diagnostic tests that promises not only more timely and effective therapies for cancer but also similar advances against other currently intractable diseasesthe industries and economic drivers of the twentyfirst century will arise from the increasingly combined efforts of biology and engineering it is this convergence that will help deliver the technological solutions
