profile       the leder group is the product of forty years of successful real estate investing orchestrated by dr samuel e leder dr leder began his career as a veterinarian in  by  academy animal hospital located on federal highway in fort lauderdale opened its doors as his first small animal practice december  marked the sale of the last of dr leders eleven veterinary practices while his veterinary license is still active he no longer practices shortly after the inception of dr leders first veterinary practice he began investing in commercial real estate his approach at the time had more to do with creating alternate sources of cash flow to supplement what he could produce from his veterinary practice than with trying to create a real estate organization in august  dr leders oldest son sean leder returned to florida from new york city to work with his father on the familys real estate interests previously sean spent two years working on wall street the last of which was spent underwriting equity and debt financings for real estate investment trusts with merrill lynch in their real estate investment banking division during that time sean had the opportunity to work with some of the most professionally managed and wellfinanced real estate organizations in the country sean leder as chief executive officer of the leder group is responsible for the daytoday management of the familys and their partners holdings additionally he is responsible for evaluating all new acquisition development and management opportunities the leder group philosophy on investing in real estate is based on the aggressive and proactive acquisition and management of assets that are approached from a buy and hold perspective we are very selective based on the fact that we are averse to selling assets once they have been acquired dr leders forty years of investing experience coupled with the youthful energy of his son empowers the leder group to maximize opportunities in the acquisition development and management of investment properties       samuel m elder  chicago il  intelius sign in we found samuel m elder in chicago il samuel m elder intelius found that samuel m
