karvelis pelican has submitted the report and deposition testimony of dr albert karvelis the report and testimony include technicalexpert opinions on the infringement and validity of the  patent dr karvelis is a professional engineer licensed in many states he holds a phd in engineering acoustics and has forty years experience in machinery and manufacturing—in particular in mechanical power transmission machine design vibration and acoustics failure analysis and machinery and fluid dynamics and fluid machinery docket entry no  ex b in sum his training experience and expertise are in mechanical engineering at his deposition dr karvelis testified about his experience in the asphalt industry dr karvelis has no experience working with a binder formulator formulating asphalt mixtures designing asphaltmanufacturing facilities or working in a laboratory environment that produces samples of asphalt mixtures docket entry no  ex c at  instead his experience in the asphalt industry is limited to the well over  hours he has worked on client projects in connection with coldmilling machinery see id at   dr karvelis explained however that he believes he has enormous amount of experience in asphalt cement and its behavior as a fluid    because all fluids follow the same laws of physics id at  he also testified that he gained an understanding of the making of rubberized asphalt through substantial research including reading an asphalt handbook id dr karvelis clearly has expert knowledge in fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics he just as clearly lacks expertise in asphalt formulation as a binder formulator or otherwise wright argues that because dr karvelis lacks any training knowledge or experience as a binder formulator he lacks ordinary skill in the art and thus is unqualified to provide technicalexpert testimony under rule  docket entry no  at  pelican responds that this court made no formal findings about the education and experience necessary for one to possess the ordinary skill in the art required to testify as a technical expert about infringement and validity of the claims at issue pelican additionally contends that even had the court made such findings they could be revised in light of the new evidence docket entry no  at  pelican argues that a person possessing ordinary skill in the art relevant to the  patent would have different expertise and knowledge than one possessing ordinary skill in the art relevant to the  patent on which dr karvelis will provide technicalexpert testimony according to pelican the relevant art is defined by the nature of the problem confronting the wouldbe inventor id at  emphasis in original the nature of the problem posed by the  patent pelican asserts is one involving fluid dynamics and mechanical equipment id at  emphasis omitted therefore according to pelican a person possessing ordinary skill in the art for the  patent is one who possesses expertise on fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics which dr karvelis clearly does pelican relies on ryko manufacturing co v nustar inc  fd   fed cir  for the proposition that the problem facing the inventor dictates what skill in the art is required see id at  wright replies that the parties agree that one of ordinary skill in the art has asphalt formulation experience which dr karvelis admittedly lacks docket entry no  at  according to wright the case law does not support the proposition that one of ordinary skill in the art could be someone with experience limited to a subfield id at  in other words although understanding parts of the  patent may require knowledge of fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics to understand and offer expert testimony the patent claims requires knowledge of asphalt formulation pelican is correct that this court previously did not expressly make formal findings as to what ordinary skill in the art requires until pelican filed its current motions the record did not present the need for such a finding as the federal circuit has explained while it is always preferable for the factfinder below to specify the level of skill it has found to apply to the invention at issue the absence of specific findings on the level of skill in the art does not give rise to reversible error where the prior art itself reflects an appropriate level and a need for testimony is not shown okajima v bourdeau  fd   fed cir  internal quotation marks omitted given pelicans motions formal findings making explicit what is required to have ordinary skill in the relevant art are now necessary although this court did not make formal findings in its markman opinion the court noted that the experts agreed that the person having ordinary skill in the art is a binder formulator not a binder technician docket entry no  at  the court resolved the experts insignificant disagreement over the precise level of education required by noting that the experts agreed that approximately a decade of experience working in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator would be necessary to become a binder formulator and that this knowledge and experience was more important than a particular degree or credential id at  this courts markman opinion therefore proceeded under the implicit finding supported by the parties agreements that one possessing ordinary skill in the art is a binder formulator or one who has worked for approximately a decade in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator this implicit finding applied to both of the disputed patents pelican correctly points out that district courts may engage in a rolling claim construction in which the court revisits and alters its interpretation of the claim terms as its understanding of the technology evolves pressure prods med supplies inc v greatbatch ltd  fd   fed cir  internal quotation marks omitted this iterative approach encompasses findings—implicit or formal—of what it means to possess ordinary skill in the art the question the motion presents is whether based on the expanded record arguments and authorities this court should revise its previous implicit finding that for the  patent one possessing ordinary skill in the art is one who has expertise in fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics but not in asphalt formulation both parties experts previously agreed that one possessing ordinary skill in the art for both patents is either a binder formulator or one who has worked for approximately a decade in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator this was and is consistent with the fact that both patents are directed at specialized processes for manufacturing asphalt products framing the issue in the terms pelican now uses the nature of the problem posed by both patents—not just the  patent as pelican urges—is asphalt formulation specifically the nature of the problem is neither fluid dynamics specifically nor fluid mechanics generally pelicans argument does not support a finding that expertise in fluid dynamics or fluid mechanics is a sufficient basis for technicalexpert testimony on infringement or invalidity of the  patent dr karvelis lacks skill in the relevant art for both the  and  patents asphalt formulation that conclusion is supported by his testimony about working well over  hours on asphaltrelated projects for clients assuming a hour work week dr karvelis has worked approximately  weeks in asphalt formulation over his entire professional career that conclusion is also supported by his testimony about reading a textbook about asphalt if  weeks of experience and reading a textbook was all that was required to be skilled in the relevant art and qualified under rule  the bar would be lower than the rule and case law demands dr karveliss undisputed skill is in the more general field of fluid dynamics and fluid mechanics that does not render him qualified under the applicable legal standards to provide technicalexpert testimony on two patents directed at asphalt formulation at a hearing pelicans counsel argued that dr karvelis is sufficiently skilled to testify with respect to the circulation    step of the  patent docket entry no  at  under this limited approach dr karvelis would testify only to the circulation aspects of claims  and  of the  patent wright responds that dr karvelis cannot simply testify about what the disputed term jet spray nozzles means in those claims because construing that term in the claims must be done in the context of asphalt formulation id at  put another way dr karvelis lacks relevant skill in the art of both the field and the invention of asphalt formulation the case law supports wrights argument the person of ordinary skill in the art is deemed to read the claim term not only in the context of the particular claim in which the disputed term appears but in the context of the entire patent including the specification phillips v awh corp  fd   fed cir  en banc see also adams respiratory therapeutics inc v perrigo co  fd   fed cir  the context of both the  and  patents is a process directed to asphalt formulation that is the relevant art and it is one in which dr karvelis lacks ordinary skill in the art to allow dr karveliss proposed testimony construing jet spray nozzles or the circulation steps in claims  and  would permit claim construction in a vacuum which the federal circuit makes clear is impermissible finally pelican contends that this court may allow dr karvelis to testify because the parties dispute what the ordinary skill in the relevant art consists of and whether dr karvelis possesses it creating a fact question for the jury see docket entry no  at  there are two problems with pelicans argument first although there may be a dispute as to the extent of knowledge about binder formulation required the record does not give rise to disputed facts material to deciding that experience and expertise in asphalt formulation are required to be a person of ordinary skill in the art relevant to the  and  patents the parties experts agreed that one possessing ordinary skill in the art is a binder formulator or one who has worked for approximately a decade in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator the federal circuit has held while the ultimate conclusion of obviousness is for the court to decide as a matter of law several factual inquiries underlie this determination see graham v john deere co  us    these inquiries involve the scope and content of the prior art the level of ordinary skill in the field and of the invention the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art and any objective evidence of nonobviousness such as longfelt need and commercial success see id sibia neurosciences inc v cadus pharm corp  fd   fed cir  emphasis added although a factfinder could conclude that less than a decades worth of experience is sufficient to be skilled in the art no reasonable jury could conclude that someone with dr karveliss experience and expertise—highly trained in fluid dynamics and fluid mechanics generally but only slight tangential experience with asphalt formulation—is sufficiently skilled in the relevant art to adopt the approach pelican advocates would be inconsistent with the courts role as gatekeeper under rule  and the applicable case law see kumho  us at  daubert  us at  in sum this court adheres to and makes explicit its previous ruling that a person possessing ordinary skill in the relevant art is a binder formulator or one who has worked for approximately a decade in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator dr karvelis does not meet this criteria he is unqualified under the applicable legal standards to provide technicalexpert testimony on the  patent as proposed by pelican wrights motion to exclude his expert testimony is granted c eric steffe pelican has submitted expert testimony of eric steffe on patent office practice and alleged irregularities in that

the law firm of sterne kessler goldstein and fox pllc from  to  as a student associate from  to  as an associate and from  to the present as a director docket entry no  ex d at  wright argues that steffe should not be allowed to testify for two reasons first steffe is not skilled in the art and has no basis for explaining how one skilled in the art would view the  patent docket entry no  at

defense these opinions are distinguishable from and inconsistent with the majority of cases including binding precedent from the federal circuit a good example of such binding precedent is the federal circuits  decision in sundance the defendant attempted to introduce a patent attorneys technicalexpert testimony under rule  about uspto practices and procedures eight pages explaining prosecution and reexamination claim construction four pages interpreting the claim construction ruling noninfringement seven pages concluding that the claims of the  patent are not infringed invalidity including anticipation and obviousness thirteen pages concluding that the claims of the  patent are invalid and inequitable conduct six pages concluding that the  patent is unenforceable due to inequitable conduct  fd at  the plaintiff moved to exclude the attorney from testifying at trial arguing that he lacked ordinary skill in the art and could not provide expert testimony on invalidity or infringement the defendant responded that the attorney was qualified due to his experience as a patent attorney and because courts allow patent attorneys to testify about general procedures before the patent office id the district court denied the motion allowing the attorney to testify about all the subjects addressed in his report the federal circuit reversed it emphasized that to provide expert testimony on the issues of noninfringement and invalidity the proposed expert must be skilled in the relevant art not just in patent office procedures it is an abuse of discretion to permit a witness to testify as an expert on the issues of noninfringement or invalidity unless that witness is qualified as an expert in the pertinent art testimony proffered by a witness lacking the relevant technical expertise fails the standard of admissibility under fed r evid  indeed where an issue calls for consideration of evidence from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art it is contradictory to rule  to allow a witness to testify on the issue who is not qualified as a technical expert in the art we understand that patent lawyers are often qualified to testify as technical experts but such a qualification must derive from a lawyers technical qualifications in the pertinent art id at  the court emphasized that patent attorneys or former patent examiners were not only prohibited from providing expert testimony on the issues of noninfringement or invalidity but also from testifying about any of the underlying technical questions such as the nature of the claimed invention the scope and content of prior art the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art or the motivation of one of ordinary skill in the art to combine these references to achieve the claimed invention id at  in sundance the patent attorney wholly lacked the experience necessary to possess the relevant expertise in the pertinent art id at  being an experienced patent lawyer was insufficient because admitting testimony from such a person with no skill in the pertinent art serves only to cause mischief and confuse the factfinder unless a patent lawyer is also a qualified technical expert his testimony on these kinds of technical issues is improper and thus inadmissible id the case law makes it clear that a former patent examiner such as steffe may testify about general patent office practices and procedures but may not opine about how those practices and procedures may lead to erroneous approvals of patents in general or as applied to the patents at issue steffe cannot speculate about possible errors in the approval of the patent at issue in the case steffe cannot testify about noninfringement and invalidity because he lacks ordinary skill in the relevant art as in the sundance case five pages of steffes expert report are devoted to patent office practices and procedures see docket entry no  ex d at  nine pages to the  patents invalidity with respect to anticipation see id at  and four pages to the  patents invalidity with respect to enablement see id at  with respect to the five pages on practices and procedures to the extent that pelican wishes to present steffes testimony about patent office practices and procedures generally it may do so but part of this section discusses intrinsic pressure on patent office examiners that creates a higher risk of erroneous dispositions of patent applications such testimony is inadmissible the remainder of steffes expert report focuses on his opinion that the  patent is invalid steffe lacks ordinary skill in the relevant art he cannot testify about invalidity including about anticipation and enablement admitting testimony from a person such as mr steffe with no skill in the pertinent art serves only to cause mischief and confuse the factfinder  fd at  in a footnote pelican attempts to distinguish its case from all the others that exclude the former patent examiners testimony regarding infringement because he was not skilled in the art however this is to be contrasted with the facts regarding mr steffes opinions regarding invalidity as mr steffe relies on the testimony and opinions of persons who are skilled in the art docket entry no  at  n that is a distinction without a difference a witness is not qualified to provide technicalexpert testimony merely by studying declarations of those who do possess ordinary skill in the relevant art the technical expert must have the skill steffe does not the motion to exclude steffe as a technical expert is granted in part and denied in part as discussed in detail above steffe may testify about patent office practices and procedures generally his expert testimony is otherwise inadmissible d dr gayle king wright submitted a report and

the total available volume of the vessel is on the other side of the line and bottom portion as the area surrounding the lower interior face of the reactor vessel id at  pelican argued that these narrower definitions were necessary to avoid invalidity for indefiniteness id this court disagreed concluding that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence show that the terms are relative terms denoting the relationship of one portion to another not an absolute position within the reactor vessel id at  in particular the court noted the expert testimony of dr king who is skilled in the relevant art

reconsideration pelican again seeks a narrower construction middle portion as the middle third of the mixture in the reactor vessel and bottom portion as the lower third of the mixture in the reactor vessel docket entry no  at  in support of reconsideration pelican makes two arguments first a narrower construction is appropriate based on the testimony of dr karvelis who pelican has asserted is skilled in the relevant art second since the markman hearing evidence has emerged with respect to the location of supposed spray patterns in pelicans reactor vessel as well as the location of the opening of the return circulation conduit into the reactor vessel supporting narrower definitions of middle portion and bottom portion id at  the first argument does not weigh in favor of revising the claim construction although the earlier opinion did not include express findings about ordinary skill in the relevant art those findings were implicit in this opinion this court has made those findings explicit one possessing ordinary skill in the relevant art is a binder formulator or one who has worked for approximately a decade in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator in doing so this court rejected pelicans argument that the ordinary skill in the relevant art is different for the  patent than for the  patent and rejected the argument that dr karvelis possessed ordinary skill in the relevant art to the extent that extrinsic evidence is helpful in construing middle portion and bottom portion the construction of these terms by a person unskilled in the relevant art is entitled to little or no weight see arlaine  gina rockey  wl  at   preventing a witness unskilled in the relevant art from providing opinion testimony on claim construction dr karveliss constructions

construed to place the location of the jet spray nozzles in the reactor vessel pelican asserts that construing middle portion and bottom portion is intertwined with construing jet spray nozzles docket entry no  at  see also docket entry no  at  wright disagrees according to wright claim  of the  patent does not limit where the jet nozzles are located or where the liquid is extracted claim  requires only that the mixture is circulated from a middle portion into a bottom portion as such the middle portion and bottom portion relate to the mixture not the location of the structure such as jet spray nozzles docket entry no  at  at the motion hearing wright reiterated that the focus of the was on the mixtures circulation not on the nozzle location see docket entry no  at  wrights argument is consistent with the current record and the applicable law as counsel for pelican correctly noted at the motion hearing the claim specifically calls for the circulation path from the middle to the bottom id at  the focus is on mixture circulation not on nozzle location at the markman hearing dr king credibly testified that neither middle portion nor bottom portion required a more restrictive construction because of the claims focus on circulation see docket entry no  at  see also id at   dr kings testimony is confirmed by the claim as well as the specification see eg  patent col  ll  circulating part of the mixture from a middle portion of the reactor vessel into a bottom portion col ll focusing on the circulation and recirculation of the mixture pelicans narrower definition is required only if the location of the middle portion and bottom portion needs to be defined with far more specificity the record continues to show that a person possessing ordinary skill in the relevant art would understand middle portion and bottom portion under the courts previous construction of those terms and that a more restrictive definition is both unnecessary and not envisioned by the claim pelican reurges its argument that the courts construction of these terms makes the claims invalid the claims for indefiniteness pelican previously raised that argument the court previously analyzed it in detail and found it unpersuasive see docket entry no  at  pelican has presented no new evidence that requires a different conclusion the claims as construed are not indefinite pelicans motion for reconsideration of the construction of the claim terms middle portion and bottom portion is denied the court adheres to its previous construction of those terms as a result there is no need to construe reactor vessel as pelican urges c jet spray nozzles this court previously construed jet spray nozzles as devices or structures with an aperture capable of providing a propulsion spray of the material passing through it docket entry no  at  pelican had urged a narrower construction a plurality of devices each having a body an elongated nozzle tube extending from the body such that the nozzles provide a propulsion spray of the liquid mixture within the body of the liquid mixture in the reactor vessel which  promotes turbulence  increases pressure  simulates a boiling action in the liquid mixture and  allows the mixture to move upwardly through the reactor vessel without oxidation or air blowing id at  this court rejected pelicans proposed construction concluding that the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence supported defining the term based on the ordinary meaning to a person having ordinary skill in the art and modified by the use of the term in the claims id at  pelican appeared to be improperly importing limitations into the claim from its specification see id at  this court noted dr kings repeated and uncontroverted testimony that from the perspective of one skilled in the art the primary concern would be the ability of the nozzle to cause to propel the substance passing through it id at the same time the court recognized the possibility that it might need to revisit the construction of jet spray nozzles as the understanding of the technology evolved id at  in this motion for reconsideration pelican again seeks a narrower construction of this claim term as devices submerged within the liquid mixture having an aperture capable of providing a liquid jet to create turbulence and boiling within the mixture docket entry no  at  according to pelican this construction accomplishes five purposes  provides for the physical location of the devices in the process ie submerged within the liquid mixture of asphalt and whole tire rubber this is entirely consistent with the specification and the technical extrinsic evidence  provides for an aperture this feature is undisputed and in accord with the courts present construction  describes the devices as being capable of providing capable of is used in the courts present construction  shows that a liquid jet is completely in alignment with the specification and even the inventors testimony regarding turbulence and  requires the device to be capable of creating turbulence and boiling in the mixture both of which are clearly described in the specification and are supported by the inventors own testimony id pelicans revised proposed construction of jet spray nozzles relies almost entirely on the opinions of dr karvelis but dr karvelis does not possess ordinary skill in the relevant art he is an expert on fluid mechanics and fluid dynamics an expertise that supports a definition of jet spray nozzles in those fields but the patent claims and terms are not an invention in that field the ordinary and customary meaning of the claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question phillips  fd at  the task is to construe jet spray nozzles according to how a binder formulator or one who has worked for approximately a decade in a binder lab under a skilled binder formulator would construe the term pelican seeks to omit the word spray from the construction because according to dr karvelis spray    is a term thats associated with gases docket entry no  at  but that association is one made by someone who is knowledgeable about fluids not about asphalt formulation as this court noted in the hearing on this motion if you think about holding a garden hose into your kids swimming pool and filling the pool its a jet spray when i spray it into the air and its still a jet spray when i stick it under water thats my lay perception    to someone who is not an expert in fluids but who is perhaps one of ordinary skill in the asphalt world the term jet spray is not confusing or incorrectly applied even if the nozzle thats creating that jet spray is underneath liquid id dr karvelis and pelican would construe jet spray nozzles differently from how one possessing ordinary skill in the relevant art of the  and  patents—asphalt formulation—would construe the term as with the construction of the terms middle portion and bottom portion dr karveliss proposed construction of jet spray nozzles is entitled to little weight and as with the terms middle portion and bottom portion the extrinsic evidence continues to support applying an ordinary meaning to the term jet spray nozzles at the markman hearing pelican did not dispute—either through expert testimony or other evidence—dr kings repeated testimony that from the perspective of one skilled in the art the primary concern would be the ability of the nozzle to cause to propel the substance passing through it docket entry no  at  pelicans support for its current attempt to dispute that conclusion is dr karveliss testimony and expert report that is inadequate finally in large part the purposes that pelican identifies as supporting its proposed construction go to defining the term based on the specification as the federal circuit has explained the claims must be read in light of the specification but limitations must not be improperly imported from the specification into the claims phillips  fd at  pelicans construction does not attempt to read the claim in light of the specification as opposed to reading the specification into the claims one part of pelicans proposed revised claim construction is appropriate jet spray nozzles should include the phrase submerged within the liquid mixture at the markman hearing dr king testified that the exact location of the jet spray nozzles was irrelevant so long as both were below the surface of the liquid docket entry no  at  pelican did not present controverting testimony or evidence this interpretation is supported by the claims specification see  patent col ll the jet spray nozzles provide a propulsion spray of the liquid mixture within the body of the liquid mixture in the reactor vessel the intrinsic and extrinsic evidence however does not support reading further limitations from the specification into the construction of jet spray nozzles pelicans motion for reconsideration of the disputed term jet spray nozzles is granted in part and otherwise denied this court withdraws its previous construction of the term and replaces it with the following construction devices or structures submerged within the liquid mixture with an aperture capable of providing a propulsion spray of the material passing through it iii conclusion wrights motion to exclude the expert testimony of dr karvelis and steffe docket entry no  is granted in part and denied in part dr karvelis may not provide technicalexpert testimony at trial steffe may provide expert testimony at trial but limited to patent office practices and procedures generally pelicans motion to exclude the expert testimony of dr king docket entry no  is denied but without prejudice to reassertion following a daubert evidentiary hearing that hearing is scheduled for august   at  am in courtroom b pelicans motion for reconsideration of the terms middle portion and bottom portion docket entry no  is denied the court adheres to its prior construction of those terms pelicans motion for reconsideration of the term jet spray nozzles docket entry no  is granted in part and otherwise denied the revised construction of that term is as follows devices or structures submerged within the liquid mixture with an aperture capable of providing a propulsion spray of the material passing through it footnotes  see also wright asphalt prods co v pelican ref co civ a no h  wl  sd tex mar    in steffes words pelican retained him to render an opinion on whether a reasonable patent examiner if armed with knowledge of the information contained in the declaration and expert report of costandi a audeh    and the declaration and expert report of thomas r landon    would have  deemed claims   and  of united states patent no  hereinafter the  patent to be patentable over the disclosure of united states patent no  hereinafter the  patent and  deemed the disclosure of the  patent as providing enablement and written descriptive support for claims   and  as required by  usc §  first paragraph docket entry no  ex d at   if pelican is arguing that steffes experience and training give him ordinary skill in the art relevant to the  patents that assertion lacks merit steffe has no experience whatsoever in asphalt formulation he is not skilled in the relevant art of specialized processes for manufacturing asphalt products at the motion hearing pelican appeared to concede this obvious fact see docket entry no  at  explaining that even if steffes not one having any skill in whatever art area it is steffe relies on other technical experts in the area  this courts conclusion is bolstered by other cases cited by pelican those cases support the proposition that even when an attorney couches legal argument as expert testimony the court has complete discretion to adopt the legal opinion as its own to find guidance from it or to ignore it entirely or even to exclude it biomedical polymers inc v evergreen indus inc  fsupp   d mass  quoting markman  fd at  accord talarico  f supp d at  even absent the legal principles discussed above this court would exercise its discretion to exclude steffes expert report with the exception of its discussion of patent office practices and procedures generally as unhelpful to the court in deciding the issues of law  pelican has repeatedly called kings opinions junk science docket entry no  at  docket entry no  at  docket entry no  at  the pejorative is unnecessary pelicans briefing and arguments at the motion hearing make the issue perfectly clear king in his expert report has failed to provide a reliable foundation for his conclusions by failing to explain adequately how he arrived at those conclusions  in its motion pelican raised other grounds for excluding dr kings testimony including that his expert report conflicts with his testimony at the markman hearing see docket entry no  at  pelicans reply brief as well as its arguments during the motion hearing make clear that its central argument for exclusion is the lack of a reliable foundation for the conclusions stated in the report see docket entry no  docket entry no  at  the alternative grounds pelican raises go to the weight to be given dr kings expert opinions not to the threshold question of admissibility under daubert and kumho see ii ltd pship v microsoft corp  fd   fed cir  quoted infra  even if pelican had made such arguments the court would reject them  see aia engg ltd v magotteaux intl sa  fd   fed cir  explaining that the federal circuit generally views extrinsic evidence as less reliable than the patent and its prosecution history in determining how to read terms internal quotation marks omitted  pelican also faults this court for using the word shear in construing middle portion because the word shear is nowhere to be found in the specification docket entry no  at  claim terms do not need to be defined according only to words used in the specification doing so would be tautological  pelican disingenuously states that three witnesses including two experts dr albert karvelis pe pelican and dr gayle king wright as well as the inventor himself disagree with this courts construction of the term docket entry no  at  dr karvelis clearly disagrees with this courts construction but he lacks ordinary skill in the relevant art  in this motion pelican again argues that one possessing ordinary skill in the relevant art of the  patent is different than that of the  patent this court already rejected that argument above comment your
