used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and

used to help you increase your savings protect what youve saved or generate a stream of income have us call you annuities generally fall into two categories deferred and income each works differently and offers unique advantages taxdeferred annuities for retirement savings deferred annuities can be a good way to boost your retirement savings once youve made the maximum allowable contributions to your k or ira like any taxdeferred investment earnings compound over time providing growth opportunities that taxable accounts lack deferred annuities have no irs contribution limits so you can invest as much as you want for retirement you can also use your savings to create a guaranteed stream of income for retirement depending on how annuities are funded they may not have minimum required distributions mrds bear in mind that withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax and if taken before age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty annuities also come with annual charges not found in mutual funds which will affect your returns deferred variable annuities have funds that may have the potential for investment growth however this can involve some market risk and could result in losses if the value of the underlying investments falls variable annuities are usually appropriate for those with longer time horizons or those who are better able to handle market fluctuations some variable annuities allow you to protect your investment against loss while still participating in potential market growth deferred fixed annuities offer a guaranteed rate of return for a number of years fixed deferred annuities may be more suitable for conservative investors or for those interested in protecting assets from market volatility in this way they’re similar to certificates of deposit cds however deferred fixed annuities differ from cds in that annuities are not fdicinsured withdrawals from annuities prior to age ½ may be subject to a  irs penalty deferred fixed annuities may offer more access to assets than a cd annuity earnings compound on a taxdeferred basis income annuities for income in retirement income annuities may be appropriate for investors in or near retirement because they offer guaranteed income for life or a set period of time they may allow you to be more aggressive with other investments in your portfolio since they provide a lifetime income stream keep in mind that you may have limited or no access to the assets used to purchase income annuities immediate fixed income annuities offer a guaranteed predictable payment for life or for a certain period of time your guaranteed income payment cannot be affected by market volatility helping shield your retirement income from market risk a costofliving increase is available at an additional cost to help your buying power keep pace with inflation deferred income annuities are fixed income annuities that have a deferral period before income payments start because of the deferral period you may get a higher income payment amount than you would from a comparable immediate fixed income annuity with the same initial investment the costofliving increase is also available at an additional cost for deferred income annuities to buy or learn more   find an investor center  each individuals situation is unique and therefore seeking additional guidance from a tax advisor is suggested although variable annuities offer taxdeferral if you are considering one to fund a qualified retirement plan or ira you should do so for the variable annuitys features and benefits other than tax deferral in such cases tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the variable annuity references throughout this material to tax advantages such as tax deferral and taxfree
