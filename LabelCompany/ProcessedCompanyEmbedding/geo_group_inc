contractsedit on august   deputy us attorney general sally yates announced that the justice department intended to end its bureau of prisons contracts with forprofit prison operators because it concluded the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services than the federal bureau of prisons in a memorandum yates said that forprofit prisons compare poorly to our own bureau facilities they simply do not provide the same level of correctional services programs and resources they do not save substantially on costs and as noted in a recent report by the departments office of inspector general they do not maintain the same level of safety and security the rehabilitative services that the bureau provides such as educational programs and job training have proved difficult to replicate and outsource and these services are essential to reducing recidivism and improving public safety homeland security secretary jeh c johnson announced his department
