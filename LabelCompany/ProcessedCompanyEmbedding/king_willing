sara from wonderful bed with tons of storage i love this bed so much i bought it a second time when i moved the drawers are huge and hold so much i also love the way it looks the first time i bought it building it was no problem and everything was perfect the second time we had some issues putting together one section finally it worked and still have one drawer that doesnt slide properly so i guess that part varies putting it together is a ton of work but i think its worth it for this bed the only thing is even with the drawers taken out its super heavy if youre planning to move yourself it might not be the best bed to get if you hire movers im sure its okay date published  rated  out of  by lindz from had for  years and still love it i live in a city and storage is king this has added an entire closet to my bedroom weve packed the drawers full with heavy stuff and have had no problems what so ever weve also found that behind the drawers there is a little more hidden space if you are willing to lift the mattress and slats to get to it we bought the cheapest slats first and that was a mistake once we upgraded it was amazing moving it is a pain you have to disassmeble everything once assembled thats it its in no moving it around we are going to upgrade to a king and buy this again ive researched other options but this has the most storage and simplest design we were even willing to pay a couple  for an upgraded version but non were exactly what we wanted or didnt have the same enormous storage highly recommend date published  rated  out of  by sarahr from do not buy this bed whatever you dodo not buy this bed an absolute nightmare to put together came with missing pieces and screws that were already worn to the point that they could not even be fully screwed in given the wrong pieces for drawer assembly but even if the drawers parts were given to me correctly i would not be able to use the drawers as the loose screws prevented the wheel axles from properly working tried calling ikea customer service and they were utterly clueless and of no help got transferred multiple times for no apparent reason and each representative seemed incredibly annoyed to even have to deal with my issues date published  rated  out of  by shannaa from a lot of storage space we purchased this bed  years ago for the added storage space it is has been a good bed frame my only compliant is that there is nothing covering the top of the drawers underaround the mattress so you have to keep your linens or whatever you store in the drawer in a zipper bag to protect it from the dirt and dust that falls into the drawer around the edge of the mattress date published  rated  out of  by lori from love it we purchased this bed a couple years ago we put an older mattress on the frame and it felt like new again the storage drawers are fantasticlots of space i love this frame so much i bought my nd one  months agoand im going to purchase my rd today date published  rated  out of  by the guy from never try to move it comfortable and spacious at first but if you ever try to move with without disassembling it breaks with the slightest motion then if you try to get replacement parts there is no place to buy them on ikeas website so after you move it its trashed date published  rated  out of  by kthom from do not buy while the storage is nice on the bed that is the only positive drawer handles stick out so you cut your legs when you get out of bed same goes for the corners the drawers didnt stay aligned long and became difficult to open and close difficult to assemble and all the boxes are super heavy and awkward save your money seriously date published  rated  out of  by tageo from amazing value lots of room for storage and was easy to move

king’s new ad forces google home to advertise the whopper new  comments oh no google by jacob kastrenakes apr   pm edt share tweet linkedin burger king is unveiling a horrible genius infuriating hilarious and maybe very poorly thoughtout ad today that’s designed to intentionally set off google homes and android phones the second ad features someone in a burger king uniform leaning into the camera before saying “ok google what is the whopper burger” for anyone with a google home near their tv that strangely phrased request will prompt the speaker to begin reading the wikipedia entry for the whopper it’s a clever way of getting viewers’ attention but it’s also a really quick way of getting on viewers’ nerves — just look at the reactions people had when ads accidentally triggered voice assistants in the past burger king’s ad relies on wikipedia which is maybe not a good idea while burger king is far from the first to recognize that it’s possible to mess with someone else’s smart speaker it’s certainly the first to put it into a widely run ad campaign the spot is supposed to begin running in primetime slots across the us today on networks including history spike comedy central mtv e and bravo and it will air during adult swim the tonight show and jimmy kimmel live google wasn’t involved in the ad’s creation that means this isn’t an expansion of google’s ad tests people weren’t happy when google built a beauty and the beast ad into the speaker but it also leads to some real issues for burger king for one it has to use weird phrasing — “what is the whopper burger” — because that’s the query that actually gets the result it wants asking “what is a whopper” gets you the definition of the word “whopper” and then there’s the bigger problem google gets its explanation of the whopper from wikipedia and as we all know anyone’s free to edit wikipedia it actually looks like burger king went and edited the whopper entry ahead of this ad being run for almost a decade wikipedia’s page for the whopper began with more or less the same sentence “the whopper sandwich is the signature hamburger product sold by the international fastfood restaurant chain burger king and its australian franchise hungry jacks” burger king’s marketing chief seems to have edited wikipedia to improve the ad but last week that first line — the only line that google home reads — was changed to “the whopper is a burger consisting of a flamegrilled patty made with  percent beef with no preservatives or fillers topped with sliced tomatoes onions lettuce pickles ketchup and mayonnaise served on a sesameseed bun” that certainly sounds like ad copy and all evidence suggests burger king is behind the edit the line was first added by someone with the username “fermachado” which appears to be the username of burger king’s marketing chief fernando machado he uses the same name on instagram and an almost identical name on twitter a press representative for the company stopped responding when asked about the edit wikipedia specifically asks that editors “avoid shameless selfpromotion” while making changes and this very much seems to break the rule relying on wikipedia also opens up one other problem anyone can edit it the verge modified the whopper entry briefly and google home began speaking the updated text only minutes later smart speakers keep getting triggered by accident with this ad airing nationally burger king is opening the door for an editing war — and it risks having a malicious editor make the google home say something inappropriate when explaining the whopper those risks will certainly make for an interesting if frustrating ad campaign burger king is taking advantage of something here that’s been happening for months commercials news anchors and other voices on tv keep triggering the google home and amazon’s alexa by accident “ok google” could trigger some android phones too though android has an option to only respond to a specific voice in one instance a news report led to alexas ordering dollhouses the whole thing seems avoidable but so far google and amazon haven’t added voicerecognition to their smart speakers until that changes these accidents are going to keep happening — and other advertisers willing to risk annoying you may see an opportunity update april th pm et google appears to have intervened and stopped the home from responding to burger king’s commercial the whopper’s wikipedia page has also been reverted to its pread state and the page has been locked amid an editing war next up in tech elon musk dismisses mark zuckerberg’s
