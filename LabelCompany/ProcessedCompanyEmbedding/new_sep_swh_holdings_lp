prospectus supplement the accompanying prospectus and any related free writing prospectus together with all documents incorporated by reference herein and therein carefully including the risk factors section of this prospectus supplement and in our annual report on form k for the year ended january   and our consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement who we are we are a highgrowth outdoor sporting goods retailer focused on meeting the everyday needs of the seasoned outdoor veteran the firsttime participant and every enthusiast in between our mission is to provide a onestop shopping experience that equips our customers with the right quality brand name hunting shooting fishing and camping gear to maximize their enjoyment of the outdoors we strive to accomplish this goal by tailoring our broad and deep merchandise assortment to meet local conditions and demand offering everyday low prices providing friendly support from our knowledgeable highly trained staff and offering extensive instore events and educational programming these core strategies help position sportsmans warehouse as the local outdoor experts and the preferred place to both shop and share outdoorbased experiences in the communities we serve as a result we are expanding our loyal customer base in existing markets and increasing our store footprint in new markets which we believe will further drive our growth and profitability we were founded in  as a single retail store in midvale utah and have grown to  stores across  states as of april   today we have the largest outdoor specialty store base in the western united states and alaska our stores range from  to  gross square feet with an average size of approximately  gross square feet our store layout is adaptable to both standalone locations and strip centers based on publicly available information we believe it is less capitalintensive for us to open new stores compared to our principal competitors because our no frills store layout requires less initial cash investment to build out and our stores generally require less square footage than the stores of our competitors together these features enable us to effectively serve markets of multiple sizes from metropolitan statistical areas msas with populations of less than  to major metropolitan areas with populations in excess of  while generating consistent fourwall adjusted ebitda margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes we believe that the foregoing attributes have positioned us to deliver strong financial results as evidenced by the following        organic store unit growth of  over the past three fiscal years representing a compound annual growth rate of         strong and consistent new store performance with an average fourwall adjusted ebitda margin of  and an average pretax return on invested capital roic of  excluding initial inventory cost and  including initial inventory cost in the first twelve months of operations for our  stores opened since  that have been open for a full twelve months excluding the  stores acquired during this period and        net sales of  million for fiscal year  representing a compound annual growth rate of  from net sales of  million for fiscal year  fourwall adjusted ebitda means for any period a particular stores adjusted ebitda excluding any allocations of corporate selling general and administrative expenses allocated to that store fourwall adjusted     s table of contents ebitda margin means for any period a stores fourwall adjusted ebitda divided by that stores net sales for a definition of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin and a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda see summary historical consolidated financial and operating data roic means a stores fourwall adjusted ebitda for a given period divided by our initial cash investment in the store we calculate roic both including and excluding the initial inventory cost our industry we compete in the large growing and fragmented outdoor activities and sporting goods market which we believe is currently underserved by fullline multiactivity retailers we believe based on reports by the national sporting goods association nsga and other industry sources that us outdoor activities and sporting goods retail sales totaled over  billion in  the us outdoor activities and sporting goods sector is comprised of three primary categoriesequipment clothing and footwearwith each category containing distinct product sets to support a variety of activities including hunting fishing camping and shooting as well as other sporting goods activities we believe growth in the us outdoor activities and sporting goods market is driven by several key trends including an expanding demographic focused on healthy and active lifestyles successful new product introductions centered around enhancing performance and enjoyment while participating in sporting and outdoor activities and the resilience of consumer demand for purchases in these categories versus other discretionary categories we believe these factors will continue to foster growth in the outdoor activities and sporting goods market in the future within the retail sporting goods sector we operate primarily in the outdoor equipment clothing and footwear segment which includes hunting and shooting fishing camping and boating this segment is growing at a faster rate than the sporting goods industry at large the  us fish and wildlife national survey published once every five years found that hunting and shooting and fishing participation increased  and  respectively for americans aged  and older from  to  this survey also found that fishing participation among women increased by  over the same time period a  nsga report indicated that from  to  there was a  increase in hunting with firearms participation a  increase in target shooting live ammunition participation a  increase in fishing fresh water participation a  increase in female participation in target shooting live ammo and an  increase in female participation in fishing fresh water in the united states furthermore we believe that specialty retailers have generated additional sales volume by expanding their presence especially in smaller communities which has increased customers access to products that formerly were less available the nature of the outdoor activities to which we cater requires recurring purchases throughout the year resulting in high rates of conversion among customers for example active anglers typically purchase various fishing tackle throughout the year based on seasons and changing conditions hunting with firearms typically is accompanied by recurring purchases of ammunition and cleaning supplies throughout the year and multiple firearm styles for different hunted game our competitive strengths we believe the following competitive strengths allow us to capitalize on the growth opportunity within the outdoor activities and sporting goods market differentiated shopping experience for the seasoned outdoor veteran the firsttime participant and every enthusiast in between  we place great emphasis on creating an inviting and engaging store experience for customers of all experience levels for the seasoned outdoor veteran we offer a onestop convenient store layout     s table of contents that promotes easyin easyout access to replenish supplies learn about local conditions and test products we also serve firsttime participants and casual users who are interested in enjoying the outdoors but enter our store without a clear sense for what equipment they need for their chosen activity our highly trained employees who often are outdoor enthusiasts themselves and users of the products we sell engage and interact with our customers in order to educate them and equip them with the right gear our sales associates draw upon both formal vendor sales training as well as firsthand experiences from using our products in local conditions this selling approach allows us to offer a broad range of products and to deliver a shopping experience centered on the customers needs which we believe results in increased customer loyalty repeat visits and frequent referrals to other potential customers a customers shopping experience in our stores is further enhanced by a variety of helpful instore offerings and features including the issuance of hunting and fishing licenses local fishing reports availability of sportsmans news our proprietary instore newspaper access to the braggin board where customers can post photos of their outdoor adventures indoor test ranges for archery equipment and displays of customerowned taxidermy in addition we host a variety of instore programs such as ladies night contests such as bucks  bulls a freetoenter biggame trophy contest and a wide range of instructional seminars from turkey frying to firearm operation and safety these programs are all designed to help our customers connect with the outdoors and build the skill sets necessary to maximize enjoyment of their chosen activities as a result we believe our stores often serve as gathering spots where local enthusiasts can share stories product knowledge and advice on outdoor recreation activities which both drives traffic and fosters customer loyalty locally relevant merchandise serving the comprehensive needs of outdoor enthusiasts at a compelling value  we offer our customers an extensive and carefully selected assortment of branded highquality outdoor products at competitive prices we accomplish this in three principal ways        locally relevant merchandise we carry over  skus on average in each store out of a pool of approximately  total skus sku is an acronym for stock keeping units which are unique alphanumeric identifiers assigned to a particular product that allow it to be tracked for inventory purposes each stores merchandise is tailored to meet local conditions and consumer demand taking into account seasonal requirements regional game and fishing species geographic diversity weather patterns and key demographic factors so that our customers have the right product at the right time for the right location        breadth and mix of product assortment our merchandise strategy is designed to serve a variety of purchasing occasions from bigticket items to replenishment activity as well as to meet the wideranging needs of customers from firsttime participants to seasoned outdoor veterans we pride ourselves on carrying an extensive selection of branded good better and best hard goods at everyday low prices including a broad array of instock consumable items approximately  of our unit sales and  of our dollar sales during fiscal year  were consumable goods such as ammunition bait cleaning supplies food lures propane and reloading supplies we believe this pairing of product breadth and consumable goods appeals to a broad range of customers and drives both repeat traffic and increased average ticket value        strong vendor relationships we believe our vendors find our brandcentric highservice store concept to be unique among national specialty outdoor retailers our attractive store locations consistent presentation of merchandise and thorough product training present a compelling opportunity for our vendors to offer their brands to local markets that historically have been served primarily by mom  pop retailers as a result we believe we are able to negotiate terms with our vendors that are similar to those offered to our principal competitors that are larger in size we share the benefits of these strategic vendor relationships with our customers through better pricing and enhanced access to certain products that are limited in production     s table of contents flexible and adaptable real estate strategy  we believe that our store model combined with our rigorous site selection process is uniquely customizable to address the needs of the different markets we serve our stores can vary in size from approximately  to  gross square feet we have had success with leasing existing sites as well as constructing new buildtosuit sites our flexible store model permits us to serve both large metropolitan areas like phoenix arizona and smaller msas like soldotna alaska while generating consistent fourwall adjusted ebitda margins and returns on invested capital across a range of store sales volumes in small to mediumsized markets we are often able to establish ourselves as a standalone destination for our customers in larger markets we have successfully leveraged existing infrastructure to open stores in shopping plazas near complementary retailers drawing upon existing foot traffic we believe our lowcost flexible model allows us to access both large and small markets more economically than many of our peers we maintain a disciplined approach to new store development and perform comprehensive market research before selecting a new site including partnering with specialized thirdparty local real estate firms we select sites based on criteria such as local demographics traffic patterns density of hunting and fishing license holders in the area abundance of hunting and fishing game and outdoor recreation activities store visibility and accessibility purchase data from our existing customer database and availability of attractive lease terms we have established productive relationships with wellregarded commercial real estate firms and believe that we are a soughtafter tenant given the strength of the sportsmans warehouse brand the high volume of customers that visit our stores and our flexible approach to site locations as a result we continue to have access to desirable retail sites on attractive terms low cost operating structure with attractive and replicable store economics  we strive to maintain a lower operating cost structure than our principal competitors which allows us to serve small to mediumsized markets as well as larger msas we achieve this by exercising tight control over storelevel expenses real estate costs and corporate overhead in addition our growing store base efficient localized marketing spend and no frills warehouse store layout help us maintain comparatively low operating costs and provide us with the opportunity to achieve fourwall adjusted ebitda margins of  or more for stores in most new markets our typical new store requires an average net investment of approximately  million which includes store buildout net of contributions from landlords and preopening cash expenditures in addition we stock each new store with initial inventory at an average cost of approximately  million we target a pretax return on invested capital within one year after opening of over  excluding initial inventory cost or over  including initial inventory cost although our historical returns have often exceeded these thresholds as of the end of fiscal year  all of our stores that had been open for more than twelve months were profitable and those stores had an average adjusted ebitda margin of  we believe this lowcost capitalefficient approach also allows us to successfully serve markets that are not wellsuited for the more capitalintensive store models of our principal competitors approximately  of our markets currently lack another nationally recognized outdoor specialty retailer which we believe is a result of these dynamics significant new store growth opportunity within existing and new markets  we operate  stores across  states primarily in the western united states and alaska with a presence in these markets that is nearly three times that of the next largest outdoor retailer we believe our leadership position in the western united states combined with our existing scalable infrastructure provides a strong foundation for continued expansion within our core markets over the longer term we believe our distinct retail concept has the potential to expand to more than  locations throughout the united states based on research conducted for us by buxton company an independent consumer research and analytics firm passionate and experienced management team with proven track record  we are focused on delivering an unsurpassed shopping experience to anyone who enjoys the excitement of the outdoors this passion and commitment is shared by team members throughout our entire organization from senior management to the employees in our stores our senior management team has an average of  years of retail experience with extensive capabilities across a broad range of disciplines including merchandising real estate finance     s table of contents compliance store operations supply chain management and information technology we also pride ourselves on the long tenure of our more than  store managers and corporate employees who have been with us for an average of approximately  years our growth strategy we are pursuing a number of strategies designed to continue our growth and strong financial performance including expanding our store base  we believe that our compelling new store economics and our track record of opening successful new stores provide a strong foundation for continued growth through new store openings in existing adjacent and new markets over the last three fiscal years we have opened an average of seven stores per year excluding acquired stores we have opened three new stores to date in fiscal year  and currently plan to open an additional eight new stores in the remainder of fiscal year  for the next several years thereafter we intend to grow our store base at a rate of greater than  percent annually and expect that most of our nearterm growth will occur within the western united states our longerterm plans include expanding our store base to serve the outdoor needs of enthusiasts in markets across the united states we believe our existing infrastructure including distribution information technology loss prevention and employee training is capable of sustaining  or more stores without significant additional capital investment increasing same store sales growth  we are committed to increasing same store sales through a number of ongoing and new initiatives including expansion of our clothing offerings and private label program such as our recently introduced proprietary rustic ridge tm  and killik clothing lines our loyalty program the implementation of kiosks and mobile pointofsale in our stores and expansion of our storewithinastore programs with major brands such as carhartt columbia sportswear and under armour each of these initiatives is designed to foster additional shopping convenience add deeper merchandise selection and provide more product information to the customer we believe these initiatives will drive additional traffic improve conversion and increase average ticket value continuing to enhance our operating margins  we believe that our planned expansion of our store base and growth in same store sales will result in improved adjusted ebitda margins as we take advantage of economies of scale in product sourcing and leverage our existing infrastructure supply chain corporate overhead and other fixed costs furthermore we expect to increase our gross profit margin by expanding product offerings in our private label program including our recently introduced proprietary rustic ridge tm  and killik clothing lines and continuing marketing initiatives in our highermargin clothing and footwear departments growing the sportsmans warehouse brand  we are committed to supporting our stores product offerings and brand through a variety of marketing programs private label offerings and corporate partnerships our marketing and promotional

bankruptcy code seeking to reorganize the business under the provisions of the bankruptcy code the plan of reorganization under the bankruptcy code was confirmed by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware on july   and became effective when all material conditions of the plan of reorganization were satisfied on august   we incurred certain costs related to our restructuring and emergence from chapter  bankruptcy and included a liability as part of the reorganization value at august   the date of emergence from bankruptcy bankruptcyrelated expenses are those amounts that are greater than the initial estimated restructuring costs whereas bankruptcyrelated benefits are those amounts that are less than the initial estimated costs they are expensed as incurred  adjusted ebitda has been presented in this prospectus supplement as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap we define adjusted ebitda as net income plus interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization stockbased compensation expense preopening expenses and other gains losses and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing expenses adjusted ebitda margin means for any period the adjusted ebitda for that period divided by the net sales for that period adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are included in this prospectus supplement because they are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry in addition to assessing our financial performance we use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as additional measurement tools for purposes of business decisionmaking including evaluating store performance developing budgets and managing expenditures adjusted ebitda is not a gaap measure of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap and it should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items additionally adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for managements discretionary use as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments debt service requirements capital expenditures store openings and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future adjusted ebitda contains certain other limitations including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments in evaluating adjusted ebitda you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments reflected in this presentation such as income tax expense benefit interest expense depreciation and amortization and preopening expenses our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed to imply that our future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments management compensates for these limitations by relying on our gaap results in addition to using adjusted ebitda supplementally our measures of adjusted ebitda are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation     s table of contents a reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda is set forth below        fiscal year ended        january

completion of our ipo and pursuant to the terms of the employment agreements with our executive officers we paid  million in bonuses to our executive officers   d on march   a jury awarded  million against the defendants in the litigation discussed in note  to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended january   which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement we reviewed the decision and accrued  million in our results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended january   related to this matter we strongly disagreed with the jurys verdict and filed posttrial motions seeking to have the verdict set aside on july   the court granted our motion for judgment as a matter of law the plaintiff has appealed the july   ruling to the appellate court and the appeal is currently in process based on the courts most recent judgment in our favor we determined that the likelihood of loss in this case is not probable and as such we reversed the previous accrual of  million in our results for the fiscal year ended january   the reversal of the  million accrual is recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in our statements of income which appear in the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement   e we incurred certain costs related to our restructuring and emergence from chapter  bankruptcy and included a liability as part of the reorganization value at august   the date of emergence from bankruptcy bankruptcyrelated expenses are those amounts that are

involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information in this prospectus supplement and the documents incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement including the factors discussed under the heading risk factors in our most recent annual report on form k and each subsequently filed quarterly report on form q and any risk factors set forth in our other filings with the sec pursuant to sections a c  or d of the exchange act before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common stock see where you can find more information and information we incorporate by reference the occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business financial condition results of operations and growth prospects in such an event the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment risks related to our common stock and this offering seidler will beneficially own approximately  of our common stock after this offering and its interests may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder after the completion of this offering seidler will beneficially own approximately  of our common stock or approximately  if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full as a result seidler will continue to have significant influence over the election of all of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions that require the approval of our board of directors or stockholders such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets so long as seidler continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock it will have the ability to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions seidler may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders including investors in this offering by among other things        delaying deferring or preventing a change in control transaction        entrenching our management andor our board of directors        impeding a merger consolidation takeover or other business combination involving us        discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us or        causing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders additionally seidler is in the business of making investments in companies and may in the future acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers seidler may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us seidler and the members of our board of directors who are affiliated with seidler by the terms of our certificate of incorporation are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors we by the terms of our certificate of incorporation expressly renounce any interest in any such corporate opportunity to the extent permitted under applicable law even if the opportunity is one that we would reasonably be deemed to have pursued if given the opportunity to do so unless such opportunity is expressly offered to any director or officer in his or her capacity as our director or officer our certificate of incorporation cannot be amended to eliminate our renunciation of any such corporate opportunity arising prior to the date of any such amendment seidler or its affiliates may also acquire competing businesses that may not be attractive to us and have no obligation to refrain from acquiring competing businesses any competition could intensify if an affiliate or subsidiary of seidler were to enter into or acquire a business similar to our specialty retail operations seidler or its affiliates may enter into or acquire a competing business in the future   s table of contents although we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq stock market corporate governance standards we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a oneyear transition period affiliates of seidler no longer control a majority of our outstanding common stock as a result we are no longer a controlled company within the meaning of the nasdaq stock market corporate governance standards the nasdaq stock market corporate governance requirements require that        a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors as defined under the nasdaq stock market corporate governance standards        our director nominees be selected or recommended for our board of directors selection either  by a majority of independent directors in a vote by independent directors pursuant to a nominations process adopted by a board resolution or  by a nominating and governance committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the nominations process and        the compensation of our executive officers be determined or recommended to the board for determination by a majority of independent directors in a vote by independent directors or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors currently a majority of our board of directors consists of independent directors and we have an audit committee and a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors however our nominating and governance committee is not comprised solely of independent directors the rules of the nasdaq stock market require that our nominating and governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors within one year of the closing of our secondary public offering in september  the date we ceased to be a controlled company or by september   during this transition period however we could avail ourselves of any of the exemptions described above even if we are not currently relying upon them accordingly during this transition period you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the nasdaq stock market corporate governance standards our bylaws and our certificate of incorporation contain and delaware law contains provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and amended and restated certificate of incorporation may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares in addition these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors these provisions include        establishing a classified board of directors        providing that directors may be removed only for cause        not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors        requiring at least a supermajority vote of our stockholders to amend our bylaws or certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation        eliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders        establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings        prohibiting stockholder action by written consent and        authorizing the issuance of blank check preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders   s table of contents in addition we will be subject to section  of the delaware general corporation law once seidler ceases to beneficially own at least  of the total voting power of our thenoutstanding shares of common stock in general subject to some exceptions section  prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder which is generally defined as an entity or person who together with the persons affiliates and associates beneficially owns or within three years prior to the time of determination of interested stockholder status did own  or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation for a threeyear period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder section  could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests further our certificate of incorporation provides that subject to limited exceptions the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be to the fullest extent permitted by law the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine this exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees and agents which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers employees and agents together these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock the existence of the foregoing provisions and antitakeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock they could also deter potential acquirers of our company thereby potentially reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition the price of our common stock may be volatile and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the offering price volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your common stock at or above the price you paid for your common stock since the completion of our ipo in april  the price of our stock has ranged from  to  per share the market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons including        our operating and financial performance and prospects including seasonal fluctuations in our financial performance        conditions that impact demand for our products        the publics reaction to our press releases other public announcements and filings with the sec        changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock        market and industry perception of our success or lack thereof in pursuing our growth strategy        strategic actions by us or our competitors such as acquisitions or restructurings        changes in federal and state government regulation        changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles        arrival or departure of key personnel        sales of common stock by us or members of our management team and        changes in general market economic and political conditions in the united states and global economies or financial markets including those resulting from natural disasters terrorist attacks acts of war and responses to such events   s table of contents in addition if the market for stocks in our industry or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business financial condition or results of operations if any of the foregoing occurs it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that even if unsuccessful could be costly to defend and distract our management future sales of our common stock or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or are perceived by the public market as intending to sell the trading price of our common stock could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we are an egc within the meaning of the jobs act and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to egcs may make our common stock less attractive to investors because we qualify as an egc under the jobs act we have elected to comply with some of the reduced disclosure and other reporting requirements available to us as an egc for a period of up to five years following our initial public offering if we remain an egc for example for as long as we remain an egc we are not subject to certain governance requirements such as holding a sayonpay and sayongoldenparachute advisory votes we are not required to include a compensation discussion and analysis section in our proxy statements and reports filed under the exchange act and we do not need to obtain an annual attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting from a registered public accounting firm pursuant to section b of the sarbanesoxley act we could be an egc for a period up to the end of the fifth fiscal year after our ipo although we will cease to be an egc earlier than this fiveyear period if our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed  billion in a fiscal year if we issue more than  billion in nonconvertible debt over a threeyear period or if we become a large accelerated filer which requires among other things the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates to be at least  million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter of any fiscal year accordingly for up to five fiscal years after our ipo our stockholders may not receive the same level of disclosure that is afforded to stockholders of a nonegc it is possible that investors will find our common stock to be less attractive because we have elected to comply with the reduced disclosure and other reporting requirements available to us as an egc which could adversely affect the trading market for our common stock and the prices at which stockholders may be able to sell their common stock the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention as a public company we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources the exchange act requires among other things that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and proxy or information statements in connection with matters upon which our stockholders may vote as a result of our public disclosure of information in filings required of a public company our business and financial condition have become more visible which could result in threatened or actual litigation or other adverse actions taken by competitors and other third parties in addition our management team has limited experience managing a public company or complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies and a number of our directors have limited experience serving on the boards of public companies the time and resources necessary to comply with the requirements of being a public company and contend with any action that might be brought against us as a result of publicly available information could divert our resources and the attention of our management and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations   s table of contents we do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future we currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings if any for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions including under the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and agreements governing any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends and will depend upon among other factors our results of operations financial condition earnings capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant further because we are a holding company our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under our existing or future indebtedness all of our business operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries sportsmans warehouse inc and minnesota merchandising corporation and their subsidiaries the ability of sportsmans warehouse inc and minnesota merchandising corporation to pay dividends to us and our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock is limited by our term loans our revolving credit facility also limits our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries accordingly if you purchase shares in this offering you may not realize any returns on your investment unless the price of our common stock appreciates which may never occur investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us our stock price and trading volume could decline the trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us our business and our industry assuming we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us our business or our industry our stock price would likely decline if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline   s table of

treasury regulations to be treated as a us person distributions on our common stock as described in the section titled dividend policy we currently do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future if however we make cash or other property distributions on our common stock such distributions will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current earnings and profits for that taxable year or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles amounts not treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and will first be applied against and reduce a holders adjusted tax basis in our common stock but not below zero any excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of our common stock and will be treated as described below under gain on sale or other disposition of our common stock any dividend paid to a nonus holder of our common stock generally will be subject to us federal withholding tax at a rate of  of the gross amount of the dividend or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty to receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate a nonus holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid irs form wben or wbene or other applicable form certifying under penalties of perjury such holders qualification for the reduced rate this certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically if the nonus holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the nonus holders behalf the nonus holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent which then will be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent either directly or through other intermediaries nonus holders that do not timely provide us or our paying agent with the required certification but qualify for a reduced treaty rate may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the irs nonus holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding possible entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty if a nonus holder provides an irs form weci certifying that the dividend is effectively connected with such holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states and if required by an applicable income tax treaty is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the nonus holder in the united states the dividend will not be subject to the aforementioned us federal withholding tax instead the dividend generally will be subject to us federal income tax in the manner described below under effectively connected income   s table of contents gain on sale or other disposition of our common stock except as otherwise discussed below a nonus holder generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock unless        the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by the nonus holder in the united states and if an income tax treaty applies the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the nonus holder in the united states        the nonus

capital losses of the nonus holder provided the nonus holder has timely and properly filed us federal income tax returns with respect to such losses with respect to the third bullet point above we believe we are not currently and do not anticipate becoming a usrphc for us federal income tax purposes however because the determination of whether we are a usrphc depends on the fair market value of our us real property relative to the fair market value of our other business assets and our foreign real property interests there can be no assurance we are not or will not become a usrphc in the future if we are or become a usrphc so long as our common stock is considered regularly traded on an established securities market only a nonus holder that actually or constructively holds or held more than  of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the fiveyear period ending on the date of the sale or other taxable disposition or the nonus holders holding period for our stock will be subject to us federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock if gain on the sale or other taxable disposition of our common stock were subject to taxation under the third bullet point above any such taxable gain recognized by the nonus holder would be taxed in the same manner as gain described in effectively connected income below except that the branch profits tax would not apply effectively connected income any dividend with respect to or gain realized upon the sale exchange or other taxable disposition of our common stock that is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by a nonus holder within the united states and if an income tax treaty applies that is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by such nonus holder in the united states will be subject to us federal income tax based on the nonus holders net income generally in the same manner as if the nonus holder were a us person for us federal income tax purposes if a dividend or gain is effectively connected with a us trade or business of a nonus holder that is a corporation such corporate nonus holder may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty subject to certain adjustments nonus holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that

general corporation law for additional information we refer you to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and such sections of the delaware general corporation law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that are intended to enhance the likelihood of continuity and stability in the composition of our board of directors and that could make it more difficult to acquire control of our company by means of a tender offer open market purchases a proxy contest or otherwise we expect that these provisions which are summarized below will discourage coercive takeover practices or inadequate takeover bids these provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors which we believe may result in an improvement of the terms of any such acquisition in favor of our stockholders however they also give our board of directors the power to discourage acquisitions that some stockholders may favor a description of these provisions is set forth below classified board our certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors other than those directors elected by the holders of any series of preferred stock will be divided into three classes with staggered threeyear terms only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective threeyear terms because our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding will be able to elect all of our directors a third party may be discouraged from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is more difficult and timeconsuming for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board removal of directors only for cause our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that except for any director elected by the holders of any series of preferred stock directors can be removed only for cause once seidler ceases to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing a majority of the total voting power of our thenoutstanding shares of capital stock special meetings of stockholders our bylaws provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors or by the chairman of the board of directors the chief executive officer if any or the president stockholders are not permitted to call a

majority of our board of directors no cumulative voting under delaware law the right to vote cumulatively does not exist unless the certificate of incorporation specifically authorizes cumulative voting our certificate of incorporation does not grant stockholders the right to vote cumulatively therefore stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding are able to elect all of our directors no written consent of stockholders our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that once seidler owns less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock all stockholder actions other than those actions required or permitted to be taken by holders of any thenoutstanding series of preferred stock are required to be taken by a vote of the stockholders at an annual or special meeting and that stockholders may not take any action by written consent in lieu of a meeting advance notice procedure our bylaws provide that our board of directors the chairman of the board of directors the chief executive officer if any or the president may call special meetings of stockholders and only those matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be

meeting our bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or bring other business before an annual or special meeting

conducted at the meeting as applicable blank check preferred stock our certificate of incorporation provides for  authorized shares of preferred stock the existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock may enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger tender offer proxy contest or otherwise for example if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations our board of directors were to determine that a takeover proposal is not in the best interest of us and our stockholders our board of directors could cause shares of preferred stock to be issued without stockholder approval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder    table of contents group in this regard our certification of incorporation grants our board of directors broad power to establish the rights and preferences of authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock the issuance of shares of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of shares of common stock the issuance may also adversely affect the rights and powers including voting rights of these holders and may have the effect of delaying deterring or preventing a change in control of us authorized but unissued shares under delaware law our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval we may use these additional shares for a variety of corporate purposes including future public offerings to raise additional capital corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans the existence of authorized but

general corporation law our certificate of incorporation elects not to be subject to section  of the delaware general corporation law until such time as seidler ceases to beneficially own shares of our common stock representing at least  of the total voting power of our thenoutstanding shares of capital stock accordingly we are not subject to any antitakeover effects of section  in general section  prohibits a publiclyheld delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a threeyear period following the time that this stockholder becomes an interested stockholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner a business combination includes among other things a merger asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder an interested stockholder is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or did own within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status  or more of the corporations voting stock under section  a business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder is prohibited unless it satisfies one of the following conditions        before the stockholder became interested the board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder        upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder the interested stockholder owned at least  of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding shares owned by persons who are directors and also officers and employee stock plans in some instances or        at or after the time the stockholder became interested the business combination was approved by the board of directors of the corporation and authorized at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder corporate opportunities our largest stockholder seidler is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us corporate opportunities may therefore arise in the area of potential acquisitions of competitive businesses that may be attractive to us as well as to seidler seidler and members of our board of directors affiliated with seidler and its affiliates by the terms of our certificate of incorporation will not to the fullest extent permitted by law be required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment unless such opportunity

writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be to the fullest extent permitted by law the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the delaware general corporation law or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine the overall effect of the foregoing provisions may be to deter a future tender offer stockholders might view such an offer to be in their best interest should the offer include a substantial premium over the market price of our common stock at that time in addition these provisions may have the effect of assisting our management to retain its position and place it in a better position to resist changes that the stockholders may want to make if dissatisfied with the conduct of our business limitation on liability of directors and officers our certificate of incorporation limits the liability of directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law the effect of these provisions is to eliminate the rights of us and our stockholders through stockholders derivative suits on behalf of us to recover monetary damages from a director for breach of fiduciary duty as a director including breaches resulting from grossly negligent behavior however exculpation does not apply to any director if the director has acted in bad faith knowingly or intentionally violated the law authorized illegal dividends or redemptions or derived an improper benefit from his or her actions as a director in addition our certificate of incorporation allows and our bylaws require that we indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law we also expect to continue to maintain directors and officers liability insurance we believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and executive officers the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duty these provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders in addition to the indemnification in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and officers these agreements provide for the indemnification of our directors and officers for all reasonable expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with any action or proceeding brought against them by reason of the fact that they are or were our agents we believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements as well as our maintaining directors and officers liability insurance help to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers transfer agent and registrar
