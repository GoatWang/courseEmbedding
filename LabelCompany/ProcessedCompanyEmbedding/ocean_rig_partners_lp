by approximately  million the offshore drilling industry is highly competitive with market participants ranging from large multinational companies to smaller companies like us with fewer than five drilling units the demand for offshore drilling services is driven by oil and natural gas companies’ exploration and development drilling programs these drilling programs are affected by oil and natural gas companies’ expectations regarding oil and natural gas prices anticipated production levels worldwide demand for oil and natural gas products and many other factors the availability of quality drilling prospects exploration success availability of qualified rigs and operating personnel relative production costs availability and lead time requirements for drilling and production equipment the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect our customers’ drilling programs oil and natural gas prices are volatile which has historically led to significant fluctuations in expenditures by customers for drilling services variations in market conditions impact us in different ways depending primarily on the length of drilling contracts in different markets shortterm changes in these markets may have a minimal shortterm impact on revenues and cash flows unless the timing of contract renewals coincides with shortterm movements in the market offshore drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis or through privately negotiated transactions in determining which qualified drilling contractor is awarded a contract the key factors are pricing drillship availability drillship location condition and integrity of equipment their record of operating efficiency including high operating uptime technical specifications safety performance record crew experience reputation industry standing and customer relations competition for drillships is generally on a global basis as rigs are highly mobile however the cost associated with mobilizing drillships between regions is sometimes substantial as entering a new region could necessitate modifications of the drillship and its equipment to specific regional requirements we believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future we believe that opco’s initial fleet of recently constructed technologically advanced drillships provides it with a competitive advantage over competitors with older fleets as opco’s drillships are generally better suited to meet the requirements of customers for drilling in deepwater however certain competitors have greater financial resources than we do which may enable them to better withstand periods of low utilization and compete more effectively on the basis of price company description we are a growthoriented limited partnership recently formed by ocean rig to own operate and acquire offshore drilling units including through our ownership interest in opco opco’s initial fleet consists of three ultradeepwater drillships the ocean rig mylos the ocean rig skyros and the ocean rig athena all of which are currently in operation the drillships that comprise opco’s initial fleet are employed under multiyear contracts with affiliates of major oil companies including repsol total and conocophillips with an average remaining term of approximately  years as of august   we intend to grow our per unit distributions and our exposure to the offshore drilling market initially by acquiring additional interests in opco and at a later stage by acquiring ownership interests in other drilling units of our sponsor and third parties subject to certain limitations in our and our sponsor’s debt agreements we believe our sponsor will be motivated to facilitate our growth because of its significant ownership interest in us opco intends to leverage the relationships operating expertise and reputation of our sponsor to operate opco’s initial fleet in an efficient manner to recontract opco’s initial fleet under multiyear contracts and to identify opportunities to expand upon opco’s initial fleet through other acquisitions  we

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
