environmentmore why cantabcantab employs a multistrategy multiasset approach within the systematic space we aim to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns with low correlation to traditional investments in a technology driven environment“investors usually ask about the models cantab employs but the smarts the core of what we do is in the software”dr tom howatchief technology officer riskadjusted returns to us investment management equals risk management  cantab utilises sophisticated and robust proprietary risk management systems to generate attractive riskadjusted returns  multiple complementary and interlocking systems dynamically reallocate risk across the entire portfolio  we employ a rulesbased investment approach which enables us to tailor risk on demand and build portfolios that target a constant level of volatility meaningful diversification cantab’s philosophy is rooted in the idea that combining uncorrelated sources of return produces superior results over time  unlike many systematic investment managers who rely exclusively on trendfollowing strategies our institutionalstandard infrastructure has enabled us to build portfolios that adopt a multiasset multistrategy approach  we develop and implement investment and portfolio construction processes that aim to  deliver returns uncorrelated to longonly investments as well as to traditional hedge fund strategies scientific rigour  science is the ethos that permeates the whole of cantab  it drives our culture our scientists are at the heart of our business  based in cambridge in the uk close to the university and the city’s cluster of hightech companies our work resembles that of a scientific research organisation rather than a london city trading firm  our discipline and flat structure provide a platform for our scientists to research test and implement multiple systematic strategies  it allows us to be creative while applying science to finance  our research is based on the scientific method and is hypothesisdriven rather than datadriven we have an iconoclastic view of the world and approach investing like few others  we perform research and risk management as part of multiple teams across a nonhierarchical research environment that inspires scientists to work together across disciplines rather than in silos with industrial strength institutionalstandard infrastructure we believe we are a different type of manager and that our success rests on a collegial research environment which in turn allows our team to produce work of the highest quality   cantab cantab partners

to traditional investments in a technologydriven environmentmore why cantabcantab employs a multistrategy multiasset approach within the systematic space we aim to deliver attractive risk adjusted returns with low correlation to traditional investments in a technology driven environment“investors usually ask about the models cantab employs but the smarts the core of what we do is in the software”dr tom howatchief technology officer riskadjusted returns to us investment management equals risk management  cantab utilises sophisticated and robust proprietary risk management systems to generate attractive riskadjusted returns  multiple complementary and interlocking systems dynamically reallocate risk across the entire portfolio  we employ a rulesbased investment approach which enables us to tailor risk on demand and build portfolios that target a constant level of volatility meaningful diversification cantab’s philosophy is rooted in the idea that combining uncorrelated sources of return produces superior results over time  unlike many systematic investment managers who rely exclusively on trendfollowing strategies our institutionalstandard infrastructure has enabled us to build portfolios that adopt a multiasset multistrategy approach  we develop and implement investment and portfolio construction processes that aim to  deliver returns uncorrelated to longonly investments as well as to traditional hedge fund strategies scientific rigour  science is the ethos that permeates the whole of cantab  it drives our culture our scientists are at the heart of our business  based in cambridge in the uk close to the university and the city’s cluster of hightech companies our work resembles that of a scientific research organisation rather than a london city trading firm  our discipline and flat structure provide a platform for our scientists to research test and implement multiple systematic strategies  it allows us to be creative while applying science to finance  our research is based on the scientific method and is hypothesisdriven rather than datadriven we have an iconoclastic view of the world and approach investing like few others  we perform research and risk management as part of multiple teams across a nonhierarchical research environment that inspires scientists to work together across disciplines rather than in silos with industrial strength institutionalstandard infrastructure we believe we are a different type of manager and that our success rests on a collegial research environment which in turn allows our team to produce work
