whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or

subject to double taxation that is one tax at the corporate level on the corporations net income and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed s corporations have only one level of taxation all of their income is allocated to the shareholders however c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability in addition s corporations are subject to limitations such as the number and type of shareholders they can have legalzoom will help you start a c corporation or an s corporation get started by answering a few questions about your company and we will file your paperwork with the secretary of state how do i choose a corporate name in general the name of a corporation must end with incorporated corporation or an abbreviation of one of these a name will not be accepted if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name of another corporation already formed in that state many states also restrict the use of certain terms in a corporations name like bank police or insurance legalzoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names in order of preference we will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are available please note that for government purposes the names abc inc and abc corp are identical therefore you should disregard spaces periods and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name choices if the name of your corporation will be used in connection with goods or services you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark protection for the name this helps ensure that no one else in the us may use that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services except in areas where someone else is already using that name is a corporation required to have a registered agent each corporation must have a registered agent some states use the term resident agent or statutory agent but the concept is the same this is the person designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the corporation is served with a lawsuit most states require that the registered agent must be either  an adult living in the state of formation with a street address po boxes are not acceptable or  a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation that provides registered agent services one of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is that any officer or director of a corporation or manager or member of an llc can act as the registered agent however there are some advantages to having another person or company act as your registered agent first this adds an extra layer of privacy since the registered agents name and address are publicly available second this helps limit the risk that if your corporation or llc is named as a defendant in a lawsuit no one will surprise you at home on a sunday night with court papers how much will it cost to form and run a corporation each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation in many states you must also submit an annual report or list of directors and

know about forming a c corporation what is a c corporation a c corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax regulatory and official reasons a c corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business and contrasts with other popular business structures including limited liability companies llcs s corporations sole proprietorships and others generally a c corporation structure is better for larger businesses this is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares through having an initial public offering or ipo a c corporation is much more attractive to potential investors including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation the majority of larger businesses in the united states are structured as c corporations although a c corp could theoretically consist of just one person the information below will help you decide if a c corporation structure is right for your business how is a c corporation formed a c corp also known as a corporation is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level the corporation is formed by filing “articles of incorporation” with the secretary of state in the state of incorporation the policies articles cost and regulations for forming a c corp vary from statetostate details on exactly how to form a c corporation can be found at the end of this article the corporation is the oldest form of business entity it has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own although a c corp is a popular business structure there are other options for forming businesses in the us the advantages of c corporations forming a c corporation does have several benefits  a c corporation has limited liability because a c corp is a separate legal entity the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors investors and shareholders generally the owners of a c corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations this does not apply in all cases for example if corporate funds are misused there is wilful fraud or if certain rules and regulations are not followed  a c corporation exists independently of its owners a c corporation can have “perpetual existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business  ownership of c corporations can be fluid and transferred ownership in a c corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues these stocks can be bought and sold between investors and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company  ease of access to funding through issuing stock if a c corporation want to raise money it can hold an “initial public offering ipo” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange this can bring significant money into a business they can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding although this can dilute the value of existing shares  enhanced business or corporate credibility most of the businesses that are household names are c corporations incorporating as a c corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority the disadvantages of a c corporation a c corporation does have some disadvantages briefly they are a different tax structure to other types of businesses double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them legal rules regulations formalities and compliance they have to meet we cover these in more detail below what are the differences between an s corp c corp and llc two other popular business entity structures in the us are the s corp and the llc they provide many of the same protections offered by a c corp but have less formal rules on taxation governance and compliance this can mean more flexibility in how an llc or s corp is owned and funded one of the main differences between c corps and s corps  llcs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed for llcs and s corps any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’  shareholders’  members’ tax returns where it is taxed as part of their overall income the company does not have to file a separate tax return s corps and c corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends s corps are limited to having a maximum of  shareholders a c corp is taxed at the corporate level — that means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned how are profits and taxes handled with a c corp a c corporation is taxed as a separate business entity unlike individuals c corporations have to file a designated tax form with the irs which is called irs form  additionally c corporations have their own tax rates corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital this can shelter some of the profits from taxation c corporation tax rates the tax rates levied on c corporations are as follows profit up to  —     —     —     —     —     —     —  more than  —  stock dividends from c corporations a c corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends which are distributed to shareholders the percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice doubletaxed they are taxed first at the corporate level as profit on the corporation’s form  and again at the individual level as stock dividends on the shareholders form  what are a c corporations legal requirements a c corporation must meet certain requirements  hold an annual general meeting agm for the shareholders and the board of directors the annual meetings are

with team stsource message from the president when i was a boy my first job was riding my bicycle around to cut neighbors lawns pull weeds etc when i turned  and became more mobile i wanted to make more money working after school and on weekends my dad spoke to a friend that owned a local business and arranged for me to work at the very bottom of his totem pole without telling me of this prior arrangement he suggested that if i wanted a job i should apply at this company but first he gave me some advice that has been valuable during my long and varied career he said if you intend to show up on time work hard and do your best dont apply for a job with the attitude that they are going to do you a favor if your work is valuable it will help them make more money so you will be the one doing the favor not them this principal has served me well now as i depend on the members of our team to expand stsource so we can provide more quality cost effective products and services to our customers i remember my dad’s advice from another perspective we may make offers for quality talent to join team stsource but i can never forget that i am not the one doing the favor each member of our team is providing talent expertise and hard work that is propelling stsource to greater levels of success and providing higher value to our customers if the concept of joining stsource sparks your interest remember if you join our team i will always consider your work a personal favor about being a member of team stsource when stsource was founded in may of  we hired one employee his name was john webb

paths can develop within a company that is not bound by tradition and regulations if you become a member of stsource where you go will depend on the value you bring to the team and how the company

more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation

number of new legal matters  off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business

corporation state information about about us why choose us testimonials contact dashboard login incorporate now is a c corporation right for your business what you need to know about forming a c corporation what is a c corporation a c corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax regulatory and official reasons a c corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business and contrasts with other popular business structures including limited liability companies llcs s corporations sole proprietorships and others generally a c corporation structure is better for larger businesses this is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares through having an initial public offering or ipo a c corporation is much more attractive to potential investors including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation the majority of larger businesses in the united states are structured as c corporations although a c corp could theoretically consist of just one person the information below will help you decide if a c corporation structure is right for your business how is a c corporation formed a c corp also known as a corporation is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level the corporation is formed by filing “articles of incorporation” with the secretary of state in the state of incorporation the policies articles cost and regulations for forming a c corp vary from statetostate details on exactly how to form a c corporation can be found at the end of this article the corporation is the oldest form of business entity it has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own although a c corp is a popular business structure there are other options for forming businesses in the us the advantages of c corporations forming a c corporation does have several benefits  a c corporation has limited liability because a c corp is a separate legal entity the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors investors and shareholders generally the owners of a c corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations this does not apply in all cases for example if corporate funds are misused there is wilful fraud or if certain rules and regulations are not followed  a c corporation exists independently of its owners a c corporation can have “perpetual existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business  ownership of c corporations can be fluid and transferred ownership in a c corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues these stocks can be bought and sold between investors and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company  ease of access to funding through issuing stock if a c corporation want to raise money it can hold an “initial public offering ipo” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange this can bring significant money into a business they can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding although this can dilute the value of existing shares  enhanced business or corporate credibility most of the businesses that are household names are c corporations incorporating as a c corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority the disadvantages of a c corporation a c corporation does have some disadvantages briefly they are a different tax structure to other types of businesses double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them legal rules regulations formalities and compliance they have to meet we cover these in more detail below what are the differences between an s corp c corp and llc two other popular business entity structures in the us are the s corp and the llc they provide many of the same protections offered by a c corp but have less formal rules on taxation governance and compliance this can mean more flexibility in how an llc or s corp is owned and funded one of the main differences between c corps and s corps  llcs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed for llcs and s corps any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’  shareholders’  members’ tax returns where it is taxed as part of their overall income the company does not have to file a separate tax return s corps and c corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends s corps are limited to having a maximum of  shareholders a c corp is taxed at the corporate level — that means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned how are profits and taxes handled with a c corp a c corporation is taxed as a separate business entity unlike individuals c corporations have to file a designated tax form with the irs which is called irs form  additionally c corporations have their own tax rates corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital this can shelter some of the profits from taxation c corporation tax rates the tax rates levied on c corporations are as follows profit up to  —     —     —     —     —     —     —  more than  —  stock dividends from c corporations a c corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends which are distributed to shareholders the percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice doubletaxed they are taxed first at the corporate level as profit on the corporation’s form  and again at the individual level as stock dividends on the shareholders form  what are a c corporations legal requirements a c corporation must meet certain requirements  hold an annual general meeting agm for the shareholders and the board of directors the annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information strategic decisions opportunities risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with  issue shares to investors as ownership of the business ownership in a corporation

or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
