options share on linkedin share on pinterest share on google share on whatsapp share on messenger close lisa buckingham and frank kane friday  august   edt last modified on thursday  may   edt ratners jewellery chain has admitted for the first time that its business was decisively wounded when former chairman gerald ratner described one of its products as “total crap” mr ratner’s illjudged comments accelerated a spiral of decline for britain’s biggest jewellery group which plunged £m into the red in the year to february and is to close  shops in britain and the us the company which now intends to move more upmarket said the crash from profits a year earlier of £ million was largely caused by the impact of recession but a particularly poor performance from its strong ratners chain resulted from “adverse publicity” following gerald ratner’s infamous description of a decanter set sold by the group as “total crap” some time after those remarks which he claimed were taken out of context he resigned as chairman though he remains chief executive the slur contributing to a dire sales performance over christmas last year when the group’s sales slumped by  per cent at a time when jewellers traditionally expect to generate about  per cent of total revenues a similar performance this christmas could cast doubt on the group’s survival james mcadam who took over as executive chairman at the start of this year said mr ratner’s future with the company was not in doubt many shoppers who objected to the comment would have avoided ratners shops only to go into one of the group’s other stores the revamp of ratners’ business over the next three years following a refinancing package from its bankers will mean the closure of  of the group’s  shops in britain another  stores are to close in america with the probable loss of more than  jobs the reorganisation will cost the group almost £ million shares in ratners fell  p to   p valuing the group at just  million pounds in contrast to its  peak of £ million when mr ratner’s pileithigh sellitcheap approach to jewellery retailing seemed unconquerable mr mcadam was yesterday critical of this strategy which he said was inappropriate in difficult economic circumstances he plans to drive the chain upmarket placing more emphasis on customer service and making greater distinctions between the different outlets topics retail industry

the borough mr ratner an author whose new novel “in the land of the living” was released in march was raised in cleveland a son of a cousin of bruce ratner who masterminded the barclays center and brought the nets to brooklyn credit benjamin norman for the new york times the last name “ratner” usually conjures up one of two images among new yorkers there’s ratner’s the bygone jewish dairy and then there’s bruce ratner the developer of the atlantic yards in downtown brooklyn on whom opinion is notably more mixed one thing that doesn’t often come up however is literaturebut austin ratner  the most artsy member of the real estate clan is trying to change that “i know very little about the family business” he said over breakfast at maialino the other day “everything i do is in genuine pursuit of truth and beauty”mr ratner recently gave a reading for his latest novel “in the land of the living” at book court a bookstore in cobble hill brooklyn that drew a respectable crowd for a midlist author reading from his sophomore effort there were lots of ratners though no bruce some family friends and a few disaffected youth cadging free champagnemr ratner who combines the boyish handsomeness of clark kent with the nebbishness of woody allen stood at the rostrum his glasses were thick his hair neatly combed his book heavily annotated lay open in front of him advertisement continue reading the main story he is both a ratner and not a ratner eleven days shy of his third birthday his biological father a cleveland hematologist named norman gordon died of lymphoma at age  a few years later his mother married james ratner bruce ratner’s cousin and a cleveland real estate mogul and the boy was adopted continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story much of the autobiographical novel chronicles the pervading sense of loss “it’s very much drawn from my own personal experiences” he said like leo auberon the book’s protagonist mr ratner has spent his life trying both to live up to his father’s memory and almost but not quite realizing how quixotic the quest was like leo he grew up in the affluent cleveland neighborhood of shaker heights buried in books and shrouded in the sense of perpetual mourning familiar to any cleveland sports fan “losing is the only narrative we have” he saidand also like his character mr ratner was fixated on attending yale where his biological father had gone but refused to use his father’s name on the application “it was all about merit” he said chortling bitterly “as if yale was a meritocracy” mr ratner was rejected then strangely accepted and after attending for a year was overcome by feelings of inferiority and eventually transferred to the university of michigan it’s all chronicled in the book under the chapter “yalensis”he graduated from college in  and at the age of  earned a medical degree from the johns hopkins university school of medicine newsletter sign up continue reading the main

was left looking into a grave and i thought ‘i’m not going there’ ” he saidhe quit medicine and moved to new york city to become a fiction writer he moved into an apartment on the upper west side wrote health care copy for a dotcom by day and struggled to complete manuscripts by night he completed a first novel for which he couldn’t find a publisher and a medical school textbook “concepts in medical physiology” which sold rather well but it wasn’t the sort of writing he had in mindby this time mr ratner had a family of his own in  he had married kristin kubiak whom he had met at a wedding page  “the attractive one” and the couple had a son virgil born in though unburdened by financial exigencies he was saddled with the existential dread familiar to every struggling writer “i hit the absolute bottom of the ocean” he said “i was very depressed” he worked on a second novel applied to graduate school for creative writing and won a fellowship at the prestigious iowa writers’ workshopeventually his novel “the jump artist” a fictionalized account of the life of the photographer philippe halsman sold and won the sami rohr prize for jewish literature the prize was accompanied by a  purse and breathless press coverage harper’s called the book “a remarkable work” gq called it “elegantly written” soon mr ratner dropped out of the workshop and moved to brooklynbrooklyn broadly speaking is a borough where the brightest literary stars live in nice brownstones and write about dead parents see foer jonathan safran lethem jonathan auster paul so it’s not entirely surprising that mr ratner also lives in brooklyn in a  million brooklyn heights brownstone he bought in  or that he writes about not having a father that mr ratner’s manse is a product not of books but of bloodline is a bit of a touchy subject “of course the ratner family is the benefactor of my work” he said “but melville came from a wealthy family too some people consider him a pretty good writer” advertisement continue reading the main story after the reading mr ratner and his followers left the bookstore to head to the afterparty at a nearby restaurant in carroll gardens they turned their backs on the atlantic yards and walked toward what was presumably truth and beauty or at least a glass of wine continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us

dedicated to bringing whistleblower claimsthe federal false claims act and its state equivalents can be used to take action against private parties that cause the government to pay more for products or services than they are worth moreover these laws may be used to bring claims against entities that are heavily regulated by the us government especially pharmaceutical companies from his new york office whistleblower attorney james t ratner can guide plaintiffs nationwide through the process of bringing qui tam claims based on pharmaceutical fraud any type of misconduct that forces the government to incur financial losses may be an appropriate basis for legal actiondrug companies and the federal governmentpharmaceutical drug companies interact with the federal government primarily in the development and regulation of new and existing drugs any drug that a company seeks to put on the open market must first be approved by the food and drug administration this process can be lengthy and often limits companies to very particular uses for certain medications as a result it is prone to fraud and corruption by companies seeking to circumvent these strict requirementssome pharmaceutical companies also provide medications directly to the government in a more typical form of contractor relationship in particular medicare and medicaid offer specific drugs to patients through their prescription programs they set the availability and pricing for prescriptions on a federal level when pharmaceutical companies seek to have their medications included and priced competitively on medicare’s or medicaid’s drug lists fraudulent misrepresentations about the expense of such drugs may occurcombating fraud and financial misconduct in the pharmaceutical sectorbecause of the unique industry in which they work pharmaceutical companies are susceptible to particular types of fraud that can be exposed by whistleblowers one of the most common problems and the subject of several highprofile whistleblower lawsuits is the offmarket labeling of drugs by pharmaceutical companieswhen the fda approves a drug it may do so for a very limited purpose – known as the “onlabel” use pharmaceutical companies are subsequently limited to that particular purpose or medical condition when advertising their drugs physicians by contrast are able to prescribe such medications for “offuse” purposes including other conditions or diseases for which they believe the drug may be helpful in several significant cases including a  settlement with glaxosmithkline for three billion dollars pharmaceutical companies have been found to be marketing their medications for these offlabel purposes despite being prohibited from doing so this offlabel marketing is a form of fraud punishable under the false claims actofflabel marketing often occurs handinhand with another type of fraud perpetrated by pharmaceutical companies kickbacks these are payments made to doctors or hospitals in order to encourage medical providers to prescribe the pharmaceutical company’s drugs to their patients instead of directly providing cash to these parties pharmaceutical companies may offer lavish dinners trips nonmonetary gifts and payments for “advisory” or “consulting” services providing these types of incentives is illegal and can be pursued under both the antikickback statutes and the false claims actfinally pharmaceutical companies may also engage in the more common practice of attempting to deceive the government as to the price and value of the product it is receiving this is known as best price fraud in order to contract with medicare and medicaid pharmaceutical companies are required to provide their drugs at the best price available thus they are not allowed to have contracts with other private third parties for rates lower than what the government is being charged however in practice pharmaceutical companies may hide or disguise discounts being offered to others in order to keep medicare or medicaid prices higher than they should be thereby causing the government to pay more than it shouldconsult a knowledgeable qui tam attorney in new yorkthe

qui tam case is substantial financial loss to the governmentsince the government is frequently unaware of fraud against it the fca empowers private citizens to so alert it through the filing of qui tam lawsuits and receive a percentage of what the government recovers when a qui tam complaint is initiated it is filed under seal to allow an opportunity for the government to investigate if the
