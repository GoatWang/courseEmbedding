care possible matthew rabinowitz natera ceo and founder matthews bio read more about a personal story from our ceo why genetic testing impacting millions of lives every individual has a unique genome and we believe that comprehensive knowledge of this genetic makeup is becoming integral to the practice of medicine the ability to identify the presence of diseases early accurately and noninvasively has the potential to impact the lives of millions of patients and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs the rapid expansion of nextgeneration dna sequencing has unlocked a wealth of information about the role of genomics in disease and is enabling a new class of tests that improve patient care particularly in prenatal care and oncology as the scientific and medical community’s understanding of genetic disease accelerates natera believes technologies that enable precise and efficient measurement of mutated fragments of dna are well positioned to translate this information

commercialization of genetic testing services the company operates a laboratory certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments clia providing a host of preconception and prenatal genetic testing servicesthe companys product offerings include its panorama noninvasive prenatal test nipt that screens for chromosomal abnormalities of a fetus with a blood draw from the mother horizon carrier screening horizon to determine carrier status for a large number of severe genetic diseases that could be passed on to the carriers children spectrum preimplantation genetic screening pgs and spectrum preimplantation genetic diagnosis pgd to analyze chromosomal anomalies or inherited genetic conditions during an in vitro fertilization ivf cycle to select embryos with the probability of becoming healthy children anora products of conception poc test to analyze fetal chromosomes to understand the cause of miscarriage and noninvasive paternity testing pat to determine paternity by analyzing the fragments of fetal deoxyribonucleic acid dna in a pregnant mothers blood and a blood sample from the alleged fathers all testing is available principally in the united states and europe the company also offers constellation a cloudbased software product that involves analysis of copy number variations cnvs and single nucleotide variants snvs in a dna mixture it allows laboratory customers to gain access through the cloud to the companys algorithms and bioinformatics in order to validate and launch tests based on the companys technologythe companys technologies allow achieving a high signal to noise ratio when detecting fragments of dna from samples as small as a single cell which allows it to deliver screening tests with differentiated specificity sensitivity and coverage the companys commercial tests assess the risk of a range of conditions from a single blood draw including common fetal aneuploidies microdeletions triploidy and inherited genetic conditions that could be passed on from parent to child the company sells its tests directly and partners with other clinical laboratories to distribute its tests globally all of its products other than its constellation cloud software product are laboratory developed tests ldts its multiplexed polymerase chain reaction mmpcr technology optimizes the behavior of primers in a reaction to generate a highresolution measurement of thousands of dna loci in patient samples as a result it can capture mutations from a single dna fragment within a large background of extraneous dna found in a patients blood sample the company uses statistical techniques to combine the measurements of its molecular assays with its internal databases and the sources of publicly available genomic information to build detailed models of the genome of interest this process includes the use of a statistical technique known as maximum likelihood estimation mle which is used in other industries such as in the conversion of a noisy transmitted analog communications signal to a digital format panorama helps physicians assess fetal genetic abnormalities by noninvasive screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities including down syndrome edwards syndrome patau syndrome turner syndrome and triploidy which result in intellectual disability severe organ abnormalities and death of the fetus panorama can also identify fetal sex panorama is performed on a maternal blood sample and can be performed as early as nine weeks into a pregnancy panorama starts with a simple blood draw from the mother either in a doctors office in a laboratory or through a phlebotomist that may travel to the patientthe company extracts dna from each sample amplifies the specific single nucleotide polymorphisms snps that it is interested in measuring and then sequences the dna using nextgeneration sequencing ngs using its bioinformatics technology the company analyzes the dna sequences to assess the state of the fetal genome focusing on the snp data while incorporating public information from the human genome project its bioinformatics algorithm builds billions of detailed models of the genetic state of the sample to determine the diagnosis after panorama generates its result it provides the doctor or the laboratory with a report showing the risk that abnormalities are present in the fetus its panorama microdeletions panel screens for five of the common genetic diseases caused by microdeletions q deletion syndrome di george syndrome p deletion angelman syndrome criduchat syndrome and praderwilli syndromethe companys pgs test screens embryos for chromosomal abnormalities prior to transfer of embryos created through ivf procedures which have nonviable chromosomal abnormalities this allows ivf physicians to select and transfer embryos with normal chromosome results and combines it with single embryo transfer its pgd test screens embryos for couples who are concerned about passing on a specific genetic defect to their child anora is its poc product which tests miscarriage tissue in women who have experienced one or more miscarriages to determine whether there was an underlying genetic reason for the miscarriages its noninvasive prenatal paternity product allows a couple to establish paternity without waiting for the child to be bornthe company

and regenerative medicine applications natera aspires to build a different type of national cord blood company by combining bestinclass cord blood cryopreservation with the companys ability to provide timely information about genetic disease risk potentially expanding families stem cell treatment options in the future   natera will offer evercord through its leading direct sales channel in the united states the market potential of cord blood stem cells newborn stem cells sourced from umbilical cord blood are known to contain hematopoietic stem cells hscs that can potentially differentiate and regenerate healthy blood and immune systems unfortunately out of the roughly four million births each year in the united states more than  of the cord blood from those births is currently discarded as waste highlighting a significant opportunity both for families who could benefit from cord blood and for natera as it enters the cord blood and tissue banking market published data also suggests that one in three people in the united states or  million people could potentially benefit from regenerative medicine applications which if proven effective expands the possible therapeutic use of cord blood stem cells more than  studies are currently underway including clinical trials focused on current and new cord blood stem cell therapies in regenerative medicine  these trials hold promise for a growing list of conditions including alzheimers disease cerebral palsy diabetes type iii spinal cord injury cartilage and bone repair and heart defects more than  cord blood stem cell treatments have been conducted worldwide and nateras prenatal tests including its carrier test horizon™ currently screen for  of the nearly  diseases where cord blood stem cell treatment has been
