to eviscerate the notion of ownership sure we pay for their vehicles but we don’t own them not according to their corporate lawyers anywayin a particularly spectacular display of corporate delusion john deere—the worlds largest agricultural machinery maker —told the copyright office that farmers don’t own their tractors because computer code snakes through the dna of modern tractors farmers receive “an implied license for the life of the vehicle to operate the vehicle”it’s john deere’s tractor folks you’re just driving itseveral manufacturers recently submitted similar comments to the copyright office under an inquiry into the digital millennium copyright act dmca is a vast  copyright law that among other things governs the blurry line between software and hardware the copyright office after reading the comments and holding a hearing will decide in july which hightech devices we can modify hack and repair—and decide whether john deere’s twisted vision of ownership will become a realitywired opinionaboutkyle wiens is the cofounder and ceo of ifixit an online repair community and parts retailer internationally renowned for their open source repair manuals and product teardownsover the last two decades manufacturers have used the dmca to argue that consumers do not own the software underpinning the products they buy—things like smartphones computers coffeemakers cars and yes even tractors so old macdonald has a tractor but he owns a massive barn ornament because the manufacturer holds the rights to the programming that makes it runthis is an important issue for farmers a neighbor kerry adams hasn’t been able to fix an expensive transplanter because he doesn’t have access to the diagnostic software he needs hes not alone many farmers are opting for older computerfree equipmentover the last two decades manufacturers have used the dmca to argue that consumers do not own the software that powers the products they buyin recent years some companies have even leveraged the dmca to stop owners from modifying the programming on those products this means you can’t strip drm off smart kitty litter boxes install custom software on your ipad or alter the calibration on a tractor’s engine not without potentially running afoul of the dmcawhat does any of that have to do with copyright owners tinkerers and homebrew “hackers” must copy programming so they can modify it product makers don’t like people messing with their stuff so some manufacturers place digital locks over software breaking the lock making the copy and changing something could be construed as a violation of copyright lawand that’s how manufacturers turn tinkerers into “pirates”—even if said “pirates” aren’t circulating illegal copies of anything makes sense right yeah not to me eitherit makes sense to john deere the company argues that allowing people to alter the software—even for the purpose of repair—would “make it possible for pirates thirdparty developers and less innovative competitors to freeride off the creativity unique expression and ingenuity of vehicle software” the pièce de résistance in john deere’s argument permitting owners to root around in a tractor’s programming might lead to pirating music through a vehicle’s entertainment system because copyrightmarauding farmers are very busy and need to multitask by simultaneously copying taylor swifts  and harvesting corn i’m guessing because john deere’s lawyers never explained why anyone would pirate music on a tractor only that it could happenjohn deere is a company by the way that is seriously serious about preventing people from copying their stuff so serious in fact that they even locked the pdf they sent to the copyright office no modifying the document and no copying passages really john deere how am i supposed to highlight all thats wrong in this document nowjohn deere is a company by the way that is seriously serious about preventing people from copying their stuff so serious in fact that they even locked the pdf they sent to the copyright office no modifying the document and no copying passages really john deere how am i supposed to highlight all thats wrong in this document now screenshot by kyle wiensjohn deere may be out of touch but its not alone other corporations including trade groups representing nearly every major automaker made the same case to the copyright office again and again its worth noting tesla motors didnt join automakers in this argument even though its cars rely heavily on proprietary softwaregeneral motors told the copyright office that proponents of copyright reform mistakenly “conflate ownership of a vehicle with ownership of the underlying computer software in a vehicle” but i’d bet most americans make the same conflation—and joe sixpack might be surprised to learn gm owns a giant chunk of the chevy sitting in his drivewayother automakers pointed out that owners who make unsanctioned modifications could alter their vehicles in bad ways they could tweak them to go faster or change engine parameters to run afoul of emissions regulationsjoe sixpack might be surprised to learn gm owns a giant chunk of the chevy sitting in his drivewaythey’re right that could happen but those activities are  already illegal and  have nothing to do with copyright if youre going too fast a cop should stop you—copyright law shouldnt if youre dodging emissions regulations you should pay epa fines—not dmca fines and the specter of someone doing something illegal shouldnt justify shutting down all the reasonable and legal modifications people can make to the things they paid forgm went so far as to argue locking people out helps innovation thats like saying locking up books will inspire kids to be innovative writers because they won’t be tempted to copy passages from a hemingway novel meanwhile outside of bizarroland actual technology experts—including the electronic frontier foundation—have consistently labeled the dmca an innovation killer they insist that rather than stopping content pirates language in the dmca has been used to stifle competition and expand corporate control over the life and afterlife of productsthe bad part is my sense is these companies are just locking up this technology and increasing the sort of monopoly pricing structure that just doesnt work for us” brian talley a farmer on california’s central coast says of restrictions placed on his equipment i toured his farm with a fellow from the intellectual property  technology law clinic so we could tell the copyright office how manufacturers are hampering farmers “we are used to operating independently and thats one of the great things about being a farmer and in this particular space they are really taking that away from usthe notion of actually owning the things you buy has become revolutionarythe electronic frontier foundation the intellectual property  technology law clinic and the digital right to repair coalition disclaimer i’m a founding member of the coalition are fighting to preserve the notion of ownership we’re trying to open the floodgates of information to let owners investigate the code in their devices to modify them for better functionality to repair them even without the blessing of manufacturerthankfully we aren’t alone there’s a backlash against the slow creep of corporate product controlearlier this year consumers sent  comments to the copyright office—all of them urging the restoration of ownership rights the year before consumers and activists forced a law through congress that made it legal to unlock a cellphone and move it to a different carrierthis week senator ron wyden and representative jared polis will introduce the “breaking down barriers to innovation act of  which would substantially improve the dmca process lawmakers in minnesota and new york have introduced “fair repair” legislation that assert an owners right to repair electronic equipment theyve purchased they want equal access to repair information replacement parts and security updatesof course taking back the stuff that we own wont be easy corporations have better lobbyists than the rest of us and somehow the notion of actually owning the things you buy has become revolutionaryit doesn’t have to be tell the copyright office to side with consumers when it decides which gadgets are legal to modify and repair urge lawmakers to support legislation like the unlocking technology act and the your own devices act because we deserve the keys to our own products and support fair repair legislationif you bought it you should own it—simple as that it’s time corporate lawyers left the bullshit to the farmers who actually need itcarscopyrightdmcafarminghardwareprogrammingsoftwaremost
