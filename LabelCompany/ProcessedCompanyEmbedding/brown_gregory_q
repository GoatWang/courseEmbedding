thanks shep good morning and thanks for joining us today id like to make a few opening comments about the first quarter and the business overall before gino takes us through the results and the outlook first q was a solid quarter for us revenue was flat although when adjusting for currency the business grew  with growth in all regions except latin america additionally we posted doubledigit profitability growth with a  increase in nongaap operating earnings and a  increase in nongaap earnings per share second im very pleased with another excellent quarter of growth in north america which grew  on strong product sales overall our business continues to show signs of improvement including our backlog position at the end of the quarter which grew  and third we continue to drive future growth through important investments in innovation and were driving an increasinglyefficient cost base that positions us well for improved leverage and stronger cash generation ill now turn the call over to gino to provide additional details on q results and our outlook gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president thank you greg good morning everyone first quarter revenue was  billion flat versus q of  up  in constant currency additionally ending backlog was up  million or  versus last year and up  versus q inclusive of a  million unfavorable fx adjustment to backlog in q gaap operating earnings were  million nongaap operating earnings were  million or  of sales a  basis point improvement from the year ago quarter gaap eps from continuing operations was  per share compared to  in the first quarter of  nongaap eps grew  yearoveryear primarily driven by our costsavings initiatives for the remainder of the call we will reference nongaap financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted turning to the product segment q sales were  million up  versus the prior year and up  in constantcurrency terms growth was driven by strong demand in north america for our p and pcr product lines q product segment operating income was  million up  million to  of sales versus the prioryear quarter driven by our costreduction actions product segment backlog ended the quarter at  billion up  million versus last year and up  million sequentially reflecting the fourth consecutive quarter of increase the yearoveryear increase was driven primarily by asia pac and the middle east while we also saw an increase in north america as expected we saw a decrease in europe related to the continuing deployment of the norway system turning to services q services revenue was  million down  as expected iden and integration services declined while key growth areas of managed services and lifecycle support services were slightly up compared to last year excluding both iden and the impact of fx our services business grew  services operating income was  million down  million to  of revenue driven primarily by lower iden sales and a lower gross margin in integration services as we stated in our q call we expect lower service gross margin in the first half of  we continue to expect a return to the mid gross margin range for the second half of the year services backlog is  billion up  million or  versus last year and flat sequentially despite a  million foreign exchange adjustment in q moving to operating expenses total company operating expenses from continuing operations were  million down  million or  from the year ago quarter driven primarily by continued cost reduction activities as well as some benefit due to pension expense and a stronger dollar our largest decline came in ga while we also drove reductions in sales and marketing and rd as of the end of q we are on a run rate to deliver savings of  million to   million versus  we are well positioned to deliver solid operating leverage as we move throughout the year other income and expense in q was  million compared to  million in the year ago quarter our q effective tax rate was  we continue to expect full year  effective tax rate to be approximately  we also continue to expect our cash tax rate to remain at approximately  through  turning to cash flow cash flow from operations in the first quarter was  million an increase of  million yearoveryear the improvement in cash generation was driven primarily by working capital improvements specifically accounts receivable we ended q in a net debt position of  million in q we repurchased  million of stock at an average price of  while paying out  million in dividends now turning to our outlook we expect total company sales for q to decline  to  which includes approximately  million in yearoveryear currency impact this outlook also includes approximately  million in headwinds in the second quarter related to the temporary delay of the larics public safety lte deployment we expect nongaap eps between  and  factoring in q results our first half expectations remain unchanged moving to the full year our revenue outlook remains unchanged we continue to expect full year  sales to be flat to down  which translates to  to  growth in constant currency terms we now expect full year nongaap eps of  to  a share ill now turn it back to greg gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer thanks gino im encouraged by our q results north america was a particular bright spot which grew  on strong product sales north america has posted two consecutive strong quarters of growth and we believe the region will return to growth for the full year backlog is up in this region over  million on a yearoveryear basis moving to the other regions the europe and africa region declined  in q due to currency adjusting for currency the region posted  growth asia pac saw a  sales decline in q or flat excluding currency order activity here has been healthy and aged backlog in asia pac is higher than the second half of last year our middle east business while smaller is growing quickly with a large rise in backlog both yearoveryear and sequentially as the large public safety lte win we mentioned last quarter added over  million to the backlog position latin america had a challenging quarter due to a strong prior year compare along with a significant decline in iden as expected additionally theres also a number of countries there that are facing difficult macroeconomic conditions which is tempering our expectations in the region for the full year turning to segment highlights and initiatives in our product segment were making progress across and against our growth initiatives of driving system upgrades software enablement monetizing product enhancements and new product introductions in the quarter we earned new business from customers upgrading aged systems and purchasing additional software features and functionality we also delivered more core innovation within our product portfolio with a specific customerdriven solution such as the apx a p portable radio featuring integrated wifi and quad band radio all in one device the wifi capability enables more efficient radio management for our customers with a faster broadband connection for software feature and firmware updates additionally this breakthrough technology enables four radio bands in one device and allows our public safety customers to communicate across borders and between systems using a single device that further improves interoperability from an rd perspective the apx incorporates our newest platform development approach that will be fully leveraged on future models in order to minimize cost and drive simplification another portfolio enhancement this quarter includes tetra radio innovations specific to mission critical demands our new devices have improved ruggedness coverage audio and enhanced security features that better serve the specific needs of our public safety customers in addition to new and improved device innovation our north america p infrastructure now incorporates wave technology which enables the convergence of lmr and lte access from any device via an ip connection our customers are responding to these growth drivers through strategic wins such as the norway project utilizing wave technology to enable secure approved users the ability to monitor and utilize specific talk groups while outside the country or network the  million south australia network thats a major upgrade of an existing system with new features and functionality the  million win with hamilton county ohio thats an upgrade of their existing system with integrated voice and data capabilities that not only improves their network today but enables continuous upgrades to new features and functionality via software updates going forward our services segment revenue was down slightly this quarter due to currency pressure iden and integration services declines however we posted increases in the areas of lifecycle support services managed services and smart public safety solutions lifecycle wins include a  million award with hamilton county ohio for a multiyear hardware and software maintenance agreement on top of the  million hardware and system upgrade it also includes a multiyear hardware and software agreement with the city of columbus georgia for  million plus  million for a multiyear premierone cad maintenance agreement both of these support agreements are on top off a  million order for conventional equipment our managed services business earned several notable wins including  million for a multiyear managed services contract that was a part of the south australia government radio network deal and we also won multiyear managed services deals worth  million in brazil and  million in iraq finally our smart public safety solutions business was bolstered with the acquisitions of emergency callworks and publicengines both companies are leading providers of softwarebased solutions solidifying our offerings in command and control and next generation  call centers and intelligenceled policing solutions key wins include a  million command and control contract with a country in africa  million to expand the city of chicagos video surveillance system and several cad and nextgeneration  wins leveraging our new emergency callworks portfolio so let me close with a few thoughts first q was a solid start to the year in terms of sales momentum and ending backlog position we performed particularly well in both north america and the middle east second we continue to make excellent progress driving further operational efficiencies while also improving speed and execution we feel confident about delivering on our cost targets and will keep applying the proper rigor to size the business appropriately for the long term and finally we continue to aggressively return capital to shareholders we bought back  million of stock and paid  million of dividends in q weve returned over  billion to shareholders just in the past two quarters alone and weve now moved into a net debt position and that said we remain focused on further improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and ill now turn it back over to shep shep dunlap  vice presidentinvestor relations thanks greg before we begin taking questions i would like to remind callers to limit themselves to one question and a followup so we can accommodate as many people as possible operator would you please remind our callers on the line how to ask a question questionandanswer session operator thank you and we can take our first question from tim long with bmo capital please go ahead tim long  bmo capital markets united states thank you two questions for me first on the revenue side obviously backlog looks strong two quarters in a row here even exing out the currency it looks like the second half implies pretty flat yearoveryear so just wondering why thats not a little bit stronger is there something in the aging of the backlog or something that maybe makes us feel better about heading into next year and then secondly on the gross margin side i get in the quarter that services was a little bit of a drag just curious on the product side that was down a little bit as well just curious are there any measures you can take to match the strong performance youre having on the opex side and maybe get some more efficiencies out of the gross margin line on products thank you gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president good morning tim this is gino ill start with the gross margin question specifically in product the impact of currency is really what were seeing from a product gross margin perspective its about  basis points on gross margin actually its a bit larger than that offset by strong north america product sales and we continue to explore and work different options to minimize certainly the impact of fx as weve done in opex with respect to the backlog position nothings really changed in the aging it is a little bit different expectation of the inyear orders versus backlog orders for the remainder of the year but there is no change in aging – any appreciable change in the aging of backlog tim long  bmo capital markets united states okay thank you operator and our next question will come from ehud gelblum with citi please go ahead your line is open ehud a gelblum  citigroup global markets inc broker thanks guys appreciate it very strong stable results a couple questions first of all at what point do you expect to lap norway and xnorway is europe stable or still declining and is it – once we get past – i assume by the end of this year well certainly be past the initial decline in norway does europe start growing and then one of your competitors harris obviously is having some issues a lot of that is share gains by you guys im assuming most of that is north america is there any way you can parse out how much of the strength you see in north america is share gains from harris versus how much is underlying market growth and then lastly a comment on lte obviously lte has had a rough quarter both at larics and at firstnet what are your thoughts we saw the guidance the  million in headwinds from la in q but what are your thoughts on the  million for this year and for next year and just kind of just walk us through the – your longterm thoughts on lte what are the different directions that can go in both kind of in a normal bull case but also in a bear case what could happen if lte and firstnet really doesnt get off the ground what does that scenario look like for the next couple of years then for your business thanks gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer so hudy a couple of things lets start with – ill start with harris yes i think clearly that the  growth in q led by jack molloy and his team as well as the  in q really strong performance now we dont expect north america to grow for the full year at those levels but that said theres no question we are taking market share from them i dont know the exact bifurcation of share gain versus overall market lift what i would say is though as per my previous comments i thought that narrow banding would largely be behind us by the first half of this year i would say that thats still true given not only the north america growth performance but the device performance specifically within north america thats first second lte despite the larics delay and the  million headwind in q and the down scoping of that project for the full year i remind you that we have three projects large ones that generate probably  plus of the lte revenue even with the headwinds in la and were pleased that that suspensions been lifted were looking forward to completing a successful system we still believe hudy we can do approximately  million in public safety lte revenue this year because theres other puts and takes from the other projects and in the main we still feel pretty good about the full year and our earlier projections last in terms of lte were focused on completing the awards that have been made as we mentioned at the financial analyst meeting were still engaged with some customers in the middle east customers in latin america customers in asia pac and we will continue to pace here in the us to the pace of firstnet the draft rfp is out its still unclear what final configuration or business model will result in firstnet but we continue to work closely with them and wed certainly have a number of options that were planning for contingent upon how ultimately public safety lte gets rolled out in the us so i think were well prepared from a variety of different options standpoint and were still in a good position and by the way with the investments we made we have the best portfolio and i believe at least a twoyear head start versus our competitors mark moon  executive vice president  presidentsales and product operations just to tag on to that and then ill speak to your question about norway hudy the other thing to point out on those three large deployments that greg mentioned quite honestly even the smaller trials that weve got going theyre primarily infrastructure today so when you think about future growth you also got to think about theyre clearly going to add devices applications additional services so thats also why it was important for larics although descoped to get back started so that we can demonstrate the capabilities and that will lead to some future growth of those kinds of items as we move forward on norway clearly the biggest burnoff if you will of the norway revenue will happen in the second half as we indicated earlier then well see more of a reasonable trend obviously that will put pressure on ea even for next year because weve had a strong first half in norway this year with that being said though just like this first quarter we had growth in constant currency terms so ea still continues to perform strong we are eating out of backlog as we expected to be but really because of norway were still working on a number of large deals our funnel and customer activity is still pretty healthy so i do see as we go into  and beyond we will backfill behind norway and begin to move back towards growth ehud a gelblum  citigroup global markets inc broker thats very helpful i appreciate that thanks gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer thanks hudy shep dunlap  vice presidentinvestor relations next question operator and our next question comes from pierre ferragu with bernstein please go ahead pierre c ferragu  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey thank you very much for taking my question id actually like to talk a bit more about lte because i get the feeling there has been a bit of confusion especially in the last  hours in the investment community about how lte spending and the rampup of lte could affect lmr spending on – in your client base so i think it would be very useful to have your perspective on how lte gets integrated with lmr and if there is a risk of lte at some point replacing lmr infrastructure and if a rampup in spending in lte could hurt spending in lmr so your perspective on that point would be very very helpful i think gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer so pierre we – just to be clear we absolutely view public safety lte as additive not substitutional to lmr first and foremost our view is unchanged from that perspective i mean i can only tell you what customers are telling us and what theyre doing both domestically and internationally and they continue to buy lmr by the way north america being a great example referenced  in q  in q the middle east is another good example and in the three large projects of public safety lte they are all either have bought or are in the process of buying brand new lmr systems with multiyear services contract as well so look i know theres a lot of noise about this but at the end of the day i feel very good about our position and investments in technology and specifically pierre mission critical voice and mission critical data communications customers are buying both lmr and public safety lte backlog are at the highest levels i can remember and remember that includes multiyear services showing the staying power and longevity of our solutions and our platforms so i know theres a lot of noise and misinformation i just dont see it i see lmr and our core platforms having a long installed life and i see public safety lte as being additive and eventually interoperable so you have broadband data interoperable with narrow band voice many countries in europe continue to buy countrywide tetra systems some of those are also looking at lte solutions so i look at it as an overlay and when you look at the work done in the standards community and people use labels like mission critical but theres mission critical voice and then theres mission critical voice for public safety and you get into a whole host of different attributes in the first layer of the gpp standards the second layer of the gpp standards and then the actual network deployment components that are necessary for power generation and redundancy and the devicedevice communications in case the site goes down i think its a space we know well and i think we know both lmr and lte well we absolutely view them as additive and we view them as contributing to a very solid growth story for us going forward pierre c ferragu  sanford c bernstein  co llc thanks thats very useful clarification and i think its a very important message to clarify as you say the noise we heard recently on that thanks for that gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer thanks pierre operator and well take our next question from rod hall with jpmorgan please go ahead rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc yeah hi guys thanks for the question and good earnings so i wanted to dig a little bit more into the services line well i guess from a couple of angles but its really the same question which is you guys are talking about the gross margin improving in the second half i assume that thats because the mix of installation services is reducing but i just wanted to ask you guys if you could give us any indication what the proportion of maintenance services – or im sorry of installation services in the current services line is so we can kind of think about how that gross margin might progress and then the same thing from a different angle im looking at your backlog and the last two quarters this big jump in services backlog i wonder do you expect that backlog in services to wind down in the second half or can you just talk about how that backlog is built up and how you expect it to move in the second half of the year thanks gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure rod this is gino well start with services so the – as we talked about in the last call services gross margin we expect to be pressured in the first half returning to normal growth rates in the second half and its really a mix within integration services not to integration services the projects that are deploying in the first half of the year and the question on how much of our services number is integration services about   rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc okay and gino do you expect – what do you think that proportion will be in the second half gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think the proportion will be very similar it will be within that  to  range again its the mix within integration services not to integration services rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and then on the backlog for the services backlog what do you think that is going to look like as we move to the second half of the year gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president we dont outlook backlog but i will say that the backlog services backlog does include a large number of multiyear service agreements so i would not expect that backlog to be peeling off in the second half of the year substantially rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc do you think – or should we expect the growth to continue or do you think it more or less kind of remains stable through the year gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president im not going to comment on outlooking that backlog but i will say there – you should not expect any major movement in the services backlog down in the second half of the year rod b hall  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks a lot gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer and just rod one other just question about overall backlog from an aging standpoint total backlog now this is both product and services its slightly better than last year its about  million at this point better than last year for aged backlog for the remainder of  all in operator and we can take our next question from tavis mccourt with raymond james please go ahead tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc hey guys thanks for taking my question gino a couple of quick guidance questions to dig into gross margin again last year i think gross margin kind of ticked up sequentially each quarter pretty steadily is that the pattern you would expect from just a lower base in q or is there kind of a specific quarter that there would be a bigger uplift and then on operating cost can you kind of repeat what the opex guidance is for the year is it  million to  million decline nongaap versus nongaap  or i think there was a mention of a run rate number i just want to make sure i was clear on what that opex guidance was gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president sure so ill start with the gross margin question tavis gross margin its really first half to second half although we do expect to see a slight improvement in the second quarter over the first quarter but its largely a first half to second half improvement with respect to operating expenses the guidance is down  million to  million versus  full year the run rate comment was meant to articulate that we are currently at the run rate exiting q we are on that run rate to deliver savings of  million to  million tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc got it and then kind of a bigger picture question for you greg you made an acquisition or two in the quarter some venture capital investments and i guess give us a sense of how broad you would like the solution set over the next couple of years and how you get there from kind of primarily a radio business to something that might be kind of a fuller solution set selling into your core customers gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer i think that from an acquisition standpoint they – the general philosophy would be that they would be in line with the core business of what we do primarily i think as you dimensionalized where we are today as a pure play i think potentially things around the managed services area or the smart public safety area might afford themselves to round out our portfolio because were building the endtoend infrastructure and device solution we have it on narrow band lmr we also have it on a broadband public safety lte so things that would extend from a situational awareness standpoint to potentially the command and control room and analytics that would allow the movement of content around software and services so in general from a macro standpoint id say software and managed services would seem to be appealing to us we feel very good about the core radio position and the enhancement of the technology portfolio on that side but well continue to be very surgical in what we do tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc and when we hear about a lot of demand for body cameras right now is that something that you guys benefit from at all from a retail relationship or is that generally a different purchase order from the purchase monitors gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer so we do have a product around body cameras that were in the market with today i think that the whole push on situational awareness and the heightened awareness around video is a net positive beyond body cameras by the way i think theres other ways that we would be able to and could potentially capture video aside from just an auxiliary camera but i think we believe the real value there is in the processing of video the dissemination and aggregation of it the analytics of it the sharing of it because its a ton of information thats going to be piling into these command centers and with first responders at the site how do you move it between the two how do you extract it how do you provide decision support how do you do evidence tagging so i think were burning more cycles we have hardware solutions and well continue to do that but we think the real value of body worn video or this preponderance and importance of video is in the software movement and analytics of it tavis c mccourt  raymond james  associates inc great thanks very much operator well take our next question from simona jankowski with goldman sachs please go ahead simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co hi thanks very much i wanted to follow up on your comment on the north america improvement can you just expand a little bit on the visibility you have into that in particular your aged backlog for this year as it pertains to that and then i think you referenced the mix of devices versus the infrastructure in the quarter can you just comment on how that compares to what youve seen in recent quarters mark moon  executive vice president  presidentsales and product operations so simona this is mark moon so when we think about north america greg talked about we were pleased with q and q by the way coming out of that our backlog position is better a big piece of that backlog position improvement is in multiyear services which is also good for future upgrades in what we do but our product backlog is also up and the backlog aged in the year is actually stronger than it was at this point last year so were seeing the improvement that we thought we would see in north america when you look at north america in general overall state and local spend and revenues are up it spend is up federal seems to be returning to a little bit more normal predictability for us we were up slightly last year as i talked to you about in the last call while we were down slightly in first quarter we still have got some good orders and were building backlog and we think well have modest growth for the full year so we have good visibility good activity throughout north america i mean we are encouraged by the activity were seeing from customers in north america simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co and on the mix of devices and infrastructure gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer i think in q the growth primarily was devicedriven which i think reflects our commentary around narrow banding as purchasing kind of returns to more normalized states simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co okay thats helpful and then just lastly for an update on the capital structure do you see any additional capacity now to add debt from here gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer well from a capital structure standpoint what id say is obviously weve been very aggressive in returning capital weve returned  billion over the last  months almost all of the proceeds from the zebra transaction have been returned to shareholders we did  billion just in the last two quarters i like the fact that the share base has contracted  in just over three years so i think weve been good stewards of capital and we purchased  million back at andchange at todays levels we absolutely see the stock is even more attractive today so i think therell be opportunities for us to pursue that moving forward and were in a net debt position and we said we would move to that position were pleased that coming out of q were in it so i think our balance sheet has a lot of flexibility that affords us options moving forward simona k jankowski  goldman sachs  co great thank you operator well take our next question from paul silverstein with cowen  company please go head unknown speaker hi this is fahad  in for paul i had a couple of questions one on your opex for the year are there any benefits from the fx headwinds that youve indicated on your revenue line is the opex side being driven positively by the fx gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer so we did – just to remind you we did  million – over  million of expense reduction last year and were run rating to  million to  million this year while we clearly have a benefit from fx the overwhelming majority of those reductions are nonfx id say  roughly are reductions  is being the beneficiary of fx were getting after the cost and with the opportunity as a pure play company were restructuring reconfiguring eliminating bureaucracies and redundancies and duplications and footprint and im really proud of the team and well continue to move forward on that unknown speaker all right and then secondly regarding this st louis police department win it seems you indicated realtime intelligence solution that you sold can you elaborate more on these nextgen growth driver businesses that youre involved in how does that pipeline for those kind of projects look for you bob schassler  executive vice presidentsolutions  services yeah this is bob schassler we implemented our real time crime center in st louis which as weve talked about in the past its about a  billion sam for us and weve got probably about  new deals that weve actually signed in the first quarter and the reception by customers really continues to be positive as greg talked a little bit about the video analytics body worn cameras is really part of that overall solution unknown speaker so in terms of like sales from video analytics and if im not mistaken you also provide some storage solutions as well or is that bob schassler  executive vice presidentsolutions  services thats right its really our overall smart public safety solutions so storage video analytics our publicengines acquisition is part of that data analytics as well gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer i think its fair to say obviously thats relatively small today whats important though is customers many would like to do business with one provider so while theres a variety of different products to the extent we if we have the land mobile radio system and we can extend the relationship the sales resources the technical people into the command center and do in hardware andor software and potentially storage its a logical extension of what we do that i think generally will help our growth profile bob schassler  executive vice presidentsolutions  services the only other comment id have is that these are really softwarebased solutions recurring revenue models so they go on for five years to ten years and its really part of our overall public safety lte solution combined with our smart public safety solutions as weve said are very complementary to one another unknown speaker got it thank you so much operator and our next question comes from keith housum with northcoast research please go ahead dominic ruccella  northcoast research partners llc hey guys thanks for taking my call this is dominic sitting in for keith noticing on the – given q guidance and what was reported in q did you guys see any business shifts from the second quarter happen to come in a little earlier for you guys and impact your first quarter gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah the gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer yes gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president yes first half is unchanged to our prior expectations q performed a little bit better but the first half remains unchanged dominic ruccella  northcoast research partners llc okay all right and then are you guys seeing any impact on demand from fx coming from internationally mark moon  executive vice president  presidentsales and product operations this is mark dominic we really are not i mean so far as we look at the piece weve made some slight price adjustments in certain places but in general were not seeing any competitive disadvantages certainly the economic pressures in latin america are putting tension on price power for them to purchase but as far as competitive pressures on pricing were not really seeing any dominic ruccella  northcoast research partners llc okay all right thats it for me thank you gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer thanks dominic operator well take our next question from michael genovese with mkm partners please go ahead michael e genovese  mkm partners llc yeah thank you very much you guys recently published an sec document where you had some language in there about a longterm potential shift from products to services and therefore lower gross margins over time so we saw some evidence of that in this quarter but youre not talking about it on the call as a longterm trend so how much should we be thinking about that as a longterm trend versus just adding another risk factor and covering your bases in an sec document gino a bonanotte  chief financial officer  executive vice president well i mean we – its indicative of the backlog position were in weve signed multiple multiyear agreements and services backlog has been growing so the comment just indicated that there will be a movement to services itll make up more of our revenue and the services margin although operating margin is very very similar services margin is a little bit lower than our product margin that was the entire comment gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer yeah i mean at the end of the day we think this is a good thing its a favorable trend having a higher mix of multiyear services is good having annuity based revenue is good having a longterm relationship with the customer is good because we still irrespective of the mix which i think is what we just are formally acknowledging over time as a future trend we think thats a very positive thing to enable and further cement the relationships we have with our customers domestically and internationally having said all that we still think that we can with a lower cost structure improve operating leverage and from an operating margin standpoint maintain or increase the operating margins and cash generation thats associated with the profile of the business in aggregate michael e genovese  mkm partners llc so just to follow up there so youre not saying that theres a fundamental outlook change in the product business the expectations there are on track with your previous expectations or is there a change in the product outlook im just a little bit unclear on that point gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer no just to clarify as gino said product margins are generally comparable we expect them to remain comparable for the balance of the year gross margin pressures servicesoriented as expected in q and q ie first half ie largely driven by norway and some large products we expect the services gross margin to increase in the second half and generally normalize in the mid s michael e genovese  mkm partners llc thanks very much mark moon  executive vice president  presidentsales and product operations and then i think just to tag on just one quick second what we have said and greg just said is product profile really unchanged but we expect our services business to grow faster than our product business in general and so that would lead to this longer term trend its not necessarily something youre going to see in the next two quarters three quarters or four quarters but over time that would be the case michael e genovese  mkm partners llc okay i appreciate the explanation thanks gregory q brown  chairman  chief executive officer thank you operator it appears we have no further questions ill turn the floor back to mr shep dunlap vice president of investor relations for any additional or closing remarks shep dunlap  vice presidentinvestor relations thanks as mentioned at the outset we made a number of forwardlooking statements during the call this includes outlooks on sales gross margins eps opex ebitda other income expense and operating cash flow as well as effective – and cash tax rates the impact of currency public safety lte and lmr regional growth acquisitions capital return and buybacks as well as
