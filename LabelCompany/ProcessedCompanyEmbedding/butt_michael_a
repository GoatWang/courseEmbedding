general physical chemistry physics and chemistry of interfaces rd edition hansj�rgen butt karlheinz graf michael kappl isbn   pages april  description the third edition of this excellent textbook for advanced students in material science chemistry physics biology engineering or for researchers needing background knowledge in surface and interface science the general yet comprehensive introduction to this field focuses on the essential concepts rather than specific details on intuitive understanding rather than learning facts the text reflects the many facets of this discipline by linking physical fundamentals especially those taken from thermodynamics with applicationspecific topics similarly the theory behind important concepts is backed by clearly explained scientificengineering aspects as well as by a wide range of highend applications from microelectronics and biotechnology manifold highend applications from surface technology biotechnology and microelectronics are used to illustrate the basic concepts new to this edition are such hot topics as second harmonic generation spectroscopy surface diffusion mechanisms and measurement of surface diffusion optical spectroscopy of surfaces atomic layer deposition superlubricity bioadhesion and spin coating at the same time the discussions of liquid surfaces the marangoni effect electric double layer measurement of surface forces wetting adsorption and experimental techniques have been updated while the number and variety of exercises are increased and the references updated see more see less table of contents

author information hansj�rgen butt is director at the max planck institue for polymer research in mainz germany he studied physics in hamburg and g�ttingen germany then he went to the maxplanckinstitute of biophysics in frankfurt after receiving his phd in  he went as a postdoc to santa barbara california using the newly developed atomic force microscope from  he spent as a researcher back in germany at the maxplanckinstitute for biophysics in  he became associate professor for physical chemistry at the university mainz three years later full professor at the university of siegen only two years later he joined the maxplanckinstitute of polymer research in mainz and became director for experimental physics karlheinz graf graduated at the institute for physical chemistry in mainz and spent a postdoc year at the university of california santa barbara ucsb he has served as project leader at the maxplanckinstitute for polymer research where his research concentrates on droplet evaporation the structuring of polymer surfaces and on constructing a mpia which is a special afm capable of measuring forces between a solid surface and an adaptive lipid monolayer in a langmuir trough afterwards he was acting professor in the physical and in the analytical chemistry of the university of siegen and later on a staff scientist at the gutmann group at the university of duisburgessen recently he became professor for physical chemistry at the university of applied sciences hochschule niederrhein in krefeld michael kappl studied physics at the university of regensburg and the technical university of munich and did his phd thesis work in ernst bambergs group at the maxplanckinstitute of biophysics in frankfurt after a year of postdoctoral research at the university of mainz in the group of prof butt he worked as a consultant for windows nt network solutions at the pallas soft ag regensburg in  he rejoined the group of prof butt since  he is project leader at the maxplanckinstitute for polymer research by using focused ion beam methods his investigates the adhesion and friction of micro and nanocontacts and capillary forces see more see

introduction to surface and interface science this book focuses on essential concepts and includes application from biotechnology to micoelectronics materials world this textbook is really an excellent reference work for advanced students and their teachers in material science chemistry physics biology engineering or for researchers needing background knowledge in this field i believe that it should be considered mandatory reading for someone who wants to join this research area it is very didactic clear concise and wellorganizedi really enjoyed reading the bookthere are several other books dealing with surface and interface science but this is probably the best for a general introduction to this subject chemphyschem  the book is well worth a place on the shelf of material scientists and engineers involved in surface phenomena materials world  an excellent tool that is highly recommendable to students and experts equally tu chemnitz the book is highly recommended as a source of key information or inspiration and as an introduction to a fascinating and multifacetted field of research and technology advanced materials see more see less related titles surface and

robert conners orlando fl rob says “in response to your recipe request my recipe is simply butt rub seasoned grilled steak i really don’t have a recipe as much as a technique that you may share” to begin with you do not have to pay for an expensive cut of beef to have a steak dinner that tastes like a million my favorite cut which is very reasonable and very tasty is referred to as a chuck eye steak if you find a good cut of it it will be hard to distinguish it from a rib eye in appearance or flavor now for the technique when i am grilling pork chops or steaks my preferred method is to grill from the frozen state as soon as i return from shopping i season generously with butt rub and freeze before grilling the result is the steaks get to takeon the butt rub flavors and the grilling process produces a steak that is grilled well and very flavorful on the outside but remains medium to medium rare or rare  juicy on the inside to go with toss some fresh mushrooms onions peppers etc in a little olive oil and butt rub skewer them grill them and enjoy butt rub® roasted salmon contribution john jacob santa rosa beach fl ingredients fresh salmon fillet with skin removed butt rub®

marinade or any other ingredients grill on a medium high grill until well browned on each side butt rub® ribs ribs are a tough cut of meat a common mistake is cooking at too high a temperature as in grilling slow it down and cook ribs indirectly at approximately ° but first learn to remove the membrane on the back side of the ribs you can lift it up with a metal skewer get a grip and then pull it off this is to allow seasoning to penetrate both sides of the rack and will also help the fat render off from the ribs we season every rib with a moderate application of butt rub® season prior to placing on the grill keep temperature low as mentioned and after the st hour mist the ribs lightly with apple or pineapple juice baby backs will reach ideal tenderness in approximately   hours and spareribs will need approximately  hour more you may choose to “finish” the ribs with applying a sauce or glaze the final  minutes of cooking although these ribs will be delicious without a sauce
