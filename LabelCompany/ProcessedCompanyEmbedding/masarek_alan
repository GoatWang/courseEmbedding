guide » reprints » list rental » tmc homepage ceo spotlight ceo spotlight with vonages alan masarek by erik linask group editorial director    september   share tweet vonage news  alert is now executing upon what the company’s ceo alan masarek calls a historic business transformation – from a residential landline replacement for traditional telecoms serving consumers only to a softwareasaservice company for businesses and consumers internet telephony recently interviewed masarek to find out more tell us more about vonage’s transformation and the thinking behind it alan masarek  masarek we are extending the vonage brand and our legacy as a voip pioneer into the rapidly growing unified communications news  alertasaservice ucaas market for businesses this transformation is fueled by the substantial and predictable cash flow of the consumer business which drives our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital low operating costs driven by the scale of our consumer business the strategic flexibility provided by our support of two technology platforms for our core call processing infrastructure and an accomplished senior leadership team capable of driving this transformation along with talented and committed employees that share a sense of excitement and urgency around the delivery of new products features and customer experience enhancements what has been your role in creating this new path for vonage masarek shortly after i joined vonage i outlined this new direction for the company that included maximizing the profitability of the consumer business while aggressively growing organic revenues and pursuing inorganic growth for vonage business i am focused on establishing vonage as a leading business services brand reinvigorating the company’s culture by returning it to its innovative and disruptive roots and investing in our people so that vonage becomes an employer of choice i’m pleased to say we are making excellent progress on all of those objectives what are some of vonage’s recent successes and its building blocks for the future masarek in late  we purchased vocalocity rebranded vonage business solutions to enter the ucaas smb market an industry that frost  sullivan predicts will grow  percent annually for the next five years to  billion in  vbs’ revenue growth accelerated to  percent nearly double the annual growth rate of other public pureplay ucaas providers underpinning our success is vonage’s ability to leverage the iconic vonage brand and low cost structure while utilizing our strong balance sheet to invest in growth with this acquisition playbook established we completed the acquisition of telesphere news  alert networks in  and simplesignal in  these three companies now collectively known as vonage business give us a comprehensive and compelling range of cloudbased solutions to address the needs of a wide range of enterprises further still this strategic shift is quickly repositioning vonage to a saas news  alert model from its legacy roots as a telecom provider we also acquired gunify a saas integration company whose technology connects our communications platform with the most widely used saas business applications including salesforce for crm and google for work for productivity this type of service is in high demand by businesses who want to move to the cloud because until recently it could only be obtained through traditional much more expensive onpremises pbx news  alert systems gunify’s cloud solution enables us to provide functionality comparable with traditional onpremises offerings what has made this combination of acquisitions successful masarek our success is driven by strong demand for cloudbased communications and vonage’s ability to serve all segments of the business market we have the right platforms and product set to serve singleperson companies to those with thousands of employees spread over multiple locations while we are growing quickly in the midmarket and with larger companies within the smb segment we continue to see excellent growth potential with smaller businesses it’s important to highlight that  percent of all employer companies in the us have fewer than  employees and this segment is rapidly embracing the cloud we are also very successful in serving business customers at the mid to upper ends of the market these customers generally require quality of service or qos service level agreements and enterprisegrade feature sets matching those traditionally provided by onpremises pbx vendors what trends do you expect will have the most significant impact on vonage business’ growth going forward masarek one of the biggest changes in communications over the next few years will be the explosion of cloud communications adoption which we are only seeing the beginning of today everyone has heard that large carriers are moving forward with their plans to sunset their copper wire infrastructures and these and other changes will continue to drive continued adoption within the business sector accordingly this mass shift to hosted telephony solutions will continue to redefine the way people are able to communicate every day business communications running on software hosted in the cloud means that any dataenabled device across the internet of things has the potential to become a new telephony endpoint today we are seeing a lot of buzz around things like wearable communication devices but tomorrow that attention could shift to something like smart tvs or connected cars also as the lines between an individual’s personal and business identities continue to blur thanks in large part to the continuing byod trend communications companies like vonage will need to develop new user experiences that enable users to seamlessly transition between their different use cases during the course of any given day more and more people will need to switch easily between their personal and business identities across all of their devices is cloud the answer to addressing all these needs masarek communications flowing through the cloud will help companies of all sizes to realize the benefits of unified communications because solutions can be tied together easily and offered at a fraction of the cost of traditional telephony even a sole proprietor working from home will be able to capitalize on the value that a unified communications solution provides over the next few years more technologies will emerge that remove the need to build individual networks or communities to communicate through a company’s telephony solution of choice we’ll see technologies that allow anytime communications that are platform and device agnostic and can occur to and from any device not just apptoapp or platformtoplatform also we’ll see more solutions that offer text and group messaging to any number in your business or personal directory and that will continue to expand across the complete range of communication endpoints you won’t need to be concerned about whether the person you are trying to reach is using the same app or the same operating system where does mobility fit in masarek the trends that will have significant impact are mobility increased competition and the need to boost productivity while maintaining costs the workforce is becoming more mobile and employees need the flexibility to work from anywhere on devices that can do more the office is not necessarily a physical office anymore and unnecessary downtime away from the office can result in lost revenues if the business is not optimized for a mobile workforce  with new competition and disruptive models hitting businesses from different angles it can sometimes be hard to compete especially for smaller businesses but with cloud technologies a business can quickly scale remain flexible and compete more effectively with existing competitors and unexpected challengers and businesses are always looking to improve productivity without increasing head count this dovetails with my point about being mobile the cloud allows employees to be productive from anywhere how do all these factors come together to create a differentiated service offering masarek vonage’s business solutions provide support for virtually any endpoint that a business may need to address for example a very small business may operate out of someone’s home and only require mobile and desktop support while a large enterprise with hundreds of employees spread across many different locations may need support from everything from desk phones to tablets to video presence and collaboration tools along with business application integration vonage has the ability to unify communications across all of these endpoints this enables users to leverage their business telephony functionality from any device and integrate their communications with their everyday workflow programs like those for crm or productivity in addition vonage has the unique ability to deliver our cloud communications solutions through whatever type of connectivity best suits the needs of the customer our portfolio of business products can serve singleperson companies to those with thousands of employees spread over multiple locations vonage provides bringyourownbroadband byob cloud products and those that offer carriergrade reliability and quality of service qos across byob service options and its private national mpls network this ensures companies have the complete range of options for telephony and broadband connectivity enabling them to deploy solutions that meet their business needs today and into the future     vonage also offers userfriendly management tools that allow customers to monitor their communications services and quickly and easily make changes from their pcs smartphones or tablets our proprietary provisioning platform zeus allows partners to make changes for customers from any device in short vonage offers a great brand a financially stable company and the history and longevity of being a pioneer and expert in internet communications with a track record for quality reliability and great service building

morning everyone and thanks for joining us  was a pivotal year for vonage we’ve established the foundation for longterm growth and leadership in cloud communications three key strengths that’s driven our success first our ability to leverage corporate assets from our consumer segment including our highly aware brand strong cash flows and the scale of the vonage voice network these assets have propelled our transformation second our ability to acquire great companies at attractive prices and grow them organically and third our ability to create a unique value proposition to drive better outcomes for our business customers we are going to use slides today to accompany our remarks so please lets move to slide  to discuss  highlights our team continues to deliver strong operational and financial results we grew consolidated revenues to  million a  increase in our third consecutive year of topline growth for vonage business revenues increased  yearoveryear adjusted oibda was  million an  increase we completed the acquisition of nexmo which continues to grow rapidly achieving  pro forma yearoveryear annual revenue growth even more important than a strong revenue growth nexmo expands our capabilities by combining ucaas and cpaas into an integrated solution which gives vonage the right set of assets necessary to win in cloud communications in addition to our product investments we also used our strong cash flows to invest further in our growth including significant investments in our sales infrastructure we also strengthened our board with the addition of two new directors with substantial bb experience gary steele ceo of proofpoint and hamid akhavan the former ceo of unify and former ceo of tmobile lastly as was press released this morning we are partnering with amazon web services to combine our ucaas products with amazons new collaboration suite named amazon chime to provide unmatched productivity to business use i will provide more on the amazon deal in a moment but lets first move to slide  to discuss our most important strategic initiative which is the continued build out of our product offerings to enhance our customer value proposition and to drive growth with the acquisition of nexmo now known as the vonage api platform customers can choose between two service delivery options for their communication needs they can buy vonage as a ucaas subscription or they can access our vonage api platform and consume our cloud communication services as programmable modules delivered via software apis when combined with our ability to tie into other cloudbased workplace tools like crm and productivity vonage integrates the entire business communications value chain from employee communications that maximize productivity to the direct engagement with customers that cpaas provide when combined with mpls network as well as voice services over customers own broadband networks via our smartwan solutions we create a truly differentiated offering that strengthens relationships with our customers as i reflect back on the year im proud of our teams accomplishments we’ve assembled the most comprehensive product offering in the cloud communications market and we continue to build a team capable of executing on our enormous opportunity now lets move to slide  to discuss vonage business this year we significantly built out sales infrastructure and distribution channels we ended  with field sales offices in  markets we expect to open nine more cities in  bringing our total to  markets we recently hired kenny wyatt formerly president of business solutions with centurylink as our chief revenue officer kenny brings a wealth of experience in enterprise communications sales and operations and will benefit from kennys deep omnichannel sales experience for customer segments ranging from smb to larger enterprise vonage business had a strong quarter of revenue growth we delivered q revenues of  million a  yearoveryear increase vonage business accounted for  of consolidated revenues in the quarter and we expect business revenues to overtake consumer revenues this year now let’s move to slide  let me highlight several fourth quarter accomplishments within our ucaas family of products first as i mentioned we entered into a strategic partnership with amazon web services that was announced via aws press release this morning aws launched amazon chime their web conferencing and collaboration suite that provides audio conferencing video collaboration services vonage is awss ucaas launch partner for amazon chime our partnership with aws is industry shaping because the integration of our ucaas solutions with amazons collaboration tools brings unmatched productivity to business users we believe aws chose us as its ucaas partner because our leadership in cloud voice communications matches well with amazons leadership in cloud services the bundled vonage plus amazon chime product offerings will be available late in q vonage will sell the bundle offering through our sales channels and amazon will sell the bundle through its web assets moving to slide  our enterprise sales team won partycity the worlds largest supplier of decorated party goods partycity selected us for their  users across  locations replacing their incumbent cloud provider because of our ability to unify all their stores on one hosted cloud platform guaranteeing qos with vonages smartwan solution over broadband as well as our mpls network our channel sales team have secured a new contract with telarus one of the largest master agents in the us in which vonage was selected as the supplier of ucaas services to one of the largest public propertycasualty insurance companies in the us and finally we continue to see good growth from existing customers one of the best examples is wework which added more than  seats in q bringing the total to  seats across the us canada germany and the uk now lets turn to nexmo the vonage api platform on slide  where the team also delivered strong results in q vonage api platform revenues were  million a  yearoveryear increase we continue to build on the momentum of our merger with nexmo and our combined teams are delivering across three key initiatives first we expanded our portfolio of voice api with substantial increases in functionality second we significantly increased our distribution footprint by aggressively entering the us market leveraging the strength of the vonage sales force and voice network advantages revenue from usbased customers increased  sequentially in the quarter third we meaningfully increased the brand awareness of the vonage api platform in fact by increasing investments in digital marketing and developer relations and by leveraging the strength of the vonage brand we significantly increased our number of registered developers to  we’ve also seen excellent growth from existing nexmo customers notable among these nexmo has had a relationship with amazon web services that predates our amazon chime deal for aws nexmo enables the delivery of sms messages as part of awss simple notification service in q messages delivered on behalf of aws increased  sequentially regarding vapi which is our voice api we’re seeing strong traction and the sales pipeline in the us is much higher than any other markets because of our marketing efforts and lead sharing between salesforces we also delivered more vapi functionality during the quarter by adding direct support for web sites in q ibm watson used websocket support in our voice api and delivered voiceenabled experiences through their watson artificial intelligence applications finally on slide  you can see how our strategy comes together by integrating the entire business communications value chain we integrate customer facing communications via cpaas and to employee communications via ucaas into the other cloudbased workplace tools such as crm productivity we are seeing early success from customers who are choosing vonage because we offer both cpaas and ucaas solutions for example electronic restoration services selected vonage for their  seats ucaas deployment and they’re also using our sms apis to enable contextual communications with their customers to improve customer engagement weve also added cpaas solutions to an existing  seats ucaas customer which has resulted in improved workforce management i cite these examples because combining our ucaas and cpaas solutions has meaningfully improved our customer conversations in ways our competitors will struggle to match lastly let me review our results in our consumer segment where we continue to execute well revenue was a  million a  decline and in line with our expectations we ended the quarter with  million subscribers  of which are tenured meaning they’ve been with us for more than two years for the fullyear of  churn was  which is in historic low these results continue to highlight the consumer segment cash flow generating ability while the segment concurrently delivers us massive voice scale which enables direct peering with major carriers these peering relationships give us quality and cost advantages over the competition that translate into our ucaas and cpaas product lines particularly for our rollout of our voice api in the us to summarize we had a very strong  and we’re well positioned for  our sales infrastructure solutions set and brand building we accomplished last year serve as the base in a multiyear growth opportunity and we expect  financial performance to reflect our focus on strong service revenue growth in vonage business and continue harvesting of cash flow from consumer i am truly excited about our vision and the assets weve assembled to fulfill it in just three years we built the largest revenue base in cloud communications as compared to our pure play competitors and i believe the most strategic product offering by integrating our ucaas and cpaas solutions while we’ve accomplished much there is more to do to realize our full potential and its incredibly energizing to think about all the opportunity that remains in front of us thanks again for your support now i will turn the call to dave for more detail on our financial results and  guidance dave pearson thanks alan and good morning everyone  was the year in which we achieved our financial goals of producing record revenue strong cash flow while funding organic growth and strategic acquisitions before we review the results for the fourth quarter and fullyear  i’d like to discuss the additional information we will be reporting starting today both for the year  and going forward as noted on page  consistent with vonages continued transformation into a leader in business cloud communications we’re providing more visibility into financial trends in the business and consumer segments for each of consumer and business which represents our ucaas and cpaas product offerings we will report both revenue and cost of service each broken down by type we believe this additional information in conjunction with our other kpis will provide greater transparency into our progress and insights into our execution in each segment as in the past i would also like to note that the quarterly growth rates reflected in our presentation slides during our prepared remarks are on a yearoveryear basis unless otherwise noted as sequential with that lets begin on slide  consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was  million up  million or  due to organic business growth and the addition of nexmo for the fullyear consolidated revenue was  million also up  the increase was due to substantially higher business revenue partially offset by planned reductions in consumer revenue moving to slide  let me now turn to our segment financial results for the fourth quarter starting with vonage business which consist of our ucaas and cpaas products segment results can be found in table  of our press release were now providing the following business revenue and direct cost metrics service product which consists of customer premise equipment broadband access and mpls professional services and shipping and handling and contributions to the universal service fund or usf which are a pass through vonage business total revenue was  million a  increase of this  million was ucaas which grew  organically and  million was cpaas which grew  organically or pro forma ucaas revenue in the quarter was impacted by several onetimers including sla credits and bad debt writeoffs q is a seasonally high quarter for cpaas and certain corporate customers are on special holiday campaigns service revenue which includes all ucaas and cpaas revenue grew  to  million service margin during the fourth quarter was  down from  this decline in service margin is due entirely to the acquisition of nexmo as the api product currently has lower gross margins for the fullyear vonage business revenue was  million a  increase service revenue was  million up  reflecting significant organic growth in ucaas and the june  acquisition and subsequent organic growth of nexmo fourth quarter average ucaas revenue per seat was  flat from  a yearago revenue churn was  flat sequentially and up from  in the year ago quarter vonage business grew total seats to  up  reflecting strong organic growth as alan noted cpaas registered developers increased dramatically in q to  moving to slide  we’re now providing the following consumer revenue and direct cost metrics service product which consists primarily of voip routers provided to new customers and usf total consumer revenue for the fourth quarter was  million down  for the fullyear total consumer revenue was  million also down  both consistent with our expectations consumer service margin for the fourth quarter and the year  was  reflecting our ability to hold margins relatively stable despite a declining topline consumer customer churn for the fourth quarter was  consistent with the prior and yearago quarters we expect churn to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal and competitive factors but to stay in this general range consumer average revenue per line in q is  down from  yearoveryear due to lower usf which is a passthrough turning to slide  let me now build up to adjusted oibda consolidated sales and marketing expense for the fourth quarter was  million down  million this decline reflects the continued shift to more efficient media channels and from marketing to sales for the fullyear sales and marketing was down  million reflecting much more efficient media spend partially offset by significant investments in salesforce headcount across all sales channels general and administrative expense for the fourth quarter were  million up  million fullyear ga was  million up  million this increase reflects the addition of nexmo and in the case of the fullyear nexmo acquisition related costs fourth quarter adjusted oibda was  million up  million fullyear adjusted oibda was  million up  adjusted net income for the quarter was  million or  per share down  million fullyear adjusted net income was  million or  per share up  from  million or  per share in the prior year the adjusted net income metric removes noncash items such as amortization of intangibles from acquired companies and acquisition related items we also recorded an adjustment to income taxes related to these exclusions turning ahead to slide  capex for the quarter was  million for the year capex was  million net of reimbursable headquarters improvements up from  million this year we advanced or completed several important capital projects including consolidating down to four key us data centers including our central data center at our new jersey headquarters and building certain field sales offices as well as deploying success based capital into broadworks licenses and cpe free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and acquisition and development of software assets was  million in the fourth quarter down from  million due to a  million prepayment to acquire a longterm hosting capacity at advantageous pricing and other working capital uses free cash flow for the year was  million down from  million reflecting the previously mentioned prepayment and other working capital uses adjusted oibda minus capex was  million in the fourth quarter up  million or  and  million for  up  million or  in  we returned  million to shareholders through our buyback program repurchasing  million shares at the highly accretive average price of  per share this represents onethird of our four year  million authorization which were halfway through after two years of execution since beginning the repurchase of stock in august  we’ve bought back  million shares of vonage stock for  million the highly accretive average price of  our buyback has provided strong returns for shareholders and it continues to be one of the components of our capital allocation plan to be deployed at managements discretion cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  were  million the data center capacity and other cash prepayments totaling over  million sit on the balance sheet as prepaid expenses until the service is utilized in addition we made a  million phone sale associated with a pending enterprise customer contract which sits in deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue in the future taking all of these items into account net debt was  million and we ended the quarter with net debt to trailing adjusted oibda of x the  million credit facility we put in place in the middle of  continue to provide significant committed borrowing capacity moving on to guidance on slide  our expectations for the fullyear  are as follows consolidated revenue is expected to be in the range of  million to  million as we discussed throughout  as an objective we expect that business revenue will exceed consumer revenue in  the business we expect total vonage business revenue which includes both ucaas and cpaas to be in the range of  million to  million for gaap revenue growth in the  area this takes into account our plan to deploy access more selectively in  meaning that service revenue will grow a bit faster in total revenues to give some commentary on timing of business revenue development revenue will ramp throughout the year with q representing the smallest sequential dollar increase of the year in part due to the seasonally high fourth quarter in cpaas we expect a sequential dollar growth to ramp throughout the year cpaas this is driven by our awareness efforts crossselling and vapi adoption and in ucaas by the opening of new markets and increasing salesforce productivity consumer revenue is expected to contribute between  million and  million as we continue to focus on optimizing this segment profitability and cash flow the actual dollar decline in consumer will be less than in  using some simplified cost allocation assumptions we currently expect consumer to print over  million of aftertax free cash flow that’s cash flow minus capex minus taxes through  regarding cash flow we expect to deliver at least  million of adjusted oibda in  as with revenue adjusted oibda will scale through the year this is due to investments we expect to make in the first half to build out our business salesforce and cpaas awareness we expect capex to be in line with  at approximately  million combining the components of guidance i just discussed we expect to generate at least  million of operating free cash flow or adjusted oibda minus capex in  this cash flow generation is a strategic and financial differentiator for vonage the strong free cash low leverage and our low cost revolving credit facility continue to have meaningful financial flexibility this was evidenced by our ability to strike quickly to acquire nexmo with a compelling deal structure that was  thank you for your continued support to vonage ill now turn the call back over to hunter to initiate the qa session hunter blankenbaker okay great thank you dave karen lets please turn it over to the qa session questionandanswer session operator certainly operator instructions our first question for today comes from the line of george sutton from craighallum george sutton thank you and dave i appreciate the additional disclosures so alan you  for the first time at least that i’ve heard you say this you’re starting to talk about ucaas and cpaas as sort of an eitheror model and some of the discussions you’re having with customers are driven by that can you go into a little more detail on that in another words are you literally coming and saying we got this or this and we can be very flexible in terms of how we set you up is that effectively what youre saying alan masarek george no its not its actually not an eitheror what i was trying to say that they are very complementary and so when you go into a customer they generally require both all customers are communicating to their customers of course and also looking to bring their employee based communications to the cloud their pbx system to the cloud so what we’re finding is its just changing the customer conversation so there is an opportunity to syllable that was really the rationale for when we bought nexmo was that you saw this convergence between the need to link external customer facing communications with the internal employee based communications so its really not an eitheror its both but you can get the lead from one or the other of course george sutton got you okay i just want to make sure i understood that and then as my followup i will migrate over to amazon and just give us a better sense in terms of being a launch partner what sort of resource dedication do you have to them what sort of resource dedication did they have to you my assumption is you will be reselling their services i dont believe they will be reselling your services but i just want to be clear about that alan masarek it’s a shared deal theyll be reselling the bundle they will be excuse me selling the bundle through their web assets while we will be selling the bundle as well through all of our channels so it really is one plus one equals three proposition george sutton perfect okay thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of rich valera from needham  company richard valera thank you i just wonder if you could give a little more color on the growth expectations for the respective parts of the business segment particularly nexmo and ucaas and maybe relate them to the fourth quarter growth rates i think they were  and  respectively but how do we expect those to trend into  dave pearson hi rich its dave so first of all we’re thinking about this we’re in a very dynamic and competitive market and were thinking about increasingly cpaas and ucaas as one business across which we’re dynamically able to allocate capital that being said as we sit here today cpaas looks like a mid  organic grower and ucaas looks like a mid teen percent organic grower on ucaas service revenue will actually grow a bit faster mid to high teens as i mentioned in my script it will be a bit less access and a bit less product and service which is mmr is what we’re focused on richard valera i know you mentioned dave that you were going to deploy access more selectively in  why is that dave pearson sure yes its not about withholding it in any way its really about the fact that the salesforce now has essentials and premier as kind of both products the pure over the top products and the fully integrated qos product in their sales bag across the sales channels and so where it fits for a customer and they dont need qos we’ve got the ability to sell them essentials we’ve also in some cases have the ability to sell the premier product over the top or without qos so its simply making sure that the  that it’s the right application for access because there is cost that comes along with that but we continue to believe in the right circumstances that it is the right product and especially in the enterprise where people are very concerned about quality you’re still going to see access alan masarek i will just add one followup to that its our smartwan tools which is sd wan softwaredefined wide area networking we branded as smartwan lets us provide qos even in a broadband situation so its less necessary at times to pull the private circuit in that office to have a dedicated voice line smartwan can handle that now in certain situations you to pull the private circuit when others you can provide qos via smartwan so you sort of think about the gradations of delivery you go from sheer over the top up the smartwan delivery up further to leading  to actually pull a private circuit and sell access and because of the growth in smartwan we’re seeing a lot of success and that’s really why you’re going to see less sale of that or a slower growth in access richard valera got it thanks for that clarification operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of catharine trebnick from dougherty catharine trebnick hi guys thanks for taking my question can you just give us a little bit more background on what percentage of revenue you expect amazon chime could be by the end of  for modeling purposes thanks alan masarek hey catharine its alan i cant give you a percentage the product we expect will release the end of q and were going to initially distributed to our base of customers as a  an added element of functionality for free and then theyll be selling and amazon will be selling it through their web assets where they become a distribution channel for us were very excited about the prospect but we dont know how successful its going to be so we cant provide a percentage if you will in terms of how significant its going to be but this is a important strategic relationship catharine trebnick and then in addition to them how much of nexmo might be folded into the amazon chime opportunity going forward alan masarek its really not a nexmo issue relative to the chime situation the chime is a marriage between the ucaas solution and the chime  audio conferencing video and collaboration system we separately have a lot of business through nexmo with amazon web services i mentioned on the call aws has as one of their products their simple notification service where we provide the sms delivery for them that is growing substantially as i mentioned that was up  the volume of messages was up  sequentially in the quarter catharine trebnick all right thank you alan i will catch you guys on the post call bye bye alan masarek thanks catharine operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dmitry netis from william blair dmitry netis can you guys hear me alan masarek yes dmitry netis okay thank you couple of questions i joined a little bit late so i apologize if i’m being repetitive but for nexmo what are you guys projecting in  the street was baking in  million i’m wondering are you still in that range lower or higher and whether you’re going to continue to report it sounds like maybe not since you’re talking about unifying ucaas and cpaas into one reporting segment but it doesn’t look like nexmo will be split up going forward is that correct dave pearson so the plan is to report the way we reported today which is business as one segment and increasingly where we’ve put the two operations together we will be giving color from a product perspective on cpaas and ucaas where its relevant we did answer before a question on cpaas growth and we said it was going to be on an organic basis so pro forma if we owned it for all of  it will grow in the mid s the implication there as you recall when we bought it we said that we thought it would do in  because we’re buying it at x between a  million and  million of revenue in  the mid s implies the very upper end of that guidance dmitry netis got it okay dave thanks and then just in general and if i take that comment roll that into your guidance for  and look where ucaas is shaping ph out consumer slightly down from what the street has been predicting as well i don’t think you will be penalized too much for that given sort of the trajectory of that business there but the expectation has been for both vonage business ucaas side of the business there as well as nexmo to reaccelerate in terms of organic growth going into  so is there anywhere along the line maybe second half that you would feel now that you got that guidance i don’t want to put words in your mouth do you feel that’s a conservative guide to give you a little bit of room to outperform those numbers going through the year and show that growth that you’ve outlined last year alan masarek i think we put together and communicated an achievable plan and throughout the year we did a lot of building in  we still had building to do in  and we got a new cro and we feel very very good about that so we will be updating as we go but there is certainly that opportunity dmitry netis okay great and then a couple more on the  looking at the eps missing by about two penny here that’s entirely due to taxes it seems like but maybe im missing something but if you could comment on that dave and then that the prepayment that you mentioned that affected your free cash flow can you walk me over that one once again and whether that’s still going to recur or is that onetime thing that … dave pearson sure dmitry netis … you expect to recur in  timeframe dave pearson so yes on net income that difference is tax is gaap taxes and just in general net income has a lot of noise in it right now because we made acquisitions so we’ve amortization we also have payments as you recall a portion of the considerations in nexmo employees and they owned a big part of the company vests over the course of the year as an incentive tool so that’s also in ga and net income as it relates to the prepayments this was for a hosting capacity and several other products that were able to acquire the services in bulk we do not expect thatll be a regular occurrence and for instance this hosting capacity it’s the amount which we prepurchased is counted in years not months so i would not expect those types of payments occur on a regular basis and that will be bled off of the balance sheet into our operating cost as they’re consumed operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of greg burns from sidoti gregory burns good morning when we look at the ebitda guidance for  is more than  of that still coming from consumer or are we  can we read or is the business segment is going to be a break even for  or still at a little loss could you give us a little more color on the complexion of that ebitda guidance dave pearson yes so first of all yes we can we are a functional organization and you know we are able to segment from a gross margin perspective its much more difficult to pull apart below that and get to oibda but if you use some simplified allocation assumptions obviously you have a lot of cash flow coming from consumer you’re going to be around breakeven in business and you’re going to be investing in nexmo those are the three components that go into the  gregory burns okay so business ex nexmo ucaas is about at a breakeven and nexmos … dave pearson yes breakeven to positive in ucaas gregory burns okay dave pearson investment in nexmo and highly positive in consumer gregory burns okay and then i just wanted to dig in on the slowdown in the ucaas growth i guess this quarter there was some items impacting it could you just touch on those items again and then just looking into  is it something you are proactively doing where we’re only going to see kind of a mid to high teens type growth as opposed to kind of what we saw in  or is it just scale or market related issues that are kind of weighing on the growth number for next year dave pearson sure so just to unpack the numbers and then alan can comment on this as well if you look just  if you go to table  in the press release and you look at service revenue versus product revenue you will actually  in business and you take out nexmo which is the revenue of which is footnoted you will actually see this product revenue that went down in the quarter if you look at service revenue its actually up  million just in ucaas in the quarter to that  million of organic growth you add service credits which were  to  elevated in the fourth quarter so you then got a quarter that has  million of service growth and did not benefit from some onetimers that we had in q which included a usf increase which is not in service but its in total and some other equalization of fees so when you put that altogether we actually had a strong organic growth quarter in ucaas the other component that is working against that you’re seeing in product is bad debt on equipment so we had about  there but that cost a  swing because that  was  it was  higher in q and it should have been and we took that out of q so that actually made a  swing there in addition on equipment we are increasingly moving to a rental model so you’re taking money out of in quarter and you’re spreading it over subsequent quarter so you can  really a lot of the difference relative to expectations within product for the reasons that i cited in terms of longterm growth and growth for the year really goes back to what we said before which is we believe this is an achievable plan that reflects a fully built machine at the lowend  at the lower end of the market where were absolutely doing everything we can and feel like we have a very very strong position in that market and then continues to build out and continued execution of the longer sales cycles at the midmarket and particularly in the enterprise operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of tim horan from oppenheimer tim horan thank guys can you give us more color on the amazon relationship are they actually going to be using you for voice services are they reselling your voice network and the  price point that they have is that kind of embedded with your service in that new product the churn product thanks alan masarek hey tim its alan so they  i mentioned before to an earlier question they will sell our product our ucaas solution bundled with chime on their web assets what we’re doing is we’re taking their premium chime and providing it free to our base and the  as just a value adder the opportunity is for us to then take a product that they sell at their premium at  and we can then go to our base and say here is this amount of value that is provided at no additional cost tim horan so would your voice capabilities embedded with chime how much are they going to be charging for that alan masarek we will not  well they will be charging what we charge in effect because they’re not going to  we cannot obviously have them create channel conflict in the sale of our products so that’s all been addressed in the deal and this has been a relationship its been underway for very long its been in the works for a very long period of time they actually have an incentive to sell our product as well as a distribution channel for us tim horan so your product embedded with chime what do you think they’re going to be charging for that joe redling it will be our  this is joe it will be our standard pricing we are actually their ucaas provider in their web assets so those links will come into our channel and we will be pricing that based on the number of seats just like we did today in our own channel so we control the pricing of the entire process tim horan okay are they your customers or amazons customers who chose then joe redling they’re our customers tim horan okay sorry that makes a lot more sense and is this going to be more of a global offering or is it more us based joe redling us based operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of mike latimore from northland capital markets michael latimore hey guys thanks a lot on the ucaas business is it  should we assume essentials and premier growth at a similar rate or do you think one will clearly grow faster than the other in  alan masarek i think its fairly even clearly theres a lot less friction at the lower end and so that is a positive for essentials and historically it has grown faster at the same time our data and our experience shows that the upper end of the market is actually growing faster now to just the tam and the adoption because its earlier so those two things are cancelling each other out for the year at a highlevel michael latimore got it and then again with regard to amazon chime do you think that offering is more attractive to the essentials or premier base and also i mean you guys already have conferencing ph applications so i guess if a customer wants to have the conferencing feature how do you sort of position chime versus what you already have alan masarek yes mike so obviously the collaboration suite this productivity suite is pretty compelling we think its you really got to get above   seats for this type of suite so what we’re excited about is across both our platforms whether its essentials or premier this is an option we think will be very attractive to the customer base so on the essential side we believe that helps us to move up market to a  plus  plus seat through our inside sales channel that is filling a collaboration suite void we had before so we think that’s a very positive thing for us on that side we do have collaboration features through our premier offering but either one of those will be up to the customers choice to choose so it gives us both a much richer feature set for what i would call the small to mid which is     seats that we can put across all our channel so it gives us advantages across all michael latimore yes okay thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of will power from baird william power great thanks just a couple of questions i know you’ve gotten asked this a couple of times but just thinking about the ucaas market some of your competitors have been talking about accelerating growth in the mid market and enterprise it sounds like you’re seeing that to a degree but you’re not perhaps manifested to the same degree on the revenue growth outlook for  so i was just trying to understand is there anything new competitively from skype or others or some of your other competitors and again just trying to  just parse the growth rate expectations for  versus what you’ve had here over the last one to two years alan masarek no we’ve not seen a change in the competitive landscape make clearly as i’ve just noted the mid market in enterprise is  has lower penetration and therefore it is growing faster the competition there is intense it is more intense than it is at the lower end but it hasn’t increased or decreased as of late i would say that our model is one that where we’ve been very focused on building a balanced set of sales channels i think you’ve seen various competitors swing very hard away from direct and towards channel we’ve been doing a lot of state work to make sure that were very balanced across that and i think that that takes a little bit more time but i think it will put us in very good stead in terms of the infrastructure the other thing is that we mentioned it a little bit before but that lot of enterprises the key for them to go to the cloud is having that qos because they’re just not willing to be over the top and so we think that is the approach that we offer at the highend with premier at the same time those entities that want qos also tend to have a longer sales cycle and when you are offering access and that type of service delivery which these companies want you also have a longer install cycle so you’re just seeing that in the numbers and i think that help to explain the difference william power okay and then maybe just quickly on the buyback from here what’s the key driver what kind of underpins the plans to utilize the rest of that timing or magnitude as you look over the next  to  months dave pearson sure so the board authorized two years ago  million and we intend to execute that  million buyback we after two years were at exactly halfway through it were exactly  we bought almost exactly half the amount of stock so we intend to continue to execute that i think for the last several quarters we reached up and bought nexmo which was an irreplaceable asset and used cash to do it we decided that the strategic flexibility was important and we wanted to use some of that capital to deleverage over the last couple of quarters and also have the flexibility to do what we did back in may when the stock hold back we acquired well over  million of stock in a two weeks period not only providing  i think a very good backstop to investors but also just making some highly accretive trades we want to continue to have that ability we want to continue to delever so really it’s a question of balancing those things but we fully intend to execute on the  million and two years from now be finished with the program operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of adam ilkowitz from citi adam ilkowitz hi thanks for taking the question i was wondering  you were talking about the costs and the investments being made to nexmo if we look at your service revenue margin in business as you reported how would we look at just the ucaas side of the business do you feel you are at a margin that is similar to a peer level or your consumer business or if not how long would it take to get there and is the question more about scale or is it about something else thank you alan masarek sure so you we are  you get a sense of what service margin is without nexmo when you look back to the fourth quarter of last year that’s the ucaas business by itself although its improved since then just with bigger scale and nexmo we talked about and with nexmo service margin and gross margin are the same because there is no usf and there is no product or service delivery or anything like that we made a filing over the summer which after the acquisition which talk specifically about nexmo gross margin and service margin and that right now during this land grab ph phase is in the  area we think that there is near and mediumterm upside to those numbers but clearly during this land grab we’re trying to optimize adoption of the apis and repositioning nexmo or diversifying nexmo into other markets and in particular us voice that has the benefits of greater  of a longer tail of customers greater diversity in customers but it also happens to be where the higher margin is  voice is it’s a highermargin product us is a highermargin market and for us in us voice that’s where we really get the advantages of our network which is where i think theres is a good amount of margin accretion so as that mix shift occurs towards us voice and its going to take time because we’re still growing on the international sms side as well and we get the benefits of scale you’re going to start to see that gross margin or service margin go up adam ilkowitz and just one final one you mentioned on the slides in talking about your own remarks about having financial flexibility and you talked about the buyback program being somewhat dependent on ma can you just talk about the landscape and what if anything you need whether its from a product or geographical standpoint what interests you in the market these days thanks alan masarek sure so we first of all we think see everything just based on our position in the industry and the fact that we’ve been acquisitive and so really falls into the three categories one is continued ucaas consolidation and that’s there the assets of the smaller players are not getting more expensive and so those are things that we can execute on but that’s  those are purely  in general they’re purely customer acquisition or sales force acquisition place for us so they’re almost like organic growth youre just increasing organic growth second would be things like nexmo that are technology driven addons or product enhancements we dont feel like we need to do anything there for instance in contact center we got very good products there some are embedded in broadsoft simple versions are embedded in central and then we’ve retail relationships where necessary but we still look at things like that like nexmo and technology enhancements dont feel like we have to do anything and the last piece would be industry consolidation and as we think that’s heating up and there wont be as many ucaas companies in two years as there are today again we dont feel like we need to do anything there or that theres anything eminent but we think its going to happen and with our balance sheet and cash flow we can be a driver and control our own destiny in that if it occurs operator thank you and this concludes our questionandanswer session for today i’d like to turn the conference over back to hunter blankenbaker for any closing comments hunter blankenbaker okay thank you karen and that concludes our call today we look forward to speaking you

vonage’s master plan  getvoip august   by matt grech ceo alan masarek weighs in on vonage’s master plan featured in since this time last year vonage has been drastically changing the company has been seen making a number of recent moves in what can only be described as a total transformation a shift from the provider’s residentialconsumer roots with the recent acquisition of nexmo a provider of apis for sms voice and phone functionalities it’s clear the company is looking to boost its current standing as a business voip provider of cloud communications for the smb and enterprise jumping on nexmo early vonage is looking to leverage a robust network infrastructure to allow for far more flexible communication between customers employees and even productivity tools to bridge the gap between what were previously proprietary islands but how does this all fit together in the grand scheme surely this one acquisition isn’t the only piece of the puzzle to make sense of it all we recently had the chance to speak with alan masarek the current ceo of vonage who has been guiding the company since november  under alan vonage has really begun its shift in not only offerings but even the existing culture and mission for the company a company wide transformation as alan put it in his own words “this transformation of the company has rippled through everything in terms of reorganization from business units to a functional organization structure to a meaningful upscale of the talent to changing the culture of the company – we’ve been able to about double the enterprise value of the company along the way we’ve fundamentally changed the operating profit of the consumer market and that has funded all these things we’ve seen our brand move from its roots as a residential brand to more a business brand” in just the second quarter of  vonage announced reported revenue of  million up from a previous  million from the previous year ago quarter and about  revenue growth for vonage business alone this figure includes  million of nexmo revenue for a total of  million in revenue for vonage business ending seats for the were in business were  which was up from  seats in the year ago quarter – this is a  increase in the number of seats hooked up to the vonage business service this isn’t just pocket change and collecting pennies from the sofa there is a clear shift in vonage’s strategy and market focus and it is evident in just this one quarter alone alan explained the company has been utilizing its consumer side of the business cash flow “to optimize its cash flows and extend” these flows as alan put it in order to fund this entire transformation but vonage doesn’t want to simply be another enterprise voip or hosted pbx provider they’re hoping to move beyond just that and do what no other provider has before – bridge the existing gaps within unified communication platforms to create one single experience to work seamlessly for both the teams utilizing the software but more important the customer who is utilizing the product changing the face of the industry as the cloud and communication industry develop in the next  to  months alan thinks “you’re going to see increasingly this marriage or collision between this traditional cpaas model – the nexmo model – and the ucaas model” he said “the fact that one has been targeted on customer communications and the other has been targeted internally on internal communications we really think this is sort of a historical artifact that is not going to persist it’s going to integrate into a bigger model” and vonage wants to use the recent nexmo acquisition as part of their plan to do just that – to connect these previously isolated proprietary islands of communication and workflow the idea is simple why should your employees use a different service to contact each other then another to contact customers and then a completely separate crm or workflow management tool as independent silos it can add to confusion and cut down on everyone’s favorite word – productivity alan envisions a different world a connect world a world made possible by apis and the cloud alan and vonage want to take advantage of an opportunity that others have yet to do so “i think the biggest thing that’s lacking in the ucaas industry is the opportunity it’s the opportunity to marry employee communications like traditional ucaas approach with customer communications – which is sort of now the cpaas approach” alan explained “previously they were different islands of technology now you’ve normalized all ip communications and cloud based and now you add the api and delivery of the communications functionality” bridging the islands previously everything was based on separate technologies and left on separate islands now as alan put it everything is normalized and we can take advantage of this technology to create bridges and a new experience we haven’t taken advantage of previously “it’s easy for uber for example to embed the communications functionality into their booking service” alan continued “these things are no longer islands they speak to one another so why in the world would you have your customer communications out there not integrated with your employee communications it just makes no sense” to break it down more simply he used an example of searching for plane tickets online if you are on the airline’s webpage looking up information and at some point come across an issue – question complaint some issue of sorts – currently you find the airline’s  number dial in and now have to start over from square one you are the same as every other customer calling in fresh and the agent has no previous information of your actions or information gathered online prior to the call “there’s no context as to why i’m calling” alan said “the future will be when i’m on that website and i have a problem i’ll hit click to call on that website – because that website will incorporate communications functionally which will be integrated in via the existing ivr’s in the ucaas solution – so it then goes to the appropriate call center agent then the information will dump directly into the crm solution in my view that’s the value chain of ucaas – that’s the promise of ucaas” with increased connectivity and less points of contact or hoops to jump through customers will experience a new level of connection to the services and providers they choose to utilize this layer of context applied with any support or customer service cases will allow for much greater help and a level of personalization that just is not possible currently vonage is looking to pull all of the pieces together from its existing robust network of calling functionality with the apis and functionality provided by nexmo for sms voice and everything else on the roadmap to create a new level of ucaas unlike anything else in the industry tracking the progress now in his second year as the ceo of vonage we thought it appropriate – and curious – to see how alan feels his time has been shaping up so far we felt his words explained it best “i think if you ask my mother i’m doing really really well i’m proud of what we have accomplished here by next year we expect business to exceed consumer it will be the larger piece of the business” alan said “we’ve seen our brand move from its roots as a residential brand to more a business brand i’m proud of the progress we’ve made we’ve done ton a work in a short period of time and i think we assembled the piece parts going back to now we have this seamless integration of that whole ucaas value chain from working with the customer back to the employee communication back to the workflow tools all being integrated i think that is a unique solution offering that leapfrogs the competition so i’m proud of progress we’ve made” to learn more about vonage and their offerings head over to our vonage business reviews page to see what

our strategic priorities we are off to a solid start in  consolidated revenue in the first quarter was  million a  yearoveryear increase and our eighth consecutive of yearoveryear consolidated revenue growth more important we have continued to execute on our plans to transform volumes into a market leading cloud communications company our strategy remains routed in continued investment in vonage business to drive faster and longterm growth and we are continuing to leverage our strategic assets strong brand and low cost global network along with strong cash flows from our consumer segment for  let me review our three strategic priorities in ucaas and ill follow later reviewing our priorities in cpaas our first priority in ucaas is to accelerate sales in the enterprise segment since the beginning of the year we have made very strong progress in enterprise having closed four ucaas deals which in aggregate represent more than  million in total contract value three of these four deals will each deliver more than  million in total contract value while ne deal would deliver greater than  million in total contract value our second priority is to build out our multichannel sales infrastructure to drive revenue growth we are ontrack to open sales offices in nine additional markets in  bringing our total to  markets by end of year of these nine new markets seven are on the west coast one in the midwest and one in the southeast we have already hired sales leadership in several of these markets and these leaders are actively building out their teams we are also seeing improvements in sales productivity across the board and kenny wyatt our new chief revenue officer has consolidated our ucaas and cpaas sales teams under his leadership to promote lead sharing in sales across teams our third priority is to meaningfully strengthen our customer value preposition by integrating ucaas and cpaas we are seeing significant improvements in our value preposition from this integration in fact our cpaas solutions are profoundly changing the conversations we have with the customers the conversations has moved well beyond simply cloudifying the pdx for contact center now we show customer how vonages solutions can drive better business outcomes its a powerful combination to integrate ucaas into other cloud based workplace tools like crm and productivity and then link this to direct engagement with customers through cpaas in fact this is what unified communications is all about and while its still the used cases are venomous and it is fundamentally separating us from the competition a great example of these benefits is the multimillion dollar deal we signed recently with medxm a leading provider of preventive healthcare technology and health risk assessments with  medical staff personal medxm uses advanced technology to drive improve patients outcomes medxm selected vonage because our communication solution is driving better business outcomes on their behalf they are deploying vonage premier integrated with their g suite which is their productivity suite as well as our advanced context center powered by indiscernible but most important to our win is that medxm will our cpaas platform to better engage with their medical staff and patients by automatically sending appointment reminders connecting a medxm member seeking urgent care with nearby physician in real time or with other solution that connect doctors and patients now with that as a backdrop let’s review our first quarter results in more detail total vonage business q revenue was  million a  yearoveryear increase this quarter also proved out that large enterprise are seeing vonage as their go to partner to enable their move to cloud communication so as i mentioned we signed a deal with a total contract value of greater than  million in revenue this customer is the largest residential real estate company in united states they own and operate the best known residential real estate brands in the market we are contracted to deploy our vonage premier ucaas suite across  company owned location to at least  corporate seats in addition we are partnering with their corporate franchise team to offer vonage service to their  franchise offices in the united states vonage was selected for our mobile solution our video conferencing and collaboration tools and integration with sales force in office  these services will be delivered with full qos over vonages nationwide mpls network as well as through our smartwan solution the ability to provide qos coupled with real time reporting and analytics with critical to wining this our rfp and this was a highly competitive situation that included virtually all of the leading ucaas and telco organizations as well as detailed and lengthy pilot process these large multi million deals are complex and they take and significant time and corporate resources to close and deploy but they carry significant contract and life time value im very proud of our team for this win other significant ucaas wins include one of the largest radio broadcasting companies in us with more than  owned stations across the country and a large publically traded restaurant chain with more than  locations and for this restaurant chain cpaas was absolutely key to our win finally we continue to make progress on our strategic relationship with amazon we are already using amazon chime pro as a lead generator for sales of vonage essentials to larger customers versus its traditional focus on the micro customer segment and we continue to work towards the q launch of amazons web properties as distribution channels for vonage essentials our products will be sold across amazoncombusiness and the aws marketplace now lets turn to next move the vonage api platform where the teams delivered strong results in q vonage api platform revenues were  million a  yearoveryear pro forma interest during the quarter we saw solid traction with our new voice api and we made excellent progress against our three key cpaas initiatives the first initiative was the build developer awareness and we made solid progress building out this awareness our developer count increased  during the quarter we now stand at  registered developers and our growth has accelerated each quarter for four consecutive quarters we are registering developers from all over the world and from companies large and small spanning virtually every industry and vertical this strong developer growth is critical to further developing the long tail revenue opportunity our second key initiative is to expand the footprint and reach of our cpaas sales force we have meaningfully increased the size of our cpaas sales force worldwide and in particular we have added more sales people with voice expertise we have also begun to efficiently use our  ucaas sales people to generate leads for their cpaas colleagues later this year we expect our ucaas sales force to begin selling cpaas products serving as a significant force multiplier to our cpaas sales teams and while its still early results have been strong our us sales pipeline have increased significantly and first quarter us based revenue increased  from the prior year during the quarter we also won some notable new accounts we won lift the second largest ride sharing service in us lift selected vonage to power real time sms communications this was a competitive takeaway win and our sms api enables lift’s more than  drivers to provide faster update and the ability for drivers and passengers to text each other without sharing personal phone numbers we also won get which is europes number one ride sharing and mobility service get selected nexmo powered voice communications for the mobile application and we won their voice business from an established competitor because of our network quality we continue to benefit from the massive growth of the ride sharing industry as we now have relationships with lift  get uber and others as they all seek better communications solutions to connect with their customers also in the quarter we expanded our partnership with the zoho by integrating nexmo voice apis into the zoho crm platform users can make phone calls within the zoho crm send customized voice calls through crm workflows or set ivrs for outgoing and incoming calls and finally we just last week we went live with connectivity to microsoft flow and its automation suite this opens up a large opportunity for developers to embed communications into applications built on microsoft infrastructure including office  and azure customer base our third initiative was to meaningfully adds the utility and usability of our cpaas and we have added features to our number insight api to provide the full caller name for a person or business and a major us bank selected us for many use cases including the ability to update their crm database by validating the caller’s name and phone number we also added  carriers to our sms network and  carriers to our international voice network in april we added to our strong relationship with amazon web services by integrating our api platform with lex amazons artificial intelligent service that powers amazon alexa this integration gives developers an easy way to build custom bots driven by natural language understanding and to deliver those solutions through phone text app or mobile device so in closing im really pleased with our results and im encouraged by our progress in only three years we have built the largest revenue base in business cloud communications and we have created a unique value proposition from the integration of ucaas and cpaas we have demonstrated the power of our brand to efficiently move from its roots in residential to a leadership position in business and now we demonstrated the power of our products and our service delivery and our network infrastructure to win large enterprise customers across both ucaas and cpaas we have a clear strategy to become the differentiated leader in business cloud communications by using communication to deliver better business outcomes for our customer  far beyond simply cloudifying the pbx or contacts center we are fundamentally delivering those better business outcomes thank you and now im going to turn the call over to dave to review our financial performance in more and we will take questions at the end david pearson thanks alan and good morning everyone im pleased to review our financial results for the first quarter of  as in the past quarterly growth rates reflected in our presentation slides during our prepared remarks are on a yearoveryear basis unless otherwise noted as sequential with that lets begin on slide  consolidated revenue for the first quarter was  million up  million or  due to organic business growth of our ucaas business and the addition and subsequent growth of nexmo business represented  of total revenue moving to slide  let me now turn to our segment financial results for the first quarter starting with vonage business which consist of our ucaas and cpaas products vonage business total revenue was  million a  increase of this ucaas was  million and cpaas was  million cpaas continues to built momentum as we saw strong april revenue that we believe will result in q cpaas yearoveryear growth in the  area as alan noted our strategy is to maximize the reach and growth of our business segment by selling in portfolio of ucaas and cpaas products through a common set of sales channels we have a diverse group of business customers and low concentration risk with no one customer accounting for more than  of total business revenue business service revenue which includes all ucaas and cpaas revenue grew  to  million service margin during the first quarter was  down from  due to addition of nexmo first quarter average ucaas revenue per seat was  relatively flat versus  in a quarter a yearago revenue churn was  up from  in the year ago quarters and flat sequentially vonage business grew total seats to  up  reflecting strong organic growth before moving on to the consumer segment i would like to discuss a small divestiture last week we signed a definitive agreement to sell our hosted infrastructure services business to rapid scale a national managed services provider this business consists of a mixed portfolio of products including infrastructure as a service virtual desktop hosted microsoft exchange and other managed services we acquired this portfolio with the icore acquisition and operating this business for the last year and a half determined it is not core to our strategy of becoming the differentiated leader in business cloud communications we believe this is the right move for vonage and the customers of these services that they will be transitioning to an at scale focused posted services provider we expect to close this transaction at the end of may and anticipate a  million impact in the remainder of  a table showing revenue from the hosted infrastructure business over the last five quarters appears on slide  we have also included in his table onetime items we have referenced over the past five quarters which along with the hosted infrastructure numbers facilitates pro forma analysis total consumer revenue for the first quarter was  million down  consistent with our plans to increase investments in business as we continue to optimize consumer cash flows consumer service margin for the first quarter was  flat from the prior year reflecting our ability to hold margins stable despite a declining top line this feeds to the power of our common scale network infrastructure that serves both our consumer and business segments consumer customer churn was  consistent flat sequentially and yearoveryear we are seeing early signs of churn and cost per add improvements as we focus our consumer marketing efforts solely on digital and inbound telesales consumer average revenue per line in the first quarter was  down from  yearoveryear primarily due to lower usf which is a passthrough arpu was flat sequentially again demonstrating the quality of our tenured customers that they become a greater percentage of the installed base we ended the quarter with  million consumer subscriber lines as planned now moving to income statement cost items consolidated sales and marketing expense for the first quarter was  million up from  million reflecting a significant investments in the sales force headcount across all sales channels offset by the much more efficient and lower allocated media spend in consumer general and administrative expense for the first quarter was  million up from  million reflecting an addition of nexmo ga and acquisitions related costs in the form of vesting deal consideration pay to nexmo’s senior management turning ahead to slide  first quarter adjusted oibda was  million down  million the decrease in adjusted oibda is primarily due to investment to accelerate product development and sales infrastructure in cpaas and we plan to continue to invest at this pace if we continue to see the advantageous market conditions and opportunity we see today adjusted net income for the quarter was  million or  per share up  million adjusted net income benefited from a mandated accounting change that resulted in  million net tax benefit the adjusted net income metric removes noncash items such as amortization of intangibles from acquired companies and other acquisition related items we also recorded an adjustment to income taxes related to these exclusions moving to slide  capex for the quarter including the acquisition and development  assets was  million down from  million in the prior year given that last year we were executing a major data center consolidation that is now complete adjusted oibda minus capital expenditures was  million down  million highlighting the strong cash flow generation of our business precash flow which we defined it net cash provided by operating activities by in this capital expenditures and acquisition and development of software assets is  million up  million due to the lower capex spend we continue to use our strong cash flow generation to return value to shareholder through opportunistic share repurchases in the first quarter we bought back  million of stock or  million shares at an average price of  per share since beginning the repurchase of stock in august  we have bought back  million shares of vonage stock for  million at the highly accretive average price of  more over our share count is lower now than it was from the program started meaning that we more than offset five years of employee share issuance and four acquisitions that included the issuance stock our buyback continues to be one of the components of our capital allocation plan to be deployed at managements discretion cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of march  were  million including  million in restricted cash net debt was  million and we ended the quarter with net debt to trailing adjusted oibda of two times in addition to the significant repurchase of stock the first quarter is our heaviest indiscernible as we pay our cash bonuses in february the liquidity and strategy flexibility remain high through the  million credit facility we put in place in mid  with regarded ebit guidance were adjusting our revenue expectations only to reflect the impact of the hosted infrastructure services’ divestiture we now expect  business revenue which includes both ucaas and cpaas to be in the range of  million to  million corresponding total revenue guidance likewise adjusted to between  million and  million also these numbers mathematically removed from prior guidance approximately  million of anticipated revenue from the divested hosted infrastructure business for the period from june through december that concludes my prepared remarks ill now turn the call over to hunter to initiate the qa hunter blankenbaker okay great thank you dave and victoria lets please turn it over to the qa session questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions the first question is from george sutton of craighallum your line is open george sutton thank you congratulations on the four large deals im trying to understand you have given your somewhat unusual and that you have a large direct sales force and use the channel where are these deals coming from the perspective of the customer segment alan masarek thanks george can we have joe answer that joseph redling yes hey george its a mix i think the large deal alan referred to really came from a consultant process where these large companies actually have consultant that help them with the rfps so that was kind of directly came out of our enterprise group and direct filed sales our direct selling efforts others came from the channel so its a mix so we are seeing a lot of traction throughout both our direct sales efforts and indirect george sutton super on the bright sharing side a very interesting that you picked up lift very interesting that you picked up get obviously indiscernible has had some issues with their relationship with uber i know they are a customer of yours as well can you talk about any changes there and what is causing you to be so successful in that specific category alan masarek i think our success in the category is not unique they are just highprofile customers we are seeing success across a variety of categories they happen to be big users of cpaas types of solutions obviously big wins with lift and get ongoing relationships with uber and several others that we are beginning to see the green shoots of how it expands to greater number of those countries and then adding voice to what we did in the past with sms but the nice thing is we still sit with virtually no customer concentration issues as it relates to these ride sharing companies or anyone else george sutton super thanks guys operator thank you the next question is from of dmitry netis of william blair your line is open dmitry netis just a couple of clarification on the financial side of things then more of a broader shareholder questions just on your business on the oibda you came in pretty much in line with last quarter i didn’t hear you talked about what it will look like for the year i think the last time you said at least  million so im just curious if you are reiterating that guide or not and then it does imply pretty steep ramp in the second half of the year given you did  in march how are you thinking about that ramp i would suppose that that also implies you will be breakeven in your ucaas business so whether that’s on track or not also i would like you comment on that thank you david pearson sure thanks to dmitry the only change in guidance is the math of seeking the hosted infrastructure business and the impact that has on business revenue and corresponding total revenue i think its too early in the year to address the other aspects of guidance whether its oibda or anything outside of the hosted infrastructure services clearly the  million which we also did last quarter is based on heavy investment in both ucaas and cpaas and i said in my comments that if we continue to see the market conditions and the opportunity that we are seeing on cpaas are going to be very hard on the indiscernible so we saw it that way for the rest of the year there continue to be a drag on oibda but that’s really about what we are seeing and how quickly we make these investments in new products and new sales infrastructure and how that moves through the year dmitry netis okay great and then i was wondering if you can comment on the ucaas side alan as far as last quarter you were talking about the bookings growth in ad business being  above kind of the full year revenue guidance you gave is that still on track are you feeling incrementally more bullish now that you landed you before the deal last time you were above by a   basis points is it still the case or is it better now given these deals alan masarek thanks to meet you so we are feeling increasingly confident about the bookings growth through the year and how that has the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth really next year the macro point as we talk about a lot is that we have built so much of this infrastructure whether its sales infrastructure geographically or number of sales people relationship with channel partners and now most recently even levered distribution models with amazon an such that wont kick in to the second half of the year those are taking foot and you see those with these big deals that we have signed that take a long time to one secure and then two deploy but all those are demonstrating the green shoots that are propelling us as we go through the year and that’s why we are increasingly bullish about our performance just based on those examples that i and dave cited in our prepared comments dmitry netis okay very well and i guess i heard you say on the big deals there was multimillion dollar contract value do you mind restating what that life science contract value is and im not sure i got that alan masarek we said of the four large deals one was greater than  million in tcv and the other three were greater than  million so they were each seven figures and the one large deal was eight figures in aggregate those four deals represent more than  million in total contract value revenues dmitry netis very well very well if i could squeeze one last one here on amazon with this the indiscernible advertising earlier in this year in the march timeframe of your sort of chime vonage relationship there it does look like the product isn’t ready yet given indiscernible late q launch so just wondering is that kind of in anticipation you are just building the brand related with to this partnership and once the product is available you are going to hit the ground line how you feel about kind of where you are in your ability to sell and bundle a chime and whether you also wait kind of the amazon side of things when they are ready to kind of put that on their portal and kind of hit the ground line so i guess you are approaching it from both sides of the point here but which one will be kind of faster to get to market are going to come out about the same time just a little bit of color on how you go to market once the product kind of launches in late q alan masarek right so as you stated in your question there are two sides to this transaction with this relationship with amazon one is our access to the product to amazon chime and amazon chime pro we have that now and we are using that for lead generation two larger customers than what we typically sold vonage essentials into that’s already happening and thats the advertising campaign you have seen on television by the end of this quarter by the end of q the ability to deploy that ever more seamlessly will be done on the product side on the distribution side of the relationship where amazon will actually be selling vonage essentials on their web properties which is amazoncombusiness and the aws marketplace that will happen in q you have to remember there is two sides of this dmitry netis okay thank you alan thank you gentlemen operator thank you operator instructions the next question is from rich valera of needham  company your line is open richard valera thank you i was hoping you could provide a little more color on the acceleration you are seeing in the cpaas business going into q kind of what is driving that is it indiscernible any particular kind of verticals or any color you could give there would be helpful thanks david pearson yes it goes back to the comments that alan made about ride sharing as well as voice and those are the areas of strong  however just seen it across the complex of customers set so if you have not been disproportionate but those are the two strongest areas think as we go through the year we expect that voice will be a greater and greater percentage of the growth and that is a different that we saw in april and relative to earlier in the year alan masarek hey rich this is alan i have a point on that the game plan to accelerate cpaas is just a few key initiatives one you want to build the long tail and so i commented on the growth in registered developers which now has doubled since we announced the deal that’s an important element the other then is expanding the sales force itself for cpaas which we have done in a worldwide basis and concurrent with that use the ucaas sales force which is  strong think of them as a force multiplier for the cpaas sales force on top of those two you add a whole new product category voice and really a whole new geography of the united states we are executing on each of those elements so its across the board which is driving that acceleration richard valera got it and just one more question if i could just on the sort of synergy between the ucaas and cpaas medxm seems like a great sort of testament to that potential just wondering if you could give us any sense kind of indiscernible those types of deals you see out there to potentially sell both sides of the product portfolio there alan masarek i will tell you that in every one of our customer discussions the fact that we can provide these better business outcomes via cpaas is profoundly changing that conversation with the customer in the final days of reporting closed medxm i was having direct conversations with their ceo specifically about cpaas use cases in terms of how it drives better business outcomes for now in every one of those situations large deals and vast majority of mid size and many small deals we are going against a competitor in the core ucaas side what is wining the day is obviously having excellence in ucaas solution but what is separating from the pack is these only to communicate a cpaas solution which again is there to drive the better business outcomes we have grown up in ucaas during the last several years thinking that ucaas is synonymous with cloudifying the pbx in the contact center its much much more than that it’s about using communications to embed into those workflow apps business processes mobile apps and alike to get better business outcomes and there is example after examples where its work indiscernible richard valera got it thanks for that color alan operator thank you the next question is from catharine trebnick of dougherty your line is open catharine trebnick thanks for taking my question alan and david either one of you it doesn’t seem like your heavy emphasis on cpaas congratulations but quick question on ucaas are you reaffirming your  yearoveryear growth rate because it looks like you are taking  million out of end the year and can you give some color around what you expect the ucaas growth rate to be it sounds like you have some good opportunities i just like to tweak my model thank you david pearson sure your guidance is only changing by the  million that we would have gotten from the hosted infrastructure business from june  through december  so its literally just math the rest of our guidance remains the same the guidance that we on ucaas was a midteens growth rate and that continues to be the pro forma growth rate that we expect to see catharine trebnick alright and quick question any color on the difference of how well are the smb segment is doing compared to large enterprise just between essentials and premier approximately is it essential  on a revenue basis and then which group do you think is really growing faster david pearson that continues to be the split essentials continues to be a bit bigger low to mids with premier being the compliment i think we commented before on the fact that the growth rate in the lower end of the market is still attractive when its been slowing we are executing a buildout of this portfolio and infrastructure to be very strong player up market i think we continue to be a bit less mature than some of our competitors there so we are not yet capturing all of the growth in the up market but the investments that we are making we expect well fully do that and that represents the bookings growth and ultimately the revenue growth that we expect to see that alan commented on catharine trebnick alight thanks gentlemen operator thank you the next question is from greg burns of sidoti  company your line is open gregory burns hey good morning i just want to get a little bit of clarification on the customer concentration on the business segment if we look at the cpaas individually on its own do you have any customer concentration within that revenue base and when you look at your customers how much revenue or how many customers do you think have the wherewithal to do what an uber is doing still a multi sourcing cpaas offerings how much revenue do you have that could potentially be at risk for something like that thank you alan masarek greg let me ask dave to take the first part on customer concentration cpaas and ill take the second david pearson yes as i mentioned in my prepared remarks the way we think about concentration is as a whole and we talked about having our largest customer in the business complex be roughly  of revenue that is a ucaas customer as it relates to the whole just to give you a sense of size our single largest cpaas customer represents  of our business revenue and so obviously if you look just at cpaas its slightly higher percent but still singledigits and not high singledigits so we feel very good about that and the fact that we are not exposed just to give you a sense if you thought about our top  cpaas customers today uber is not one of our top  cpaas customers just to comment on that specific exposure and not specific opportunity alan masarek and greg relative to you question about how many customers can as you said sort of pull an uber and do this in a multisource dynamic trading way the answer is that there are probably a couple of dozen that we see out there that act in that way where they want to move traffic countrybycountry or modebymode so tax versus voice but the key thing to think about is the to win in cpaas is not predicated on an uber airbnb and snap whatsapp is very very large initial users of cpaas the key to winning is to build a very long tail because having thousands of customers with a few thousand dollars a months of sales is better than having a handful of these multimillion dollar customers who have the ability to as u say pull an uber and run this like a dynamic trading environment where they have got great price sensitivity and they move traffic largely based upon price so you have got to build this business on both ends of the tail the long tail and doing smart value added things with these enterprise customers and that’s exactly what we are trying to execute on gregory burns okay great thank you operator thank you and the next question is from mike latimore of northland your line is open mike latimore congratulations on those enterprise wins how many enterprise or seven figures deals did you have in all of  just for comparison sake alan masarek well then i have to look at the number i don’t know exactly the number of time again what we are seeing just as dave said our ability in enterprise is increasing dramatically again take a step back we started with vonage essentials the former indiscernible going after the micro segment  year ago then beginning just a little over two years ago we acquired through the acquisitions of telesphere followed simple signal and icore the ability to serve the up market a business both mid market and now large enterprise and we have been building the infrastructure sales service delivery network and so on in order to deliver that the companies that we acquired each had large businesses in there large enterprise customers within their stable and those continues to today we now in the new vonage where we provide this we brought all the pieces together and added a great deal of resources are now hitting our stride where we have again knocked down since the beginning of the year these four very large deals with a very healthy pipeline of more to come mike latimore great and then in term of the cpaas you talked about cpaas acceleration and the highlighted voice a few times there i mean as you look at the revenue composition or bookings composition of cpaas how important is voice is it going to be singledigit percent of revenue in bookings or how should we think about the voice just generally on the cpaas line alan masarek so voice is very important to that growth in cpaas so if you recall last year nexmo did  million in revenue within that revenue  was sms only  was voice and  of its traffic terminated outside the united states so as i said before in earlier question the game plan for growth is to build the long tail and build the sales force while currently adding voice as meaningful element of the mix and then extending to the united states as a region that really was underserved by nexmo because its focus was outside the united states that’s what we are executing on the beauty about voice in the united states for us is that by paring nexmo’s the programmable that api layer what we call vapi the voice api with our network in the us we know empirically we can deliver higher voice quality than our competitors and because we have the direct peering relationships with the carriers in the united states again goes back to the power of the residential business with those  billion minutes of calls that we terminate annually and the fact we own our own phone numbers we can do voice in the united states at very very high margins so the opportunity for us to grow the top line and grow the bottom line has a lot to do with how we build voice in the united states mike latimore great thanks operator and the next question is from william power of baird your line is open william power congratulations on the realestate i wonder if you can just kind of walk us through you talked about thats being a very competitive process looking back what were some of the key differentiators that helped you win that and then im just curious if there are any cpaas opportunities in that way joseph redling so ill take the first part of it will so yes it was a very involved process i think it was a  providers early on in the process and lot of the competitors fell out very quickly what you see the advantages we bring to the table is really qls right i think when you get to this level of enterprise the level of slas that are required at are stringent and you havetohave the capability in your infrastructure and your network with qls its one particular deal and as alan pointed out literally includes both our npls network and smart lan so qls was a key driver as well as the ability to scale this many locations with this type of deployment its very complex the third piece was really reporting and analytics right these are very sophisticated companies so we expect at a high level of monitoring and a proactive approach for after sales so i think when you add those things together we were in a very good position to drive this sale so those are the three key components alan masarek let me ask tony to jump in on the cpaas side because there is active discussions underway right now on extending cpaas solutions into this customer antoine jamous yes thanks alan so in the reader space segment in general we see interesting potential for cpaas because you should of it you have the customer and the agent communication and you have the agent and the headquarter communication and a lot of these companies they need to transform to become more software companies they need to add more agility and they don’t need this facilities to buy pure software here but they want to integrate the software they want to build they want to actually control it and this where we see the opportunity cpaas is enabling these companies to transform themselves and improve the customer experience and agent experience in the real estate william power okay thank you let me extend and i guess the second question you look at use of cash from here buy bought back  million of stock how should we think about appetite for buying back more stock versus looking on additional ma and i guess just generally speaking how you think about your appetite for further ma probably i assume on the ucaas side but how do you look at that joseph redling yes so we are right on pace actually it’s a little bit of ahead of pace on our  million four year authorization and we intend to fulfill that authorization we have got seven quarters left to go on that and given the history and the liquidity we expect to finish that out as it relates to ma and just being generally flexible i would say that is our highest financial priority very strategically flexible we continue to see small and medium size rollout type opportunities and those are getting more attractive over time in terms of price i think we are just trying to balance that against potential industry consolidation where we believe we have a pretty interesting competitive advantage because of our size and because of our balance sheet and because of our cash flow generation so being flexible for the right opportunity there within ma is our highest priority and then secondarily would be a continuation of smaller consolidation or rollout opportunities william power may be if i could just sneak one more in just a followup for tony i know there has been some questions and probably some concern just with respect to cpaas competition what might be evolving on that front and i mean your number suggest these obvious price otherwise you are seeing good traction i wonder if you could just speak to what you are seeing your competitively has there been any sea change events are you seeing more players in the market place just any further color there would be helpful antoine jamous sure so we see more players branding themselves as cpaas that’s when you look it deeper we don’t have any concern as you because as you recall a cpaas it is more than just api it’s a full platform that comes with a developer tool with algorithm that manages all the other network and higher level of enterprise capabilities that takes years to develop so we see increasing need of indiscernible which is a great traction for our category but we don’t see any concerns about a major competition entering in the market at this stage william power okay thank you operator thank you and the next question is from robert routh fbn securities your line is open robert routh yes good morning and thanks for taking my questions first i was curious if you could give us an update as to your tax nols what the size of them is and what you think you might do with them especially given talk about them changing corporate tax rate indiscernible federal tax nols it would seem that may be finding any company that generates real  lot of operating income now and being offset their future income with your nols before the laws change might make a lot of sense im wondering if you could talk a little about how you think about that david pearson sure current tax intervals is  million so its sizable and it’s a strategic asset for us we do believe that we are consuming it and we expect to fully consume it over the coming years particularly as we generate significant amount of allocated cash flow from the consumer business so we are definitely open to different ideas and clearly we are tracking very closely any changes in the tax rate but right now we continue to consume it at whatever the rate is given the cash flow generation that’s going to happen in due course robert routh and just one followup given your success now with the lift and obviously you have get and the uber relationship what would your dream industry or your client be if you don’t mind mentioning in terms of areas where you are not yet that you think that given your size now and what you done in any kind of the endorsements you have had that you would like to be and is there any industry that you don’t yet have a presence in or any particular where you think it would just be vonage’s dream client to win alan masarek let me turn it over to tony to answer this comment ahead of time and the way to think about cpaas is its where can communications are make an underlying business process or an app or a website just that and its everywhere its a simple answer but ill let tony answer about if there is a dream industry antoine jamous yes there is only the a dream industry but potentially this market has started by early adopters and these were the light house account that we talk about often the uber airbnb snapchat of the world but what we see in an acceleration of the recorded early majority these are agile enterprises that wanted to sort of transform themselves to become more software company and they want to do that to improve the user experience between differentiated user experience and created new markets so the industry that we would like to grow more into are the industry that are mostly affected by the digital transformation i think about retail being disrupted by amazon i think about transportation being disrupted by uber but think about even financial services are being disrupted by new indiscernible lending companies so these are the segments that we would like to penetrate more and see more acceleration of this early majority adopting cpaas for two reasons one is because each one of the enterprises there is a lot of use cases in them so when you enter that enterprise you can help multiple departments and secondly is because as alan mentioned one of our objective is to build a long tail and we want increasingly customers that are spending that are spending a significant amount of revenue but compared to their overall size it is a real activity and a small spend thats kind of where we focus on and new hope that that early majority segment accelerates the adoption as we move forward robert routh okay great thank you very much operator thank you and at this time i would like to hand the call back over back to hunter for closing remarks hunter blankenbaker great
