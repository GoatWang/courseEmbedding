connects the intelligent remote radio heads with the virtualized compute nodes over any transport it could be dark fiber lit fiber wdm fttx carrier ethernet microwave mmwave or anything else you have whatever transport is economically and readily available you can use it that means you don’t have to restrict yourself to small pockets of your network to run limited scale cran experiments anymore don’t settle for coordinated ran or whatever your incumbent vendors call it deploy a full scale cran on all parts of your network with our innovative vran solution carriergrade nfv platform ran infrastructure is your most vital asset therefore when virtualizing the ran functions a carrier grade platform that can provide high availability ultra low latency massive scalability and ease of maintenance is essential that’s exactly what we have done we have taken a carrier grade nfv platform that is built on open source enhanced it with carrier grade requirements and implemented the software modules of the enodeb in vnfs called vbbu with this solution you will deploy a ran solution that is more robust than your current ran infrastructure with automatic failover in seconds live migrations and geographic redundancy to handle any situations application intelligence data consumption is on the rise driven by increasingly powerful smartphones plethora of applications and favorable data subscription plans gone are the days when a subscriber will remain loyal to your network due to subscription contracts moreover the spectrum required to support such increase in consumption isn’t readily available in this dynamic environment you need to deploy intelligent enodebs that understand applications and application states to intelligently schedule ip packets over the air the intelligent enodeb will not only improve capacity of your ran but also will improve user’s quality of experience for this you need a softwareintensive vran solution capacity  performance gain with ltea lte advanced is essential in increasing the spectral efficiency of the lte systems to implement lte advanced features such as comp and carrier aggregation you need to deploy a ran solution that can provide necessary coordination across multiple radio heads our vran solution provides such capability for both intra site and inter site scenarios that means you don’t have to settle for solutions that can only provide lte advances benefits across sectors of a single site with our vran solution you can improve capacity and performance across x area of your ran coverage compared to solutions handicapped intra site only coordination capability leap towards g the vran solution is the step towards realization of g vision software programmability of bearers as per use case is required to create g network slices  moreover requirements such as ultra low latency data path can be achieved with intelligent offload of selected bearers right at the radio head these are possible with vran today internet of things and the use cases of various iot verticals will require massive scalability in the control plane this requirement alone will necessitate use of web scale hardware and software platforms for the ran which is what vran provides better video streaming experience the application intelligence in altiostar’s vran solution detects user’s streaming video flows over default bearer and adapts them to the instantaneous radio conditions with integrated content caching the quality of the video delivered to the user can be the highest possible resolution since the flow is not contending for bandwidth in many hops between the video streaming server and the enodeb the application intelligence engine in the vran adapts accelerates transport connection setup prioritizes shapes every video streaming flow that match the treatment criteria the result is stunning video quality without stalls delivered to the users at a lower cost connecting people with video calls nothing will delight your users more than the freedom to make and receive crystal clear video calls tofrom their near and dear ones today in majority of the networks the ims video calling and ott video calling applications such as facetime googletalk skype are limited to wifi access only altiostar’s vran solution is designed to adapt conversational video flows in tune with the
