by the reporting entities meridians prior filings have focused on the what and when elements of the securities reporting and corporate governance problems involving cyanotech  this filing will focus on the who and why elements with particular focus on the involvement of the rudolph steiner foundation background on may   meridian delivered a letter to cyanotechs board of directors detailing extensive reporting and governance issues involving cyanotechs chairman and largest shareholder michael davis and its second largest shareholder the rudolph steiner foundation  after delivering the may  letter meridian sought to discuss its contents with cyanotechs board of directors and when it became clear that cyanotechs board was unwilling to engage in any discussions meridian filed a lawsuit in federal court on may   as detailed in its october   schedule d filing meridian believes davis has created an undisclosed group with the rudolph steiner foundation in order that davis and rsf might control the board of directors of cyanotech and thereby control the companys business  while the facts speak for themselves with respect to davis activities in creating a group with rsf there has remained the question as to why davis and rsf have taken their unusual actions  this filing explores the question of motivations for both davis and rsf  whenever possible this filing provides direct quotations from available public materials in order to make clear that meridian is providing information that is both accurate and fair rudolph steiner foundation dba rsf social finance rudolph steiner foundation rsf is a selfdescribed sociallyresponsible investment organization that seeks to revolutionize how people relate to money by transforming what it means to earn a return   on its website rsf informs that it seeks to redirect the flow of money in local markets and heal an economy often damaged by exploitation and resource depletion  rsf takes its name and purpose from the work of rudolph steiner a germanaustrian philosopher and social reformer who died in   steiner founded an esoteric spiritual movement called anthroposophy which includes teaching in the areas of education artistic expression medicine and agriculture  steiners ideas included a concept of spiritual science involving clairvoyant experiences and the belief that individuals are reincarnated in a variety of different peoples and races over successive lives most relevant to cyanotech are rsfs beliefs concerning the practice of agriculture according to the biodynamic association bda an organization created in  that awakens and enlivens cocreative relationships between humans and the earth rudolph steiner was the founder of the biodynamic approach to agriculture  according to bda steiner came to the conclusion that western civilization would gradually bring destruction to itself and the earth if it did not begin to develop an understanding of the spiritual world and its interrelationship with the physical world steiner is credited as being the first to bring the perspective of the farm as a single selfsustaining organism that thrives through biodiversity steiner developed a unique and comprehensive approach to soil plant animal and human health that recognizes the importance of the healthy interplay of cosmic and earthly influences with this knowledge he developed a set of homeopathic preparations…that help build up the farms innate immune system and vital forces rsfs investment activities from information on its website it appears the focus of rsfs investment activities is providing capital to support food initiatives  rsf reports that many of the entities it funds are biodynamic or sympathetic to bd melding ethical and spiritual ideas with practical farming and sustainability goals  rsf also explains on its website that all of our philanthropic investment options are return agnostic and do not seek marketrate returns as a primary goal   consistent with its mission aligned investment approach rsf announced in  that in response to the indirect opaque impersonal and volatile nature of the stock market rsf divested from all public equities and redirected capital to investments more closely aligned with its values  in  in partnership with leslie christian of portfolio  investments rsf published a white paper entitled a new foundation for portfolio management that rsf says challenges traditional notions of portfolio theory and investment management  stating that its own investment approach is grounded in the understanding that economic growth cannot be infinite on a planet with finite natural resources rsfs white paper argues that the possibility of longterm continuous zero or negative economic growth precipitated by ecological limits warrants deeper consideration for longterm investment portfolios  rsfs white paper concludes with the objective that rsf serve as an example for other investors who want to engage in whole portfolio activation where  of a portfolio is aligned with mission  this mission includes decoupling from wall street as much as possible rsfs investment in cyanotech rsf became a shareholder of cyanotech in  and has reported in its schedule g filings that it currently owns  of the companys outstanding shares  because rsfs filings related to cyanotech are the only sec ownership filings rsf has ever made it appears that cyanotech is the only public company in which rsf has ever held an ownership stake greater than  in studying rsfs investment in cyanotech we note that i rsf became a shareholder in  the same year it reported that it was divesting of all of its public company holdings and ii rsf executed what for it was an extraordinary international privatelynegotiated purchase of a  block of cyanotech shares taking rsfs holdings above  and requiring rsf to file the only g it has ever filed in  the same year it published its investment white paper describing its intention of decoupling from wall street as much as possible given rsfs strong interest in agriculture and in particular its desire to meld ethical and spiritual ideas with practical farming and sustainability goals meridian believes that its participation with davis in controlling cyanotech has become a part of rsfs goal to transform society by causing cyanotech to operate consistent with rsfs spiritual science and growthrelated philosophies the group controlling cyanotech in its previous filings meridian has focused on the what and when elements of the group that has been created by rsf and michael davis  after researching rsfs public statements of principles and purpose meridian believes it can now begin to understand the who and why elements of the actions it has observed taken by cyanotechs control group as discussed in meridians may   schedule d filing it is wellknown to those around cyanotech that michael davis has a very close relationship with rsf  according to the companys previous ceo davis took the executive to visit rsfs offices on his very first day on the job with cyanotech  davis has now confirmed that every single share of cyanotech stock held by rsf was acquired with the direct participation of davis either as a gift of shares from a daviscontrolled entity or as a gift of cash to be used to acquire cyanotech shares having now studied the philosophy and investment strategy of rsf meridian believes it has a more complete understanding of what davis and rsf have been seeking to accomplish with their control group at cyanotech  this understanding helps to explain some of the unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at cyanotech  recall first these elements of rsfs investment strategy · decoupling from wall street as much as possible · do not seek marketrate returns as a primary goal · the possibility of longterm continuous zero or negative economic growth precipitated by ecological limits next consider the following unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at cyanotech · the company conducts no investor relations – there are no investor calls no investor roadshows there is not even a powerpoint designed to introduce investors to the company · the company provides minimal disclosure in its quarterly sec filings and press releases following a template that discloses numeric data with very little commentary thus leaving outside investors without material information about the companys business drivers eg why is it taking so long for cyanotech to adapt its production methodologies in order to increase the amount of astaxanthin available for sale · the board of directors actively discourages management and employees from engaging with investors as an example as part of its standard practice meridian sent a representative to cyanotechs  annual meeting of shareholders  as part of this standard practice meridian contacted the company weeks in advance to inform the company of its planned visit and request an opportunity to meet with management and directors and if possible tour the companys facilities in hawaii  a company representative replied that cyanotech no longer provided tours and that meridian would be welcome at the shareholder meeting  yet cyanotechs board knowing that an investor had traveled thousands of miles to meet with company representatives immediately cleared the room following adjournment of the formal scripted shareholder meeting thus providing only minutes for the meetandgreet that is standard at every other small public shareholder meeting meridian has ever attended  it was only by the personal intervention of cyanotech founder gerry cysewski that any purpose was salvaged from the trip as he arranged for a short tour of cyanotechs farm · cyanotechs last two ceos were generally wellregarded by the companys outside shareholders  both were terminated without explanation shortly after leading the company through periods of rapid and positive business development  both ceos saw their termination result in the loss of significant cash and equity incentives that had accrued during their tenure · after more than a year of cyantech disclosing difficulties in increasing astaxanthin production and subsequent research by meridian into the potential of investing in closedsystems that would protect the algae from environmental influences meridian twice approached the company offering to provide capital if that would help the company implement the necessary production changes  meridian received no response from these offers  instead meridian soon after learned that cyanotech had terminated the employment of the ceo that had communicated meridians offer to the board · in addition to his role as chairman of the board of directors davis is chairman of the boards nominating and governance committee  in this position davis has established a pattern of recruiting individuals to serve on cyanotechs board that have no prior public company board experience · the directors recruited by chairman davis have responded in a surprisingly passive manner to revelations that their chairman and largest shareholder has for years failed to make proper sec filings with respect to his holdings in cyanotech  after an independent investigation reported that certain facts relating to the relationship between the companys two largest shareholders davis and rsf could be consistent with the existence a group the boards reaction was to defer to davis urging him to consider whether or not a group exists · the directors recruited by chairman davis after having been publicly challenged concerning numerous public company corporate governance deficiencies including multiple apparent conflicts of interest reported to the companys outside shareholders that the board was aware of and is untroubled by such conflicts · at davis urging cyanotech recently replaced its honolulubased law firm goodsill anderson which describes itself as focused on the business needs of clients in hawaii and around the world with practice areas including securities law banking real estate tax and attorneys knowledgeable in such specialized areas as mergers and acquisitions environmental law antitrust aviation admiralty and international trade  the firm that replaced cyanotechs historic corporate counsel is a san franciscobased law firm farella braun that describes itself as trial lawyers first with experience including complex litigation involving class actions antitrust and unfair competition business litigation involving securities commodities and ma disputes  cyanotechs new corporate counsel had previously represented davis and his affiliated foundations and therefore was likely involved in davis gifts to rsf that resulted in rsfs large holdings in cyanotech  the firms website states we represent more than  philanthropic organizations from community private family and corporate foundations to charitable trusts and public charities and we have proven experience for tax efficient transfers of individual wealth to personal familial or corporate exempt organizations including the best and proper method to accept account for and plan to receive gifts of value including cash securities real estate art and other precious commodities conclusion in its prior filings meridian has focused on the actions of michael davis to create a group with rsf and to cause cyanotech to take actions that appear inconsistent with proper public company corporate government practices and the fiduciary obligations of cyanotechs board of directors  meridian believes it is important to understand why davis decided to collaborate with rsf  in this regard rsfs  white paper promoting a new investment approach that is  missionfocused on longterm investments where the possibility of longterm continuous zero or negative economic growth was acceptable appears to be central  that same year davis gave rsf  million to acquire the  block that would elevate rsfs ownership in cyanotech to  and the combined ownership of the davisrsf group to   it was also in that same year that davis became chairman of the board of directors of cyanotech meridian believes the control group of davis and rsf are responsible for the unusual business practices and strategic decisions observed at cyanotech  meridian believes these practices and decisions are preventing cyanotech from realizing its potential and were made to advance the interests and philosophical pursuits of davis and rsf not the best interests of cyanotechs outside stockholders     meridian is always interested in hearing from fellow stockholders and has created a special email address to help cyanotech stockholders

following supplements the information provided in prior schedule d filings by the reporting entities background on may   meridian delivered a letter to cyanotechs board of directors detailing extensive reporting and governance issues involving cyanotechs chairman and largest shareholder michael davis  after delivering the may  letter meridian sought to discuss its contents with cyanotechs board of directors and when it became clear that cyanotechs board was unwilling to engage in any discussions meridian filed a lawsuit in federal court on may    on june   cyanotech announced that it had engaged counsel to represent a special committee of the board that had been formed to investigate the issues raised in meridians may  letter  four months later cyanotech disclosed a summary of the special committees findings in a form k filing with the sec in this amendment to schedule d meridian will update and discuss the securities reporting issues raised in its may  letter  there have been three recent sec filings made by cyanotech or davis that have provided new information on these topics i form q filed by cyanotech on august   ii form k filed by cyanotech on september   iii schedule d filed by michael davis on september   these filings confirm that davis who himself owns  of cyanotechs stock caused the rudolph steiner foundation rsf to become the holder of another  bringing the combined ownership of the two shareholders to   while it is not illegal or even improper to become a large shareholder with substantial influence over the activities of a public company the securities and exchange act of  and sec rules promulgated thereunder require prompt and full disclosure of such facts the relevant sec rules begin with the requirement that any investor acquiring more than  of a public company make a filing with the sec within ten days  passive investors are allowed to use a short form schedule g while those who have the ability or intent to influence the company or anyone with  or more of the companys stock must file on schedule d  in addition anyone reaching the  level must report every transaction in the companys stock within two business days on form   finally even stricter requirements are placed on insiders and control entities of public companies this includes anyone who is a named executive officer or board member  such persons must report all transactions of any size and regardless of their ownership level on form  within two business days davis history of securities reporting deficiencies meridian discovered in  that michael davis has a long history of failing to make the required sec disclosures regarding his ownership of cyanotech stock  these deficiencies raise several issues  first until last month davis reported his cyanotech holdings on short form schedule g rather than the required schedule d  persons who have the ability to control public companies such as board members are not eligible to file on schedule g  davis has been on the cyanotech board of directors for  years since  and has been the boards chairman since   the special committee agreed that davis is required to file on schedule d second the special committee confirmed meridians allegation that davis did not even comply with the lesser schedule g reporting requirements according to the special committee mr davis made late schedule g filings in      and  and failed to file reports pursuant to section  in    and  third the filings davis did make contained misstatements and omissions  according to the special committee certain of davis prior reports in   and  also contained immaterial inaccuracies related to share totals beneficial ownership calculations or cotrustee names  meridian believes the special committees summary understates the problem  the following is only one example the last known transaction between michael davis and rsf involved davis donating  shares to rsf on  which was reported on a form  filed by davis on   this form  also reported that davis acquired  shares in open market purchases on   one month later on  davis made a schedule g filing  filers eligible to use schedule g are required to make annual reports of their yearend holdings within  days this means such filings are due on or before february  of each year  davis made his filing a month late but still purported to report his holdings as of the prior yearend   but this is not what his schedule g reported  on  davis filed a form  to report an equity grant of  shares and then on  filed a schedule g reporting his yearend  holdings as precisely  shares higher than reported in the schedule g filed on   this means that davis  schedule g reported his holdings after the transactions on  and  rather than his holdings as of the prior yearend on  thus in the case of this one filing we see that i davis filed on the wrong form schedule g rather than the required schedule d ii davis filed his schedule g a month late and iii davis misstated his holdings as of the date required for the filing and iv davis misstated his holdings as of the date he claimed within his filing  meridian does not believe davis compounding of errors was accidental or that such compounding of errors by a public companys chairman of the board who is also the companys largest shareholder can be considered immaterial fourth davis failed to make the required form  filings when he transferred shares to rsf in  and   davis did make the required form  filings with respect to his openmarket purchases of cyanotech shares during those years  this onesided reporting with respect to acquisitions but not all transfers out provides linkage to the next topic relating to davis sec reporting practices parking in its may  letter meridian observed that davis schedule g filings show two seemingly related patterns  first davis regularly shifted and moved his cyanotech shares among numerous entities  second he never allowed his reported holdings to go above   the additional disclosure by davis and cyanotech confirmed another pattern which is davis repeatedly donated shares to rsf when such gifts were necessary to keep his direct holdings below the  threshold starting around august  and ending around march  davis executed a series of openmarket purchases in which he accumulated more than  shares of cyanotech stock  davis first gift of shares to rsf occurred in  and therefore coincided with the beginning of davis buying activity  the next known gift occurred in february  and therefore coincided with the end of davis buying activity  davis last known gift to rsf of  shares on february   made it possible for davis to report on his subsequent schedule g that he had kept his ownership below the  threshold davis form  filing on february   is very interesting as it shows in a single filing both a transaction buying  shares that would have taken his ownership above  coinciding with a gift to rsf  shares that reduced his holdings sufficiently for davis to remain below the  threshold  the february   gift of  shares came just one day prior to davis february   open market purchase of  shares  according to the trading data available on nasdaqcom cyanotechs average trading volume for the ten trading days prior to davis february   purchase was only  shares  this suggests davis knew of an opportunity to make a large purchase and delayed that transaction until after he had reduced his holdings sufficiently via the gift of  shares to rsf to allow for the purchase without going above the  threshold nasdaq rules define parking as the illegal holding of stock by a third party or the financing of such a stock in which the third partys sole reason for holding the stock is to conceal ownership or control davis did not just transfer shares to rsf when necessary to keep his direct holdings below the  threshold he also financed rsf purchases  the recent filings confirm meridians allegations concerning davis involvement with rsfs acquisition of a  block of stock from vitaelab  davis acknowledged in his schedule d that when he learned of the existence of the  block he took that information to rsf  davis also disclosed that in or about the same time he provided rsf with the funds rsf used to acquire the  block davis has for years been causing rsf to accumulate shares in cyanotech while at the same time he has entered into agreements with rsf by which he retains an interest in those shares  cyanotechs q reports that the shares of company common stock owned by rsf are held by rsf in an endowment fund for the benefit of ginungagap foundation a nonprofit corporation and mr davis serves as the president of ginungagap the recent sec filings by cyanotech and davis confirm the following · all of the shares held by rsf are directly traceable to skywords a daviscontrolled entity either as gifts of shares or gifts of cash used by buy shares in a transaction instigated by davis · the timing of the davis gifts corresponds with davis need to manage his direct holdings to maintain an ownership level below  · rsf holds and serves as the reporting entity for all of the shares it acquired via davis actions but did not spend any of its own capital on the shares and does not hold the shares for its own benefit but rather for the benefit of ginungagap · ginungagap like skywords is a daviscontrolled entity undisclosed group according to the sec a group is formed when two or more persons agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring holding voting or disposing of equity securities of a public company  when a group is present the group must report its combined holdings on the applicable schedule here is what cyanotech and davis have disclosed about davis relationship with rsf · agreement relating to the holding of securities  from cyanotechs form q the shares of company common stock owned by rsf are held by rsf in an endowment fund for the benefit of ginungagap foundation a nonprofit corporation and mr davis serves as the president of ginungagap  the terms of the written agreement between ginungagap and rsf regarding the endowment permit ginungagap to make nonbinding recommendations to rsf with regards to the investment of the endowment fund · agreement relating to the acquisition of securities  from davis schedule d in  davis learned that a significant cyanotech customer and shareholder wished to sell its shares of common stock approximately  of the issuer he put the shareholder in touch with rsf in or about the same time skywords donated approximately  million to rsf with the understanding that rsf may use some or all of the funds to attempt to purchase shares of common stock · agreement relating to the disposal of securities from davis d the terms of the agreement permit ginungagap to make nonbinding recommendations to rsf with regards to the investment of the endowment and to request grants from that fund to ginungagap the special committees summary report on form k acknowledged the presence of group elements the special committee notes that certain of the facts relating to the relationship between mr davis and rsf could be consistent with the existence a group and the special committee has therefore recommended that mr davis consider whether or not a group exists and in any case that mr davis include additional disclosures in his filings under the exchange act regarding the relationship between mr davis and rsf in his subsequent schedule d filing davis and his related entities expressly disclaim that a group within the meaning of section d of the act exists between any of davis and such entities and rsf  this claim by davis appears inconsistent with the other recent disclosures made by davis and cyanotech cited above and with the following   · rsf has never acted with respect to the acquisition or holding of cyanotech stock without the instigation and direct involvement of davis · rsf has never expended any of its own capital to acquire shares of cyanotech every share held by rsf was originally acquired or paid for by davis · other than the  million provided by davis that was used by rsf to acquire the  block there is no record that davis has made cash donations to rsf · other than with respect to cyanotech rsf has never held more than a  equity interest in any public company · the transaction in which rsf acquired the  block – an international privatelynegotiated block trade of nearly  of a public company – is unusual for a nonprofit and involved not a random company but a company in which michael davis was already the largest shareholder with such transaction resulting in rsf becoming the companys second largest shareholder  around the same time davis and rsf collaborated on the purchase of the  block davis became chairman of the board of cyanotech · all of rsfs shares are the result of gifts from davis skywords foundation  all the shares held by rsf are held for the benefit of ginungagap  michael davis is the president of both skywords and ginungagap and both skywords and ginungagap share office space with michael davis in tiburon california meridian is always interested in hearing from fellow stockholders and has

of the reporting entities  the aggregate amount used by the reporting entities to purchase the shares is  item   purpose of transaction the meridian entities have purchased the shares for investment purposes  the meridian entities have changed their filing status from that of a schedule g filer to that of a schedule d filer due to their changed perspective with respect to the need for new directors and stockholder participation in the companys governance process cyanotech is a small public company with great products leading brands and a stable and profitable operating business  on top of this meridian believes the company has tremendous growth and valuecreation potential in its emerging astaxanthin product line  meridian is confident that many followers of the company believe as it does that cyanotech has the ability to deliver truly exceptional returns to its stockholders  yet the company has of late been pursuing actions that are both inexplicable and unexplained about meridian meridian is an investment firm specializing in small public companies  over the past  years meridians principals have made material investments in more than  such businesses  our model involves taking large stakes in companies we believe to be significantly undervalued by the market  we believe such discounts are created by a variety of inefficiencies common among small cap public companies  one of the most frequently cited of these inefficiencies is the general absence of analyst coverage  we believe the lack of analyst coverage creates opportunities for firms such as meridian that are able to do their own primary research in the case of cyanotech that primary research has been extensive as we began not knowing much about growing algae or harvesting astaxanthin  in this investment meridian also had to overcome the challenges associated with cyanotechs practice of conducting no outbound investor relations – the company conducts no earnings calls participates in no investor conferences does no investor road shows and as far as we know hasnt even produced a corporate powerpoint as it does with all of its investments meridian has made periodic company site visits over the last two years in order to see firsthand the operations of the business and to personally meet with key personnel in these meetings we have always come away very impressed by the knowledge and passion of the companys employees and this has contributed to meridians optimism about cyanotech and its prospects about cyanotech cyanotech was formed in  and has been public since   for much of its history cyanotech focused on growing its algae products selling them in bulk form to third parties that pursued various commercial uses  the company regularly did  to  million per year in sales managing its business more often than not to deliver a small profit  this situation has changed over recent years as the company has experienced periods of significant growth as it has introduced and developed its new astaxanthin product line  this growth has been largely the result of a shift from bulk to retail sales  cyanotech currently has the leading retail brand in astaxanthin with  market share in the natural foods channel top ranking on leading consumer websites including amazon a category partnership with costco and it has recently established a firstmover advantage in china  this recent retail and brand success was developed under the leadership of a team of managers hired into the company in   the team led by ceo brent bailey had previously worked together at nature made leading that business to becoming the topselling vitamin and supplements brand in the united states meridian acquired its shares over the last two years based upon the prospects of the business plan being pursued by cyanotech management team starting in   that plan is understood to be similar to the business plan pursued by the companys management team while building the nature made brand  when during the first half of calendar year  this business model appeared to be working as evidenced by rising production sales and margins the market responded lifting the companys stock price to levels above   when beginning in the second half of calendar year  this model appeared to be stymied as evidenced by stalled sales and disclosure of persistent production difficulties the stock quickly declined hitting a multiyear intraday low of  on february   while obviously disappointed by the setbacks experienced by cyanotech while it pursued its business plan meridian has remained confident that cyanotech would solve its production problems and capitalize on the significant opportunities its market development efforts have created  the production difficulties are clearly not insurmountable  it is wellknown that cyanotechs practice of growing astaxanthin in open ponds is extremely difficult – indeed cyanotech is the worlds only major producer of astaxanthin that utilizes this production technique  other major producers use enclosed systems that protect the algae from environmental factors  such enclosed systems are not novel to astaxanthin web research turns up countless examples of algae farming systems utilizing bioreactors and glass tubes  from meridians perspective only time is necessary for the company to overcome its production difficulties allowing product supply to rise to meeting the expanding market demand for cyanotechs astaxanthin this very favorable situation potentially changed dramatically on april   when it was announced that cyanotechs ceo had resigned and was no longer with the company  given disclosure the same day of a rich severance agreement likely more than  million in incremental costs will be charged to the company in q fy there can be little doubt that the ceo did not leave voluntarily but why would cyanotech fire a ceo with great experience running a supplements business particularly given that ceos obvious success in developing awareness and demand for the companys products  cyanotech is experiencing challenges but it is clear even to outside stockholders that those problems are on the production side not the sales side of the business  but for the production issues the company would be enjoying significantly higher sales and most likely a much higher stock price  was the ceo held accountable for the production problems in hawaii  alternatively was he held accountable for the litigation infrastructure and sales and marketing costs that have reduced the companys profitability during the recent periods that have lacked growth it cannot logically be that the companys board of directors forced the ceos resignation due to their dissatisfaction with the companys efforts to correct the production problems  this is because i the former ceo was hired for his sales and marketing abilities on the mainland not his expertise in growing algae in hawaii and ii the person the board put in to replace the ceo in an interim capacity is the companys longterm designated expert in growing algae in hawaii  it is almost certain that the interim ceo has far more direct accountability for the companys production problems than does the recently departed ceo  thus the production problems cannot be the grounds on which the former ceo was forced to resign the rising costs then  yes but those rising costs would have been more than offset by the rising sales the company would have experienced but for the production problems  the business plan is perfectly sound – all that is necessary is for cyanotech and its stockholders to persevere until the production problems are resolved  that at least is meridians view cyanotechs board of directors apparently has a completely different view and they have taken action  not to address the production issues but rather to address and meridian fears alter the business plan  the former ceo was hired to repeat the success he had with nature made and in pursuing that business plan he has had tremendous success  the markets strong awareness and demand for the companys products appears to far outstrip the companys ability to produce those products  except for the unexpected and hopefully temporary production issues the business model cyanotech has been pursuing for the last several years has been a success  unless meridian is wrong in believing the production issue will be resolved the only business explanation for the ceos ouster is the boards decision to alter or abandon the ceos business plan characteristically cyanotechs stockholders have been left in the dark  why is the company having so much trouble resolving the production issues  what solutions are being pursued  when will the solutions be implemented allowing the company to resume growth  why was the ceo forced to resign  does the change in personnel mean a change in the business plan having invested so much time and effort into understanding cyanotechs business and the potential for its astaxanthin products and having made a substantial investment in the company based upon the prospects of its business plan under the leadership of proven executives meridian is not comfortable with recent developments  maybe the boards decisions and actions were wellfounded but given the companys unusual communication policies we do not know nor can we expect to ever be properly informed clearly meridian is not alone with its questions and concerns  since the news of the ceos departure cyanotechs stock price has fallen and the trading volume has plummeted  indicative of how uncertain those outside the company are about its future valensas ceo has taken over the yahoo message board apparently believing cyanotech to now be so bereft of leadership that it is possible for him to influence the companys future direction via his posts  this confusion and investor uncertainty is unacceptable for a public company why is meridian invested in cyanotech meridian only invests in companies that it believes are significantly undervalued  generally one is much more likely to find significantly undervalued companies amid small and microcap names and therefore it is in this space that meridian exclusively invests  the benefits of investing in quality microcaps is wellknown as it is easy to find articles and data showing that microcaps deliver higher longterm performance than any other public equity class the rationale for meridians investment in cyanotech is very straightforward  astaxanthin is a new supplement category  it is a natural and highlyeffective antioxidant and antiinflammatory with benefits that meridian believes will attract consumers from across the retail spectrum from serious athletes seeking help in recovering from extreme physical exertions to seniors looking for relief from chronic inflammation related to arthritis  awareness and demand for astaxanthin exploded in  prompting a worldwide rush of companies seeking to increase supply and win market share  cyanotech won the contest for market share – almost certainly due to its good fortune of having recently put in place a management team experienced in retail supplements and new product introductions  meridian believes cyanotechs bioastin hawaiian astaxanthin® brand has the potential to be the categoryidentifying brand eg like kleenex® is to facial tissue and xerox® is to copy machines as awareness and demand for astaxanthin grows cyanotechs astaxanthin products are wellpositioned to retain their current outsized market share allocation  the companys strong and friendly relationship with costco is extremely relevant in this regard  costco is a single channel partner through whom cyanotech can efficiently drive market awareness and brandidentification within a highlyfavorable demographic group  costco is an enormous distributor of consumer supplements and a very strong and trusted brand in its own right  for many costco shoppers learning that costco sells something is reason enough to considering buying that something cyanotech announced the launch of its lead astaxanthin product in  mainland costco locations in september   within months that test market was obviously considered a success and additional stores were being added  today cyanotechs astaxanthin is sold in approximately  of costcos more than  warehouse locations  costco was already cyanotechs largest customer as of march   adding  additional locations has the potential to not just increase but significantly increase cyanotechs revenues meridians valuation models for cyanotech are based upon the companys anticipated future cash flows  because meridian sees cyanotechs business as likely benefiting from substantial operating leverage as the company grows we believe the company should experience strong and rising cash flows and a significantly higher stock price  even when modeling scenarios with results that meridian would view as disappointing we see cyanotechs business being worth at least  per share in the near future meridians first purchase of cyanotech shares occurred on june   at  per share  at that time the company was spending heavily defending itself against a patent infringement claim filed by valensa  meridian did substantial diligence on the litigation independently obtaining and reviewing hundreds of court filings  we concluded that the action against cyanotech was without merit and that even were cyanotech to lose the litigation the resulting judgment was unlikely to be material  believing market concern over the litigation likely presented a buying opportunity meridian acquired approximately  shares  of its current position below  per share during the period ending in early november  the next period of cyanotechs stock history began following the companys release of q fy results on november    the stock surged on news of significant growth driven by a  increase in its retail products business  meridian was so impressed by this surprise performance that it purchased more than  shares the day after the news broke at prices above  per share  over the next six months cyanotech stock steadily rose reaching a peak price above  per share in late june   during this period meridian acquired an additional  shares at an average price of   this included thousands of shares purchased at prices as high as  in june   such purchases appeared to make sense at the time given the companys very strong growth and increasing gross margin cyanotech reported gross margin of  during its q fy vs  reported for its q fy  in addition the patent litigation had been resolved in cyanotechs favor the first trigger for the significant stock price decline that would follow was cyanotechs press release on june   reporting that there would be a delay in the planned filing of its fiscal year end financial statements  there being no disclosure of the reason for this delay the market reacted negatively falling from above  to around  over the next two weeks  the stock fell further to  per share following cyanotechs release of its year end results and then drifted lower to around  over the subsequent months  during this period meridian acquired slightly less than  shares at progressively lower prices  these purchases brought meridians stake in the company to just under  when cyanotech reported results for q fy  before the market open on february   the companys stock price collapsed  the overall market also opened down with the dow jones off by more than  points  meridians premarket orders at prices above  where quickly executed and despite new orders and heavy buying by meridian cyanotechs stock price continued to fall eventually reaching a year intraday low of   meridian ended up buying almost  shares on that day and the next with most shares purchased below   these purchases took the meridian group above a  position in the company necessitating that meridian group begin reporting all of its subsequent transaction on sec form  such filings are required within  business days of any transactions executed by a holder or group with a greater than  position after pausing for several days to make its required filings and to evaluate whether it should continue purchasing cyanotech shares meridian resumed its buying on february   picking up  shares  about a week later meridian purchased another  shares  over the next week meridian purchased an additional  shares  at this point it was meridians intent to gradually add to its position in cyanotech with small purchases continuing until such time as the stock was trading at prices above meridians average purchase price this is known as an averaging down buying strategy meridians average cost per share is currently  we believed it wise to continue our averaging down buying due to meridians continued belief that cyanotechs business plan would eventually get back on track delivering value that would eventually cause the stock to trade for  or more per share  over the course of its entire investment meridian had identified only four possible risks to its investment thesis  astaxanthin proves to be nothing more than a consumer fad destined to rise and then fall as consumers move on to the next hot supplement  extensive research into the efficacy of astaxanthin including frequent reference to the national institutes of healths us national library of medicine available at httpwwwncbinlmnihgovpubmed and the nearly  articles published there some of which date all the way back to  convinced meridian that astaxanthin is not destined to be a consumer fad  meridians analysis of the patent litigation in  could have proven to be wrong  it was not the litigation was settled in cyanotechs favor  cyanotech might never succeed in increasing its astaxanthin production  meridians answer to this risk has always been that while growing the algae that produces astaxanthin is difficult forcing every other large grower in the world to use bioreactor systems those other growers have proven that bioreactors work  if cyanotech could not find ways to increase and improve production in its open ponds it could shift to a bioreactor or hybrid growing process  cyanotech has stated within its press releases that it is actively pursuing such production changes  cyanotech might take so long to execute on its production changes that it could lose its market leadership position due to its inability to supply the astaxanthin demanded by its potential customers  for example a new supplier of astaxanthin has recently been added to costcos website  meridian does not know if this new supplier was brought on board due to cyanotechs supply shortage but it is clearly a signal from costco that it can and will look beyond cyanotech within this product category  concerned that cyanotechs production changes might be delayed due to a lack of currentlyavailable funds to finance them meridian has three times offered to help the company by providing the necessary funds in whatever structure would work best for the company – equity debt or joint venture  each time meridian was told that cyanotechs board of directors was considering meridians offer the current situation at cyanotech the risk that meridian did not identify was the possibility that cyanotech would abandon or put at risk the business plan being executed by brent bailey and his team  but as explained above this is the only explanation meridian can now rationalize for the april   forced resignation of mr bailey cyanotechs outside stockholders currently have no idea what is going on inside the company  the result has been market paralysis  since april   the day the ceo was forced to resign cyanotech has averaged barely  shares per day – at a  share valuation thats only  per day the recent action by cyanotechs board of directors and the decision to provide no explanation for the action or to provide any guidance as to the future direction of the company has effectively stripped all of the companys shareholders of investment liquidity  cyanotech is suddenly without the principal benefit of a public listing  there is no reason to believe cyanotechs board of directors has any plan to address this problem given that it is a company that appears to have a steadfast policy of conducting no outbound investor relations meridian is a specialist investor in small public companies and has a long and successful history of working with management and boards of directors struggling in managing their public company status  we believe cyanotech needs help and that we can provide that help  meridian also believes that cyanotechs board of directors would receive substantial benefit from adding to its ranks the perspective of an outside investor that has carefully followed the companys ups and downs over recent years  among the changes meridian would promote to the companys board of directors is a much more open communication policy that anticipates the needs of market participants in understanding and evaluating the companys business prior to making this filing meridian communicated with cyanotechs board of directors and expressed its interest in having one or more of its wellqualified representatives join cyanotechs board  meridian reserves the right to take additional actions should cyanotechs board react unfavorably to meridians request  given its investment in cyanotech and meridians strong belief in the future potential of the company meridian does not believe it can stand by and watch should the company appear to be turning away from all the work done in recent years to create the growth opportunities now before cyanotech and its stockholders

shareholder derivative action on behalf of cyanotechs stockholders against the company its chairman of the board of directors and the rudolf steiner foundation rsf  the civil complaint filed in the united states district court for the district of nevada seeks declaratory and injunctive relief under the securities exchange act of  and the nevada control share statute due to the undisclosed group created by the chairman and rsf and that groups ability to control cyanotech meridian also claims that the misrepresentations or omissions of material facts by the chairman caused cyanotech to violate section b of the securities exchange act of   finally meridian claims that the chairmans actions breached his fiduciary duties as a member of the board of directors of cyanotech a copy of meridians complaint may be obtained at the following address httpsdrivegooglecomopenidbmjsiczqprkaezrtethdxqtquu meridian brought its claims in federal court after cyanotechs board of directors failed to take action with respect to numerous securities disclosure and corporate governance deficiencies detailed by meridian in a letter to the board of directors  on may   meridian delivered the letter to cyanotechs interim ceo who is also a board member and encouraged him to first share the letter with the chairman of the companys audit committee and then for these two directors to consider engaging legal counsel independent of cyanotechs chairman to consider the contents of the letter and appropriate next steps  meridian believed the companys audit committee chairman would be the person on the board with the most relevant experience and greatest ability to investigate the matters described in the letter since delivering the may   letter meridian has received no indication that cyanotechs board of directors has taken action to address the issues raised by the letter  to the contrary on may   the company issued a press release reporting that the chairman of its audit committee had resigned from the board of directors on may    one possible interpretation of this news is that the audit chairman attempted to take the appropriate actions in response to meridians may   letter was blocked and therefore considered it impossible to continue to serve on cyanotechs board of directors  meridian believes the audit chairmans resignation is further evidence of the inability of the cyanotech board to function properly under the leadership of its current chairman once again meridian must emphasize that the four directors serving on cyanotechs board with the chairman as they comprise a majority of the board have the ability to exercise control over the company  meridian continues to believe that the first step should involve these four directors engaging legal counsel that is independent of the chairman  meridian believes that the newly appointed audit committee chairman having prior experience as the ceo of one public company and the cfo of another has the experience the standing and the ability to access independent outside legal counsel that could make him the catalyst to launching a reform process at cyanotech  given the historical practices of
