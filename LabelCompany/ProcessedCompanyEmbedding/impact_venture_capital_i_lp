social venture capital firms that you should know about  pm categories businesses funding by admin  comments if you like this post subscribe via email or rsstweetbuilding a business is hard getting the funding you might need is tough  but as you know when your business satisfies a social or environmental need your options for funding are even scarcer  one of the things i hear a lot from social entrepreneurs is the tough time they have finding people willing to fund them  traditional investors see the social component of their business as a discount on return on investment if there’s a financial cost shortor longterm of the business’ social component it’s viewed as a lousy investment choice  forprofit social enterprises are also excluded from foundation and donationbased funding sources there’s a small pool of social venture firms that evaluate a business on its social and environmental performance as well as its financial success who are these firms what types of social enterprises are they looking to support and how can you connect with them i spoke with kevin jones cofounder of good capital and the socap conference to bring you answers to these questions  you can listen to the interview here  this post was prompted by an email i got this morning from a women looking for funding options for her social enterprise by jake at dresshead  below are some progressive
