resources make implementation much less of a pain looking forward to continued learning and will be attending saucecon what do you dislikerunning regression test suites takes longer than running

resources to assist with troubleshooting as well as help from specialists from sauce labs at least give them a try with a free trial to see if it is a viable solution for your testingwhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedour application is quite massive and we were limiting ourselves to only  browsers and a handful of browsers versions when

december  validated reviewverified current userwhat do you like bestthat theyre nimble and allow me to tackle the testing challenges i face there are a number of real device testing platforms out there including sauce ive tried many many of them i ended up settling on sauce due to a number of factors from mindset on device availability ease of use communication with my account team technology and pricing while their device list may not be as big as some other vendors i never have to wait for any devices and im able to run on all of their devices whenever i want on top of that i dont have to pay separately for both access to a device and concurrency the both type of billing model really doesnt sit well with me nor does having to schedule a device sit in a queue for one or flat out not have your test run in an environment where development teams practice ci having to wait in line or even worse schedule doesnt match up what do you dislikesometimes my tests dont complete which makes stability tough but these things are improving sometimes troubleshooting why my tests failed is difficult real device pool is limited while they are continuing to add devices and its still somewhat early days its still something id love to see expandedrecommendations to others considering the productgive them a shot what business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you

browser and os combinations is invaluable and its ci integration with jenkins has made it an important part of our atdd without the ci integration we wouldnt have been able to include this is our development process so i would argue that is one of the most important inclusions they have addedwhat do you dislikeon rare occasions tests can sometimes fail for no reason and then work after running again this isnt a huge problem but can be somewhat annoying also inevitably it takes longer to spin up a vm and run a test on that instead of just testing locally but this is the tradeoff necessary in order to get the benefits sauce labs has to offerrecommendations to others considering the productdefinitely give it a trywhat business problems are you solving with the product what benefits have you realizedthis has helped greatly as our company switches from a waterfall method to an agile method of software development this is the biggest benefit it has for my organization as this transition has

and their engineers are very knowledgeablewhat do you dislikei dislike that at times their infrastructure code gets updated without the knowledge of the user i then without having updated anything see breaking issues or with esthetics of the test results this in turn causes wasted time trying to figure out what went wrong and where which always ends up in sending a customer support ticket to sauce labsrecommendations to others considering the productyou need to account for the performance decrease of funneling your tests through sauce cloud your framework is probably smart but not smart enough
