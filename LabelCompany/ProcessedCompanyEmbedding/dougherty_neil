dougherty came to the area in  after graduating from the uc berkeley college of agriculture and then serving in world war i he was employed as assistant agricultural superintendent for the sutter basin corporation where he was responsible for testing all of the soils in the area he later became agricultural superintendent when the company liquidated its holdings neil purchased  acres of good irrigated land and began farming upon his death in  his soninlaw bill dougherty a graduate from west point and a fighter pilot in the korean war took over the operation bill grew rice and wheat at that time in the late s bill’s sons neil and dan began working on the ranch too neil worked on the farm while getting his bs in agricultural economics at uc davis and was later joined by his older brother dan who had graduated from the air force academy until neil and dan began farming dougherty farms was primarily a rice growing operation they expanded the business established dougherty brothers and increased the size of the farm neil and dan were early innovators and the first farmers in the area to use lasers to level the land and adopt drip irrigation now in addition to rice they produce tomatoes sunflowers corn beans and vine seed they are also certified organic growers neil and dan quickly learned that irrigating tomatoes on rice ground was tricky although the heavy clay soils produce a sweeter tomato it takes great care to keep the plants alive in that soil type and they have spent many years working to improve their methods today they use gps technology to guide tractors monitor yields and calibrate fertilizer and chemical applications this allows them to reduce the number of passes through the field which saves fuel maximizes efficiency and reduces fertilizer and chemical usage these tools have enabled them to increase their tons per acre while decreasing their water usage and inputs being as efficient as possible with their resources and leaving the ground in better condition than they found it is a tenant of dougherty brothers and neil and dan continue to look for new ways to achieve that goal these values fit in perfectly with

deathnastronautscom nealdaughertycom artist statement i am rather like a travelling salesman i deal in ideas i do much more for people than just paint them pictures  martin kippenberger the world i live in is full of visual evidence of contemporary culture i look to this visual evidence to understand my place within it i find the saturation of media and cyber culture to be useful fuel and fodder for my work every digital nuance becomes visual poetry interlaced stills of digital video artifacts of a jpeg picture crass and unapologetic memes all become elements of my digital palette humor helps me explore difficult or pointed subject matter it helps me understand that my research can be more open to individual interpretation i adhere to the thinking of “if you are going to offend anyone offend everybody equally” humor in my work helps me bridge cultural stereotypes and literal observations of humanity regarding prints i realize my prints in digital processes photoshop has become an important tool in interpreting this digital media in which i am saturated i can quickly prototype my print digitally and repurpose the imagery into traditional print mediums and mixed media installations experimental works with nonsilver photographic processes and digital presentation techniques add to my methodology and provide different layers to the construction or deconstruction of my imagery and its translation into a print inspiration a long time ago when i was first starting to work on digital imagery and culture i stumbled upon a very enigmatic image the image was designed using only ascii characters and one of the first animated gifs that i had discovered it was an awakening experience for me and my work when i think of this image i think of what it represents to my unique ideals the figure seems to be almost neanderthal in nature walking erect for the first time this image blurs the lines between gender race or age to me this iconic image exemplifies our evolution into a new digital age a digital age that will define all our endeavours to one degree or another the trick will be how far humans are willing to evolve to meet this new age   keysight
