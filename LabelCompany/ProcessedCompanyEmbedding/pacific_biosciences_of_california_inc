biosciences of california inc is a biotechnology company founded in  that develops and manufactures systems for gene sequencing and some novel real time biological observation they describe their platform as single molecule real time sequencing smrt based on the properties of zeromode waveguides their first commercial product the pacbio rs was sold to a limited set of customers in  and was commercially released in early  a new version of the sequencer called the pacbio rs ii was released in april  on  september  a partnership between pacific biosciences and roche diagnostics was announced for the development of in vitro diagnostic products using the technology with roche providing us in the deal in  the company launched a new sequencing instrument called the sequel system with approximately fold greater capacity than the pacbio rs ii contents  history  recognitions  going public  products  sequencing instruments  reagents  pc chemistry  pc chemistry  pc chemistry  key publications  references  external links historyedit the company was founded based on research done at cornell university that combined semiconductor processing and photonics with biotechnology research it was initially founded under the name nanofluidics inc the company raised nearly us in six rounds of primarily venture capital financing making it one of the most capitalized startups in  leading up to their public offering in october of that year key investors included mohr davidow ventures kleiner perkins caufield  byers alloy ventures and wellcome trust recognitionsedit the company received the technology pioneer award from the world economic forum in  in  the scientist named the company and their first product the top life science innovation of the year and the company received the  advanced sequencing technology award from the national human genome research institute technology review magazine included them in their list of the top  most innovative companies for both  and  founder and chief technical officer dr stephen turner was awarded the  ewing marion kauffman foundation outstanding postdoctoral entrepreneur award for his work at the company going publicedit pacific biosciences first offered stock on nasdaq under the symbol pacb they sold  shares at an initial price of  per share and raised approximately  million in an initial public offering of stock on october   productsedit sequencing instrumentsedit the company’s first scientific instrument called the “pacbio rs” was released to a limited set of eleven customers in late  sequencing provider gatc biotech was selected by pacific biosciences as its first european service provider in late  the product was then commercially released in early  a new version of the sequencer called the pacbio rs ii was released in april  it produces longer sequence reads and offers higher throughput than the original instrument in september  the company announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument the sequel system the sequencer has increased capacity with  million zeromode waveguides compared to  in the pacbio rs ii and is approximately onethird the size and onehalf the price of the pacbio rs ii pacific biosciences said it would ship about  of the new instruments in the final quarter of  a pacbio rsii sequencer to use the instrument customers must also purchase reagent packs for dna preparation and sequencing and small plastic cells called “smrt cells” each cell is slightly less than one centimeter square and contains thousands of zeromode waveguides the cells are sold in packs of eight their secondary analysis bioinformatics product called “smrt analysis” is open source in  the company released new bioinformatics tools for automated genome assembly hgap and finishing to  accuracy quiver in may  they published an article in nature methods showing that their instrument can detect methylation of dna strands without altering the dna in  scientists used smrt sequencing to generate full bacterial methylomes reagentsedit pc chemistryedit on oct   pacbio announced the release of new chemistry pc which represents the companys th generation of polymerase and th generation chemistry further extends the average read length to    bases with the longest reads exceeding  bases the throughput with the new chemistry is expected to be between  million to  billion bases per smrt® cell depending on the sample being sequenced pc chemistryedit on oct   pacbio released new reagent combination for pacbio rs ii the p dna polymerase with c chemistry pc together they extend sequencing read lengths to an average of approximately  kb with the longest reads exceeding  bases throughput per smrt cell is around  million bp based on sequencing results from chm cell line pc chemistryedit on aug   pacbio released new dnapolymerase binding kit p this p enzyme has average read lengths of  bp when paired with the c sequencing chemistry and  bp when paired with the xl chemistry the enzyme’s accuracy is similar to c reaching qv between x and x coverage the resulting p attributes will provide you with higherquality assemblies using fewer smrt® cells and with improved variant calling this kit is compatible with both pacbio rs and pacbio rs ii instrument key publicationsedit before the first commercial release of their sequencer scientists published in january  the first sequence data generated from a single molecule real time sequencing in the journal science then in april  scientists published a paper in nature showing that they had used zeromode waveguides to perform realtime observation of ribosomal translation demonstrating the value for bacterial sequencing scientists from pacific biosciences and other institutions published in january  a paper in the new england journal of medicine demonstrating the origin of the  cholera outbreak in haiti in august  pacific biosciences scientists and collaborators at other organizations published a paper in the new england journal of medicine describing the classification of the e coli strain causing the virulent  outbreak in germany responsible for hundreds of cases of hemolytic–uremic syndrome this paper showed that the strain of e coli responsible for the outbreak had acquired a shigatoxin–encoding phage through lateral gene transfer in july  several papers were published in peerreview journals demonstrating methods to automate genome finishing for bacteria using single molecule realtime sequencing in  scientists estimated that the majority of bacterial and archaeal genomes could be fully sequenced and assembled to closure using pacbio long reads several papers published by researchers at pacific biosciences demonstrated that the sequencing instrument can be used to collect data on methylation dna damage and other epigenetic information the polymerase that performs the sequencing reaction in the zeromode waveguides produces kinetic data that can be used to distinguish base modifications in october  scientists used smrt sequencing to generate the methylomes of six bacteria reporting their results in a paper in nucleic acids research with increasing read length and throughput mammalian studies increased using the product in april  scientists from pacific biosciences the university of california and other institutes used smrt sequencing to prove the validity of activating internal tandem duplication mutations in flt as a therapeutic target in acute myeloid leukemia their findings were published in the journal nature in august  scientists at the broad institute published a paper reporting the findings of their evaluation of the pacific biosciences sequencer for snp calling and discovery scientists reported in genome research in october  the use of the pacbio platform to sequence the full repeat expansion in the fmr gene responsible for fragile x syndrome a paper published in december  offered the first demonstration of how to generate sequence data with the pacbio sequencer with no library preparation in  scientists published papers demonstrating the use of pacbio sequencing to analyze transcriptomes showing that long reads were able to fully capture complete

please refer to rule p form sd and the  act release no  for definitions to the terms used in this report unless otherwise defined herein ﻿ company overview ﻿ we design develop and manufacture sequencing systems to help scientists resolve genetically complex problems based on our novel single molecule realtime smrt ®  sequencing technology our products enable de novo genome assembly to finish genomes in order to more fully identify annotate and decipher genomic structures fulllength transcript analysis to improve annotations in reference genomes characterize alternatively spliced isoforms in important gene families and find novel genes targeted sequencing to more comprehensively characterize genetic variations and realtime kinetic information for epigenome characterization our technology provides high accuracy ultralong reads uniform coverage and is the only dna sequencing technology that provides the ability to simultaneously detect epigenetic changes pacbio ® sequencing systems including consumables and software provide a simple fast endtoend workflow for smrt sequencing ﻿ in september  we announced that we had launched a new nucleic acid sequencing platform the sequel tm  system which will provide higher throughput more scalability a reduced footprint and lower sequencing project costs compared to the pacbio ®  rs ii system while maintaining the existing benefits of our smrt technology ﻿ pacb conducted an analysis of its products and found that the sec defined “conflict minerals” namely tin tantalum tungsten and gold “tg” can be found in its pacbio ® rs ii instrument and the sequel tm   system therefore the products that pacb manufactures are subject to the reporting obligations of rule p ﻿ reasonable country of origin inquiry ﻿ our reasonable country of origin inquiry “rcoi” process began with an evaluation of our suppliers that provided materials components or products that became part of products pacb manufactured or contract to manufactured in  which it knew contained or were likely to contain tg minerals this evaluation consisted of examining internal records such as bills of materials or other product specifications and performing a qualitative review of purchasing records andor information provided by the supplier based on pacb’s evaluation it surveyed the suppliers of those materials components or products which it concluded contained or were likely to contain tg minerals the suppliers were asked to report on the presence of any tg minerals in the goods sold to us in cases where pacb confirmed that tg minerals were present it asked the applicable supplier to submit information to us about the country of origin of the tg minerals ﻿ due diligence ﻿ in accordance with the rules pacb performed due diligence procedures to determine the conflict minerals status of the tg minerals used in its products in conducting its due diligence pacb implemented the organization for economic cooperation and development “oecd” due diligence guidance for responsible supply chains of minerals from conflictaffected and highrisk areas the “oecd framework” an internationally recognized due diligence framework  the company designed its due diligence process management and measures within the oecd framework for a company downstream in the supply chain ﻿ as a company in the dna sequencing market pacb is several levels removed from the actual mining of tg pacb does not make purchases of raw ore or unrefined tg and makes no purchases of tg directly from the democratic republic of the congo “drc” or an adjoining country together the “covered countries”   the following is a summary of the due diligence actions that pacb has taken with regard to the reporting period for which this cmr is submitted ﻿  establish strong company management systems ﻿ · established an internal management team and coordinator to ensure compliance with respect to the reporting requirements relating to conflict minerals pacb’s internal management team consists of or works with representatives from supply chain and procurement engineering legal and finance ﻿ · defined the scope of pacb’s conflict minerals due diligence by identifying and reaching out to current suppliers that provide components or engage in manufacturing activities that are likely to contain tg ﻿ · determined data gathering and assessment procedures in order to understand the scope of pacb’s supply chain inquiry ﻿  identify and assess risks in the supply chain ﻿ · adopted the standard conflict minerals reporting template established by the electronic industry citizenship coalition “eicc” and global esustainability initiative “gesi” for data collection and verification pacb requested productlevel information from its tier  suppliers on the parts and products it purchased from them ﻿ · in an effort to increase awareness of pacb’s conflict minerals program pacb provided suppliers with background materials describing the conflict minerals rule leading industry initiatives conflict minerals tracing reporting requirements and other guidelines and resources relating to conflict minerals ﻿ · relied on these supplier’s responses to provide pacb with information about the source of conflict minerals contained in the components supplied to pacb pacb’s direct suppliers of tg minerals are similarly reliant upon information provided to them by their respective suppliers ﻿ · pacb reviewed and evaluated all supplier responses for consistency and completeness as well as the origin of those materials    ﻿  design and implement a strategy to respond to identified risks ﻿ · the status and findings of pacb’s rcoi and due diligence efforts were reported to senior management ﻿ · pacb followed a risk mitigation plan that is consistent with its conflict minerals approach if a smelter or refiner in the supply chain were known to be sourcing from a mine within a covered country which directly or indirectly finances or benefits armed groups pacb would consider all available options including but not limited to making changes to its sourcing of those items ﻿  independent thirdparty audits of smelter or refiner’s due diligence practices ﻿ pacb use resources from the gesi and oecd including their conflict free smelter lists and conflictfree sourcing initiative “cfsi” resources  as a downstream company pacb’s due diligence efforts rely on crossindustry initiatives such as a “conflict free” designation from the conflict free smelter program cfsp led by the cfsi  the cfsi is a global leader for the responsible sourcing of minerals and provides information on conflictfree smelters and refiners common tools to gather sourcing information and forums for exchanging best practices on addressing conflicts minerals ﻿    report on supply chain due diligence ﻿ pacb plans to continue to report annually to the sec by filing a form sd and conflict minerals report as required by applicable law ﻿ findings and conclusion ﻿ pacb sent out surveys to the  suppliers identified in its due diligence efforts and received responses from  suppliers providing a  response rate a significant improvement was noted with regards to the completeness and quality of responses pacb received from its suppliers in  compared to prior years  of the responses received in   were acceptable at the company level compared to only  in  where “company level” refers to reports that do not identify the smelters or refiners used for a particular part component or business customer bur rather report the data for all of the company’s product lines in the aggregate  however suppliers and manufacturers generally provided facility information at the company level representing the suppliers’ and manufacturers’ entire product lines and generally did not limit their responses to facility information for covered minerals in products they supply to pacb specifically  in  only four suppliers provided responses specific to pacb products “product level” compared to zero in   ﻿ out of the  responses received  stated that their products do not contain tg minerals  stated that the tg minerals were not sourced from the covered countries  stated that at least some of their tg minerals were sourced from covered countries and  stated that they were uncertain as to the origin of the tg minerals in their products or did not provide sufficient information to adequately determine the source  of the  suppliers that stated that at least some of their tg minerals were sourced from covered countries  noted that all of their products were from sources certified as being conflict free active in the process to obtain conflict free certification or had complete control from mine to production  the remaining sources were uncertified or had an unknown certification status  however pacb has not identified any known instances in which any tg minerals were sourced directly or indirectly from armed groups of the conflict region of the covered countries ﻿ of the  suppliers whose responses indicated that their products may contain tg sourced from the covered countries all but one of those suppliers responded at a company level as a result many of those smelters identified in a company level declaration by pacb’s suppliers may not actually be involved in the products supplied to pacb ﻿ based on the representation made by its suppliers pacb does not have sufficient information to determine whether its supply chain is “drc conflictfree” for calendar  pacb has been unable to determine the origin of all tg used in certain integrated circuits and other components used in the manufacturing of its instruments and related consumables this was due to a lack of information from its suppliers to conclude whether the tg minerals originated in the covered countries and if so whether the tg minerals were from recycle or scrap sources were drc conflict free or have not been found to be drc conflict free ﻿ future steps ﻿ pacb is continuing to develop methods implement tools and adopt procedures that are designed to be both auditable and in accordance with the oecd framework in the next compliance period pacb intends to continue to develop its processes in working with its suppliers to provide accurate and complete information regarding conflict mineral sourcing ﻿ additional risk factors and considerations ﻿ this cmr contains forward looking statements relating to actions that pacb may take in the future such statements are based on the current expectations of our management and are neither promises nor guarantees of future performance of the actions subsequent events and developments may cause management’s views to change while pacb may elect to update these forwardlooking statements at some point in the future it specifically disclaim any obligation to do so these forwardlooking statements should not be relied upon as representing the company’s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this report   ﻿ the statements above are based on the due diligence performed in good faith by pacb the statements are all based on information available at the time and many factors can introduce error impacting pacb’s conflict minerals status some factors could include but are not limited to unavailable supplier data incomplete supplier data incomplete smelter data errors or omissions in supplier or smelter responses and suppliers or smelter operators who are unfamiliar with the conflict minerals rule and protocols for responding to requests for information about conflict minerals  ﻿ suppliers and manufacturers generally provided facility information at the company level representing the suppliers’ and manufacturers’ entire product lines and generally did not limit their responses to facility information for covered minerals in products they supply to pacb specifically  ﻿ independent private sector audit ﻿ this cmr has not been subject to an independent private sector audit as allowed under rule p   ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ products  services  pacific biosciences  x quality statement pacific biosciences is committed to providing highquality products that meet customer expectations and comply
