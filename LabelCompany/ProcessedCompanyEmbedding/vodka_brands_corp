analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of vodka brands corp vodka brands the company we and our for three months ended march   compared to the three months ended march   the following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the year ended december   and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k our financial statements are stated in united states dollars and are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles our business we began operations on april   inception and operate within the alcoholic spirit industry through our operations we oversee the manufacturing of our blue diamond vodka and sell our product in the united states with hopes of expanding internationally we have a federal permit to import alcoholic beverages currently our customers include the pennsylvania liquor control board the alcoholic beverage control of mississippi we are also licensed in west virginia and tennessee and we have signed an agreement with a distributor in tennessee we anticipate a purchase order for the state of tennessee within the next several weeks we plan to continue to develop our trademarked name blue diamond brand as well as our other trademarked brands our cash on hand as of march   was  results of operations sales we generated sales of  for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   the decrease is due primarily to the lower order volumes during the three months ended march   we sold  bottles versus  bottles sold during the three months ended march   the most significant variable in product cost in the future is expected to be currency exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar our european suppliers invoice in euros we do not believe that inflation had any material impact on us during the three months ended march   and  we recognize revenue when four basic criteria have been met  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and  collection is reasonably assured with the introduction of blue diamond vodka as a shelf item in the state of pennsylvania two years ago our sales are currently to the pennsylvania liquor control board and can be found in roughly fortyfive of their stores if we were to lose this customer our operations would be materially impacted however we have the possibility to increase the number of stores in pennsylvania and much greater potential nationally and internationally to this end we continued to generate sales to the mississippi department of revenue during the three months ended march   our product is sold in approximately forty stores in mississippi in january  we began issuing customer incentives on our blue diamond vodka through the use of mailin rebate coupons revenues for the three months ended march   were reduced by estimated rebate costs of  cost of goods sold our cost of sales was  for the three months ended march   compared to  for the three months ended march   the increase in our cost of sales was primarily due to higher inventory storage costs gross profit we expect to be able to maintain a gross profit margin over  on our product selling general administrative and other expenses sga our most significant selling costs are promotional and advertising expenses as we continue to develop brand recognition the most significant general and administrative costs were legal and accounting expenses the market for spirits and vodka is large we have the potential to expand sales dramatically this will be determined in large part by our success in attracting distributors although we believe the market is large we are uncertain if our product will obtain significant demand additionally we are uncertain with regards to industry trends or events that will materially impact our operational condition whether beneficial or detrimental net loss we incurred a net loss of  for the three months ended march   and  for the three months ended march   we expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or possibly debt financing our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation deferred tax asset and valuation allowance we recorded a deferred tax asset but recorded a full valuation allowance against this asset as it is uncertain if we will be able to realize any of this benefit related parties during the period april   inception through december   we purchased all of our inventory from beverage brands inc bbi a wholly owned company of our ceo the purchase price was recorded at the price bbi paid for the product from a third party manufacturer additionally bbi acted as a conduit with a third party to facilitate sales to the pennsylvania liquor control board as we did not have our federal import license we obtained our federal import license in april of  there were no fees or expenses paid to or retained by bbi with regards to this arrangement during april  trademark holdings llc a wholly owned company of our ceo contributed the trademarks blue diamond diamond girl blue crystal and white crystal we recorded the trademarks at carryover basis and will continue to amortize these trademarks in accordance with their useful life from the date of registration liquidity and capital resources

flows from operating activities for the three months ended march   net cash used in operating activities was  and for the three months ended march   net cash used in operating activities was  the change was primarily a result in the purchase of our second production of blue diamond vodka in february  cash flows from financing activities we have financed our operations primarily from the issuance of shares of our common stock for the tree months ended march   net cash provided by financing activity was  and for the three months ended march   net cash provided by financing activities was  received from proceeds from issuance of our common stock to investors plan of operation and funding operations our overriding objective is to produce high quality vodka products with recognizable brand names and to expand distribution nationally and internationally we plan to increase sales of our blue diamond vodka brand and to develop our other brand names increase in sales of our existing brand can be achieved through the improvement in product packaging which has been ongoing promotional activities and forming relationships with distributors we can develop one or more of our other brand names in the next six to twelve months product development our blue diamond vodka bottle is produced in france and shipped to northern europe to the country of estonia to complete production current production of blue diamond vodka includes some noticeable improvements in product packaging funding we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business we paid for the second production run of  cases of blue diamond vodka in february  and we received the product in september  existing working capital and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months we have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements generally we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the sale of our common stock to investors in connection with our business plan management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to i developmental expenses associated with a startup business and ii marketing expenses we intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of equity or debt securities thereafter we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet longterm operating requirements additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders further such securities might have rights preferences or privileges senior to our common stock additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms or at all if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations material commitments as of

offbalance sheet arrangements as of the date of this quarterly report we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors going concern the report of the independent registered public accounting firm accompanying our annual report for the year ended december   financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial
